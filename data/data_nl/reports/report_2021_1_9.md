## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | rivm-app |
| **Website**  | [http://rivm.nl](http://rivm.nl) |
| **Email** | ict-servicedesk@rivm.nl |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=rivm-app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=rivm-app) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>CALL_PHONE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the call. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_PHONE_STATE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows read only access to phone state, including the phone number of the device, current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Wat is Luscii?
<br>Luscii maakt moderne zorg mogelijk. Met de Luscii app is het op voorschrift van een zorgorganisatie mogelijk om:
<br>- lichaamswaarden/symptomen in de gaten te houden
<br>- gerichte educatie te ontvangen over (omgaan met) ziekte of gezondheidsrisico's
<br>- op afstand te communiceren met zorgverleners
<br>Hoe werkt het?
<br>- Mensen dienen zich eerst aan te melden. Dat gaat normaal via een ziekenhuis. In geval van inzet in de corona crisis is aanmelden ook mogelijk op www.olvgcoronacheck.nl
<br>- De app vraagt dagelijks een aantal lichaamswaarden of symptomen door te geven. Deze zijn gebaseerd op een door zorgverleners voor de gebruiker ingesteld programma. Ook is er educatie in de app en contact op afstand.
<br>- Achter de app staat een medisch team paraat. Dit beoordeelt de antwoorden die gebruikers geven in de app (ondersteund door de techniek van de app). Als er een medische reden is om contact op te nemen, doen zij dat binnen 24 uur. Dat kan telefonisch of via een bericht. Ook is contact via beeldbellen mogelijk (let op: deze functie gebruikt OLVG corona check nog niet).
<br>OLVG corona check
<br>- Door de uitbraak van het coronavirus neemt de zorgvraag toe. Ziekenhuizen bereiden zich hierop voor door nieuwe middelen in te zetten naast de reguliere zorg. Samen met het Amsterdamse ziekenhuis OLVG heeft Luscii daarom de Luscii app hiervoor geschikt gemaakt. We noemen dit OLVG corona check.
<br>- OLVG corona check is bedoeld om grote groepen mensen met klachten die mogelijk door het coronavirus wordt veroorzaakt op afstand te kunnen begeleiden. Een medisch team beoordeelt de metingen die binnenkomen via de app van Luscii die voor OLVG corona check wordt gebruikt. OLVG corona check is gratis.
<br>- OLVG corona check is gestart voor mensen in de regio Groot Amsterdam. Er wordt gestreefd de regio's waarin de app beschikbaar is, uit te breiden. Meer informatie is te vinden op www.olvgcoronacheck.nl.
<br>Medisch hulpmiddel en gegevensverwerking
<br>Luscii is een CE gemarkeerd medisch hulpmiddel. Gegevens worden verwerkt volgens de Algemene Verordering Gegevensbescherming (AVG). Het privacyreglement en gebruikersvoorwaarden zijn te vinden op www.luscii.com. Luscii is gevestigd in Amsterdam, Nederland.

> Het is goed bedacht. Maar ik heb android versie 11 (oneplus 8) en die antwoorden waarbij je moet scrollen voor de cijfers doen het niet. Dus die had ik niet ingevuld.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CoronaMelder is de officiële corona notificatie-app van Nederland, ontwikkeld onder het toezicht van het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport. De app is een digitaal hulpmiddel bij het bron- en contactonderzoek door de GGD. 
<br>De app waarschuwt je nadat je in de buurt bent geweest van iemand met corona. Zo kun je jezelf en de mensen in je omgeving beschermen. En kunnen we samen het aantal besmettingen in Nederland zo laag mogelijk houden. Het gebruik van de app is vrijwillig. Niemand mag controleren of jij de app op je telefoon hebt. Maar hoe meer mensen de app gebruiken, hoe beter deze werkt. 
<br>Bij de ontwikkeling van deze app is rekening gehouden met toegankelijkheid, zie voor meer informatie onze toegankelijkheidsverklaring.
<br>Hoe werkt de app?
<br># Je geeft alleen toegang tot je bluetoothgegevens
<br>CoronaMelder ziet via bluetooth wanneer je in de buurt bent van andere mensen met de app. De app gebruikt geen persoons- of locatiegegevens. De app weet dus niet wie je bent, waar je was en wie je hebt ontmoet.
<br># Je krijgt een melding nadat je extra kans op besmetting hebt gelopen
<br>De app stuurt een melding als je minstens 15 minuten in de buurt bent geweest van iemand die later corona blijkt te hebben. Deze persoon moet ook de app gebruiken.
<br># Je kunt anderen waarschuwen als je zelf besmet blijkt te zijn
<br>Ben je getest door de GGD en blijk je corona te hebben? Dan kun je samen met de GGD via de app een melding sturen naar de mensen bij wie je in de buurt bent geweest - in de periode dat je besmettelijk was. In deze melding staat alleen wanneer ze in de buurt zijn geweest van een besmet persoon. Niet wie of waar dit was.
<br>Hoe gaat de app met je gegevens om?
<br>• Je hoeft geen persoonsgegevens zoals je e-mailadres of naam in te voeren.
<br>• Als je iemand tegenkomt wisselen jullie telefoons via bluetooth willekeurige codes uit. Zo meet de app de duur en de afstand van het contact. In de codes staat niets over wie jullie zijn en waar jullie zijn geweest. 
<br>• De codes die je via bluetooth uitwisselt worden alleen op je telefoon bewaard en na 14 dagen verwijderd.
<br>• Gebruikers van de app zijn niet terug te vinden door de makers van de app, de overheid of andere gebruikers.

> De melder werkt goed, ik heb 2 dagen geleden een corona-test gehad en moest wel 20 minuten wachten, mijn uitslag was negatief, ik krijg nu 2 dagen later een melding dat ik meer dan 15 minuten bij iemand in de buurt met corona ben geweest (dat was dus degene die voor of achter mij stond) Nu nog de mogelijkheid om dit in de app aan te geven ❤<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:09:18__

> Nog geen verdere ervaring.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 19:16:30__

> De app stoort niet het functioneren van mijn telefoon, computer programma's, gsm of tablet. Gebruiksvriendelijk! Prettig idee dat je weet waar je aan toe bent qua gezondheid in deze Coronatijd.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 08:37:57__

> Geen ervaring<br> :date: __2020-12-30 20:38:28__

> Kan altijd beter.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 13:59:32__

> Kreeg melding, ben in quarantaine gegaan en kwam de deur niet uit. Bleef melding krijgen. Gebeld met info nummer en kreeg bericht dat Bluetooth w.s. door de muur heen werkt ivm besmetting buren.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 11:08:16__

> Hij gaat de laatste tijd regelnatig zonaar opeens uit. Maar zo weer aan te klikken.wat kan ik daaraan doen? Dat uitgaan zou met piepen gemeld kunnen worden. Verder gelykkig nog geen meldingen<br> :date: __2020-12-29 09:42:08__

> Krijg regelmatig de melding dat er 24 uur niet gecontroleerd kon worden of iets dergelijks. Is de app op de een of andere manier niet actief. Géén idee waardoor. Nog geen andere melding gehad dus geen idee hoe de app functioneert maar dat zal verder best goed zijn.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 19:09:42__

> Heel overzichtelijk.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 07:40:46__

> Ik heb 3 december 2020 een melding gehad van een mogelijke besmetting op 25 november. Dus na 8 dagen. Ik heb me laten testen op 4 december,.om 10.12, omdat ik plasma zou geven op 5 december 14.00. De uitslag was er zaterdag morgen en negatief, dus kon ik in de middag plasma geven. Nu heb ik nog steeds de melding inzake 25 november op mojn app staan Kan een nieuwe melding nu wel binnen komen. Of m oiet ik de oude melding verwijderen.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 09:52:10__

> Ik krijg vaak de melding dat de app niet actief is. Maar als ik hem dan opent staat er dat hij wel actief is. Alles staat aan. Wifi, mobiele data, Bluetooth. Locatie gegevens.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 14:14:35__

> Ik heb de app, dat ik een melding krijg. In het begin diverse meldingen gehad, over aantal sleutels, waar ik dicht bij in de buurt was geweest. de laatst 2 maanden totaal niets meer. Blijkt dat hij al 2 maanden niet actief stond, zichzelf uitgeschakeld<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:12:05__

> Theorie lijkt goed, maar ik krijg steeds de melding dat er niet gecontroleerd jan worden. Laatste controle is inmiddels van 22 oktober. Zo schiet het niet op. Het probleem dat er niet gecontroleerd kon worden leek opgelost, maar sinds 1 januari krijg ik telkens weer de melding dat er 24 uur niet gecontroleerd kon worden en dat terwijl de batterijbesparing gewoon uit staat en ik geen instellingen heb veranderd.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 10:41:40__

> Nog geen melding gehad na de invoer erg slecht<br> :date: __2021-01-04 09:07:02__

> Vervelend dat de app zichzelf uitschakeld, ik heb hem al diverse keren opnieuw aan moeten zetten.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:33:08__

> Mis installatie focumentatie op apparaat niveau zosls Galaxy S9, etc<br> :date: __2021-01-02 20:16:36__

> ik geef 3 omdat het is aleen bei mensen dat dit app ook heben<br> :date: __2020-12-30 18:44:20__

> Geen GGD sleutel ontvangen omdat GGD het te druk heeft om bron- en contactonderzoek te doen. Ik zou het handig vinden als bij de positieve uitslag automatisch een sleutel + uitleg voor invoer in de app gegeven wordt. Het is nu erg omslachtig, en daar zit je niet op te wachten als je in quarantaine moet en veel moet regelen (of te ziek bent, wat wij gelukkig niet zijn geweest). Inmiddels hier volledig klachtenvrij, maar de app niet kunnen inzetten om anderen te beschermen.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 11:12:48__

> Valt vaak (1× pd) uit.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 14:01:27__

> 6 januari een melding dat ik €een kwartier of langer in de buurt ben geweest bij iemand bij wie corona zou zijn vastgesteld. Naar mijn mening onmogelijk omdat ik alleen 1 uur buitenshuis ben geweest voor een wandeling naar de apotheek. Wel mensen gepasseerd maar afstand gehouden en geen kwartier bij iemand in de nabijheid geweest. Zou denken dat het bluetooth verbinding met één van de buren moet zijn geweest. Heb er wel begrip voor dat het onmogelijk is om een onfeilbaar systeem te maken.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 22:20:45__

> Ik ben positief getest. In overleg met de ggd de sleutel van mijn app door gegeven. Nu kregen diverse mensen in mijn omgeving een melding. Al deze mensen zijn ruim korter dan 15 minuten in mijn omgeving geweest. En de afstand was ruim meer dan 1.5 meter. Sterker nog, 1 persoon is op minimaal 3 meter afstand van mij geweest. Mijn eigen vrouw kreeg trouwens geen melding..... Iedereen is negatief getest. Paniek om niets. Ik heb de app nu gedelete.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 22:13:42__

> Hoi, Ik heb de app vanaf 't begin en 1x de melding 1week te laat gehad(telefoon op werk in kluisje op 12 dec half uur binnen 1,5m van collega geweest)en melding gehad op 19 dec! Nu is mijn man positief getest (samen in quarantaine)en zie ik toevallig de melding nadat ik de app ge-opend heb(dus niet bij notificaties) dat ik op 7 januari bij hem in de buurt ben geweest terwijl hij 5 januari positief getest is en onze telefoons altijd naast elkaar aan de oplader liggen.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 21:47:01__

> Natuurlijk was de afstand klein, maar tussen mij en mijn buren zit nog altijd een dikke muur. Beetje jammer dat ik daardoor thuis zit nu.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:36:20__

> Meerdere keren langere tijd bij iemand in de buurt geweest die later positief is getest, geen melding ontvangen. Hoe kan dat? Geen idee of ze een sleutel hebben gekregen. Maar het valt me op dat dat nu al bij 2 mensen zo is gegaan. Dringt de GGD wel aan op het gebruik van de app? En vragen zij wel actief naar de sleutel??<br> :date: __2021-01-05 21:14:00__

> 2 x een melding gekregen, maar allebei de keren pas na 10 dagen na het contact. 🤔<br> :date: __2021-01-04 07:36:51__

> Vrouw positief, test 1 januari. Uitslag avond 2 januari, vandaag gebeld door GGD. (3 januari) we zijn uren verder en ik heb nog geen melding terwijl we in het zelfde huis zitten. Edit: de stappen zijn allemaal met de medewerker doorlopen dus zou moeten werken. Zelf vandaag instellingen veranderd op telefoon van mijn vrouw die met batterij besparingsmodus te maken hadden. Wat later kwam alsnog de melding binnen. De tijd tussen positief testen en melding vind ik persoonlijk te lang<br> :date: __2021-01-03 16:40:02__

> Praktijk "Ontwerp fout" met meldingen. In theorie werkt het maar niet in de praktijk. Als je de app melding niet ziet in de berichten stroom dan kom je 20 dagen later erachter bij het openen van de app dat er een melding is. Snel aanpakken dit, namelijk dat de melding vaker komt of niet zo makkelijk weggedrukt kan worden !!! Ik had dit ook gemaild 10 dagen geleden maar geen enkele reactie gehad. Blijkbaar is daar wel vakantie. Helaas heeft Corona geen kerstvakantie.... 03-01-2021 Volgens reactie worden alle mails beantwoord. Dit klopt niet, geen reactie gehad op de mail helaas. Waarom adviseert de overheid om de app elke dag te openen? Dat is toch geen gebruikersvriendelijke methode? (dit word zelfs als advies gegeven in reactie op een review. (schermafdruk op te vragen).<br> :date: __2021-01-03 16:10:20__

> Het best is natuurlijk dat je geen bericht krijgt via de app, maar die stilte geeft dan ook geen inzicht of die überhaupt wel werkt: laat in overzicht/kaartje meldingen zien van dag, week en maand, hierdoor krijg je allerlei bruikbare inzichten!<br> :date: __2021-01-09 11:19:05__

> Ik krijg iedere morgen de melding dat de app 24 uur niet heeft gewerkt wat moet ik hier aan doen?<br> :date: __2021-01-09 09:22:59__

> Zeker een voorstander van zo'n soort app. Helaas is er bij het ontwikkelen totaal niet goed nagedacht over de veilige werking. Onbegrijpelijk dat men niet in staat is om een goed doordachte app te ontwikkelen. In de praktijk ervaren dat het niet sluitend werkt. Het kost een vermogen en het verbaasd me dan ook dat deze app in de basis situatie te laat melding geeft zodat de besmettingsbron al met meerdere mensen in aanraking kan zijn geweest.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 23:41:23__

> Aan deze app heb je dus 3x NIKS. Staat al weken geïnstalleerd op mijn telefoon maar doet geen k*t en het enige wat ie wél doet is je batterij als een malle leeg trekken. Je moet het echt weer aan de overheid over laten om iets op de markt brengen wat 0,0 bij draagt aan een oplossing, dáár zijn ze goed in.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 21:57:34__

> 06-01-2021: Nog steeds negeren jullie false-positive meldingen. Ik moet bekennen dat ik steeds minder geloof dat deze app een positieve bijdrage levert. Uit nieuwsbronnen blijkt dat er dagelijks meer dan 10.000 contactmeldingen gegeven worden (NOS 29/10). Maar op 30 dec waren er in totaal maar 6400 positieve tests (NRC 30/12). Dat betekent dat het overgrote merendeel van de meldingen vals is geweest :-( 30-12-2020: het valt me op dat er best veel false-positives gemeld worden waar jullie niet op in gaan. Is dat bewust? 27-12-2020: Op 24dec kreeg ik een melding dat ik de dag ervoor (23dec) in de buurt van iemand met corona ben geweest. Echter de 23e heb ik de hele dag thuisgewerkt en alleen 's avonds even kort naar een supermarkt waar ik zeker niet 15 minuten lang dichtbij iemand ben geweest.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 11:51:29__

> Opkankeren<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:58:45__

> App blijft direct crashen na update. Heb een melding gekregen dat ik blootgesteld ben maar kan dit dus niet zien.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 07:44:39__

> 🕊️<br> :date: __2021-01-07 17:19:01__

> Heb de app al sinds het begin, maar kwam er gisteren per toeval achter dat de Bluetooth aperatuur van mijn buren met mijn telefoon willen communiceren. Zelfs als ik aan de andere kant in mijn woning ga staan. Dit is niet de bedoeling. Verwijder de app weer.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:48:54__

### Description
> Met deze app verzamelen we gegevens van Nederlanders voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar het bestrijden van het coronavirus (COVID-19). We willen beter kunnen gaan voorspellen welke zorgbehoefte er in Nederland straks is: hoeveel corona-patiënten verwachten we waar en wanneer? 
<br>Dit is een app van het Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC). Alle gegevens worden anoniem verwerkt. De geanonimiseerde gegevens worden veilig opgeslagen in Nederland. Lees hierover meer in de disclaimer. 
<br>In Nederland testen we beperkt of mensen het coronavirus hebben. We testen iemand alleen als hij/zij symptomen heeft en tot een kwetsbare doelgroep behoort. Hierdoor weten we niet precies hoeveel mensen in Nederland besmet zijn met het virus. 
<br>Door van zoveel mogelijk mensen in Nederland gegevens te verzamelen, kunnen we onderzoeken hoeveel mensen het coronavirus hebben (gehad) en waar zij in Nederland verblijven.
<br>Met deze gegevens proberen we de toekomstige zorgvraag te voorspellen: hoeveel coronapatiënten verwachten we waar en wanneer? 
<br>Uw bijdrage aan dit onderzoek is erg belangrijk om de behoefte aan zorg te kunnen voorspellen. 
<br>Help mee! Samen tegen het coronavirus in Nederland!
<br>Deze app is een initiatief van het Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC), gesteund door het Landelijk Netwerk Acute Zorg (LNAZ).
<br>Installeer de app en deel regelmatig gegevens over uw fysieke gesteldheid en die van uw huisgenoten voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Stimuleer familie, vrienden, kennissen en collega’s om hetzelfde te doen. Samen tegen het coronavirus in Nederland!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | LUMC Leiden |
| **Website**  | [https://www.lumc.nl](https://www.lumc.nl) |
| **Email** | covidradar@lumc.nl |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Men zou ook Griep- en Covid19-VACCinnaties-met xxx moeten kunnen registreren, later eventuele bijwerkingen Als men last van HooiKoorts of andere onderliggendeZiektes heeft, kan men wel Zelf beoordelen of iets al-of-niet toch een Covid-19Symptoom is.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:53:58__

> Vind het een interessante app met wetenschappelijk onderzoek die op deze manier in kaart brengt wie het grootste risico loopt en waar de uitbraak het grootste is . Vind deze manier van onderzoek beter dan de los vaste gedwarrel van tegenstrijdigheden van OMT /RIVM . Ben afhankelijk van behandeling bij een gespecialiseerde GGz instelling dus zit niet te wachten op nogmaals sluiting van een zorgverlenende instelling .<br> :date: __2020-08-13 11:16:59__

> Zinvol. Helpt ons allemaal<br> :date: __2020-05-20 12:49:53__

> Het lijkt me nuttig als je een opmerking kunt plaatsen. Ik heb nl hooikoorts en vul dus klachten in die daarbij horen, wat een verkeerde indruk kan geven.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 21:17:49__

> Goed! Dank hiervoor! Vraagje: bij het aangeven hoeveel tijd iemand buiten het huis is geweest, is de schaal alleen in uren en niet in andere tijdseenheden. Wordt dit in de toekomst nog aangepast of bestaat hiervoor geen relevantie?<br> :date: __2020-05-01 08:34:30__

> Laatste vraag over hoeveel mensen er te dicht bij kwamen invullen lukr niet altijd daar de versturen balk ervoor zit en een antwoord blokkeert.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 15:25:04__

> Sommige schuiven zijn nogal aanraakgevoelig, geeft onbedoeld verkeerde waarden. Sinds de laatste update valt de Versturen knop over de laatste schuif heen en is niet meer bereikbaar.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 21:18:13__

> Laatste vraag kan niet worden ingevuld, het veld "Versturen" staat ervoor en dus in de weg. Verder een onzinnige vraag over 5 meter afstand. Als je alleen al aan het fietsen bent, komt iedereen die je tegenkomt binnen die 5 meter....<br> :date: __2020-04-24 08:12:08__

> Vanaf nu meerdere keren voor ons gezin ingevuld. Zeer lastig met zoon op voorgezet onderwijs die met meer dan 1000 over de gangen lopen. Tevens werkt het met het "schuifsysteem" erg lastig, als je naar de volgende persoon swipt kunnen er zo maar 39 staan die thuis op bezoek zijn gekomen!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 10:45:41__

> Kleinkinderen jonger dan 12 jaar komen 2 x per week op bezoek. Afstand houden 1 1/2m ondoenlijk. Nauwelijks risico. Kan een vertekend beeld geven.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 20:49:05__

> Goed idee maar ik mis de vraag :valt u onder de risico groep? Hoesten en keelpijn bv kan ook iets anders dan civid zijn. Long patiënten, allergie bv En met kinderen kunnen we soepeler omgaan. Geen 1,5m afstand bv Dus, de vraag bent u in contact geweest met kinderen buiten het gezin?<br> :date: __2020-08-15 12:53:41__

> Het lukt na de versoepelingen van de lockdown niet meer om de waarden in te vullen. Hoeveel mensen binnen 1.5 of 5(!) meter zijn gekomen in de supermarkt of in de stad? Geen idee!<br> :date: __2020-06-25 20:55:45__

> De vraag hoeveel mensen binnen 5 meter kwamen is niet te beantwoorden als je dagelijks een wandeling in het park maakt. 5 of 50? Ik stop ermee<br> :date: __2020-06-20 20:29:35__

> Meerdere gebruikers schreven het al : de schuifbalken zijn veel te gevoelig waardoor onbedoeld hoge waarden worden doorgegeven. Gebeurt vooral bij scrollen. Bijvoorbeeld 15 bezoekers gehad terwijl dit eigenlijk 0 had moeten zijn. Mijn inziens worden de uitkomsten dus onbetrouwbaar. Kijk het nog weekje aan, anders stop ik.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 15:13:12__

> Leek een aardige app. Kap ermee want de 5m regel is niet uitvoerbaar<br> :date: __2020-04-25 19:37:29__

> goed idee, alleen jammer dat je gelijk 'besmet' ben als je op een vraag ja antwoord, variabelen zoals hooikoorts worden niet meegenomen althans niet toen ik er mee startte, app dus verwijderd!<br> :date: __2020-04-25 17:44:07__

> Sinds laatste update zitten de navigatie knoppen over de velden in de laatste vraag te beantwoorden.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 20:54:20__

> Na de wijziging in de vraagstelling kan ik de laatste vraag niet meer beantwoorden omdat de knop 'versturen' er overheen ligt. Verder werkt het prima.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 07:21:18__

> Beetje onduidelijk dat "persoon" ikzelf ben en je die geen keuzenaam kan geven. Kreeg na installatie geen vragen over "persoon" tot ik partner ging invoeren en daar vragen zag. Opnieuw geīnstalleerd maar. De vraag over 5meter afstsnd doet wat willekeurig aan waar we het standaard hebben over 1,5. Binnen ov en bij passerende sporters kan ik me wel 3m of 5m vragen voorstellen. Niet bij griepige reizigers of hooikoorts-ers.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:09:32__

> Schuifknoppen zijn nauwelijks goed te zetten, app is niet anders te sluiten dan geforceerd, als men klaar is en verder wil gaan.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 09:28:20__

> Ik stop er mee. Puur omdat je gewoon bij het dagelijks invullen, nog steeds dagelijks de vraag krijgt of de gegevens nog kloppen en het belangrijk is iedere dag in te vullen<br> :date: __2020-07-09 20:12:11__

> Ik ben gestopt met invullen omdat het onmogelijk is om aan te geven hoeveel mensen binnen een straal van vijf meter zijn gekomen. De makers van de app hebben kennelijk weinig ervaring met de realiteit van het leven.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 10:22:15__

> Ik vind het heel goed dat de informatie verzameld wordt en heb tot aan vandaag meegedaan voor mij en ook voor mijn man. Ik stop er nu mee omdat het onmogelijk is in te vullen hoeveel mensen binnen een straal van 5 meter komen.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 20:57:31__

> App blijft hangen. Als ik na het beantwoorden van de vragen op versturen gedrukt heb, blijft de app aangeven dat er een nieuw bericht is.<br> :date: __2020-04-25 21:46:39__

> Hele rare nieuwe vraag: hoeveel mensen kwamen binnen 5 meter. Daar weet ik echt het antwoord niet op, die vallen buiten mijn aandacht. Die mensen op de fiets, die passeren, in de supermarkt, aan de overkant van de straat. Die tel ik niet. Zal gauw meer dan 20 zijn<br> :date: __2020-04-25 08:20:27__

> Achterliggende chronische aandoeningen worden niet meegenomen. Zou 1 alg. vraag kunnen zijn. 2. Zou thuis niet beter veranderd kunnen worden in: binnen uw erfgrens?<br> :date: __2020-04-08 09:28:40__

> Eens met vorige reviews. Zelf heb ik last van hooikoorts. Telkens bij een niesbui, vol lopen van neus, rillerigheid ga ik bij mezelf te raden of het een bekend allergie symptoom is. Misschien hooikoorts ook meenemen in app en combineren met de polleninformatie.<br> :date: __2020-04-08 08:40:21__

Geen handige app. Vooral het invullen van getallen met die schuiven. Vooral de laatste schuif, die zit heel dicht tegen de knop versturen aan. Waarom niet gewoon cijfers ingeven?

### Description
> COVapp gives you the opportunity to participate in the scientific research into COVID-19. When you have created an account (emailaddres and phonenumber for 2-step verification login), you can login and use the app. The app doesn't collect any personal information. You can fill in a daily diary (list of symptoms) and see information about the virus and see FAQ about it. When you start, you have to give your consent, else you can't fill in the daily diary and the app doesn't collect this data. The app does not collect any other data from your device, other then the you manually enter (symtpoms).


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Your Research |
| **Website**  | [https://researchfollowapp.com/CORONAthuis/instructies](https://researchfollowapp.com/CORONAthuis/instructies) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
