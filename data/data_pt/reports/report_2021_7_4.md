# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Caros informáticos... pessoalmente gostava mais da APP antiga ou seja a anterior a esta. Possivelmente esta seja mais rápida, mais técnica, não sei, só sei que a antiga a meu ver era mais intuitiva. Convém dizer que faz o que é pretendido mas estruturalmente acho a outra melhor, mais simples. Terei que me adaptar lógico mas é a minha opinião em relação á alteração. Cumprimentos P.S- o cartão ADSE não aparece? Algum defeito na APP?! É possível resolver a questão do cartão ADSE?<br> :date: __2021-06-30 22:43:22__

> Quero saber o boletim de vacinas do meu filho que não tem número de telemóvel ainda. Não consigo. Não aceita o meu número nem o da mãe, porque já estão registados. Não aceita 0000 porque não é possível. E agora?<br> :date: __2021-06-27 16:01:05__

> Ajustes necessários! A app é feia visualmente e praticamente. Não encontrei forma de iniciar secção na app. As apps MySNS Carteira e MySNS Tempos pode muito bem ser integrado a app MySNS o que faria uma maior simplicidade e unifornidade. Enfim certas apps do governo podiam ser mais simples, uniformes e fáceis de usar, ou seja, TODAS AS APPS RELACIONADAS AO SNS NO RAIO DE UMA APP SÓ, É ASSIM TÃO DIFÍCIL DE IMAGINAR???<br> :date: __2021-06-26 04:09:10__

### Description
> A OpenWHO é a plataforma interativa de transferência de conhecimento da Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) que oferece cursos online para melhorar a resposta a emergências em saúde. A OpenWHO permite que a Organização e os seus principais parceiros transfiram conhecimento capaz de salvar vidas às equipas de resposta na linha da frente.
<br>Com a OpenWHO, terá a flexibilidade de aprender ao seu próprio ritmo. Assista a curtas palestras em vídeo e teste o seu conhecimento através de autotestes quando e onde quiser. O fórum do curso e o espaço de colaboração permite-lhe comunicar com outros participantes e especialistas em todo o mundo.
<br>Concebido sobretudo para profissionais de saúde, equipas de resposta na linha da frente e decisores, a app é também uma fonte de informação para aqueles afetados por surtos de doenças e emergências em saúde, ou para aqueles com interesse geral no trabalho da OMS em emergências em saúde. 
<br>A aplicação possui 6 canais: 
<br>- canal Epidemias aborda a gestão de doenças infeciosas e fornece informação científica capaz de salvar vidas.
<br>- canal Pronto para responder ajuda a  preparar o pessoal que se encontra em formação para trabalhar em surtos de doenças e emergências sanitárias.
<br>- canal Social foca-se nas intervenções com base nas ciências sociais e ajuda na comunicação com comunidades afetadas.  
<br>- canal Preparação para Pandemias reúne cursos sobre vários aspetos da preparação, incluindo vigilância, medidas de saúde pública e comunicação de risco durante uma pandemia. 
<br>- canal COVID-19 fornece recursos de aprendizagem nas 6 línguas oficiais da OMS (árabe, chinês, espanhol, francês, inglês e russo) para profissionais de saúde, decisores e o público em geral sobre o surto da doença do coronavírus (COVID-19). 
<br>- canal de COVID-19 Idiomas Nacionais fornece os mesmos recursos de aprendizagem que o canal COVID-19, mas em idiomas nacionais, tais como Indonésio, Japonês e Português. 
<br>Os cursos da OpenWHO estão disponíveis em diversas línguas, incluindo as 6 línguas oficiais da OMS. 
<br>Faça o download da app e junte-se à comunidade da OpenWHO.
<br>Esta app é desenvolvida em cooperação entre o Instituto Hasso Plattner e a OMS. O conteúdo de aprendizagem é fornecido exclusivamente pela OMS.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> STAYAWAY COVID é a aplicação oficial de notificação de exposição à COVID-19 em Portugal. É uma aplicação para telemóveis que tem como objetivo auxiliar o país no rastreio da COVID-19. A aplicação permite, de forma simples e segura, que cada um de nós seja informado sobre exposições de risco à doença, através da monitorização de contactos recentes. A aplicação é de utilização voluntária e gratuita e, em momento algum, tem acesso à sua identidade ou dados pessoais.
<br>Uma vez instalada a aplicação, o telemóvel anuncia a sua presença a todos os dispositivos próximos usando identificadores aleatórios que não revelam identidades pessoais. A informação partilhada entre dispositivos permite à STAYAWAY COVID saber de que telemóveis esteve perto, quão perto e por quanto tempo. A Organização Mundial de Saúde sugere que, contactos a menos de 2 metros e por mais de 15 minutos com alguém portador de COVID-19 sejam considerados com elevado risco de contágio.
<br>1. Ausência de registo de elevado risco de contágio
<br>Não registando contactos de proximidade com elevado risco de contágio com alguém a quem foi diagnosticada COVID-19, a aplicação informa-nos exatamente disso com a data da última avaliação.
<br>2. Alerta de elevado risco de contágio
<br>Se alguém de quem estivemos perigosamente próximo nos últimos 14 dias for diagnosticado com COVID-19 e informar o sistema STAYAWAY COVID, a aplicação alerta-nos de imediato do risco sugerindo que nos isolemos e contactemos a Linha SNS 24 (808 24 24 24).
<br>3. Após diagnóstico de COVID-19
<br>No caso de contrairmos COVID-19, com o diagnóstico receberemos um código numérico que nos permitirá, anonimamente e através da aplicação, informar o sistema STAYAWAY COVID. É este ato que permite ao sistema alertar segura e atempadamente todos aqueles que podemos ter contagiado, mesmo antes de terem tido qualquer sintoma. Não é nunca revelada a ninguém a identidade de ninguém.
<br>A aplicação STAYAWAY COVID foi desenvolvida pelo INESC TEC, ISPUP, Keyruptive e Ubirider para a DGS / Ministério da Saúde.

| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Mas fiquei particularmente chocado com um dos casos que vi aqui nos comentários. A pessoa em causa tentou por tudo que lhe dessem os códigos e não houve NINGUÉM que lhos entregasse. Aqui o caso é mesmo muito grave, e a todas as entidades responsáveis que n os entregam deviam era de ter vergonha e dou -1000000 estrelas<br> :date: __2021-06-26 11:56:45__
