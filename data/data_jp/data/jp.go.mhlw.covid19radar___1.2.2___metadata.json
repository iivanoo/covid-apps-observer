    "description": "This app is for use in Japan.\r\nOfficially provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW), this app notifies you of close contact with COVID-19 positive users to help the government and healthcare organizations contain the spread of COVID-19. \r\nThe functions and design of this app are planned to be updated. Please install the latest version that MHLW will announce on their website. \r\n\r\n\u25a0 What you can do \r\nThe app recognizes close contacts (within 1 meter, 15 minutes or more) between smartphones running this app. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can register anonymously in this app. If you have been in close contact with a user who tested positive, the app notifies you of potential infection and provides guidance to protect your health. \r\n\r\n\u25a0 Privacy \r\nNo personal information such as your name or phone number is collected. No geolocation data including GPS data is collected. \r\nAll data is encrypted and saved locally on your smartphone. All data is automatically deleted after 14 days.

Received codes are stored only on the devices. \r\n\r\n\u25a0 Close contact notifications \r\nUsers who tested COVID-19 positive, can choose to share the random codes that their devices have sent out. Each device periodically checks if it has previously encountered any of the shared codes. If the code shared by a COVID-19 positive user matches with a code stored on your device, you will be notified that you have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive user and provides guidance to protect your health. \r\nTo receive notifications of close contact with COVID-19 positive users, you need to download this app and enable exposure notification function on OS settings. The app only works with others who have the official app installed. \r\n\r\n\u25a0 Guidance to protect your health \r\nIn the app, you can also check the list of dates you were in close contact with COVID-19 positive users during the last 14 days. If you have more than one close contact, please use the symptom checker provided in the app to receive appropriate guidance such as contact information of healthcare organizations.
