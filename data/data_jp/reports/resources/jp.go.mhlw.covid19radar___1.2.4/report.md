### Description
> This app is for use in Japan.
<br>Officially provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW), this app notifies you of close contact with COVID-19 positive users to help the government and healthcare organizations contain the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>■ What you can do 
<br>The app recognizes close contacts (within 1 meter, 15 minutes or more) between smartphones running this app. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can register anonymously in this app. If you have been in close contact with a user who tested positive, the app notifies you of potential infection and provides guidance to protect your health. 
<br>■ Privacy 
<br>No personal information such as your name or phone number is collected. No geolocation data including GPS data is collected. 
<br>All data is encrypted and saved locally on your smartphone. All data is automatically deleted after 14 days. Your movements cannot be seen in any way by anyone including government agencies or third parties. 
<br>You can stop recording close contacts anytime. Turn on recording the settings in the app or delete the app. 
<br>■ Recording ‘close contact’ 
<br>This app records ‘close contact’ across Android and iOS devices by using Bluetooth and Exposure Notification API provided by Google/Apple. 
<br>When you run this app, each smartphone generates a random code. This code changes every 10-20 minutes 
<br>When smartphones running this app are in close contact, they exchange random codes. Received codes are stored only on the devices. 
<br>■ Close contact notifications 
<br>Users who tested COVID-19 positive, can choose to share the random codes that their devices have sent out. Each device periodically checks if it has previously encountered any of the shared codes. If the code shared by a COVID-19 positive user matches with a code stored on your device, you will be notified that you have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive user and provides guidance to protect your health. 
<br>To receive notifications of close contact with COVID-19 positive users, you need to download this app and enable exposure notification function on OS settings. The app only works with others who have the official app installed. 
<br>■ Guidance to protect your health 
<br>In the app, you can also check the list of dates you were in close contact with COVID-19 positive users during the last 14 days. If you have more than one close contact, please use the symptom checker provided in the app to receive appropriate guidance such as contact information of healthcare organizations. Depending on the symptoms, you will be advised to take a COVID-19 test. You will also find instructions if you want to reach out healthcare organizations by phone. 
<br>■ When you tested positive 
<br>When you are tested COVID-19 positive, please voluntarily register so in the app to notify other users of potential infection. When healthcare organization registers your positive test results to “The Health Center Real-time Information-sharing System on COVID-19” (known as HER-SYS) provided by MHLW,  a processing number is issued to you. Entering this processing number in the app will allow you to register your positive test result. 
<br>■ Stop or delete close contact recording 
<br>You can stop recording close contacts with other users anytime by changing app settings. You can delete close contact history (14 days) anytime by deleting the app. 
<br>■ Availability 
<br>This application will be available until COVID-19 ends. 
<br>■ Supported OS versions 
<br>Android 6.0 or higher

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-05-04 08:04:28__

> It works only in Japan. So don't give one star without reading it's terms and conditions.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 16:05:37__

> The app isn't working out of Japan! So guys with 1 star, if you have problems with terms&conditions and no Internet before you arrived in Japan, don't worries when you arrive in Japan it will be fine, maximum you may need to buy jp sim in airport.🙃<br> :date: __2021-03-27 06:00:12__

> オープンソースで開発されていると何度言っても聞く耳を持たずにとにかく批判したいバカばっかりですが。 シンプルで無駄な機能もないいいアプリ、ただし必要性は皆無。 追記 開始日付の表示のバグは治ってませんが関係なく動作しているんじゃないですかね。それだけでもし接触したのに通知が来なければ、その責任はGoogleとAppleにあるんじゃないですか。API自体の不具合を政府やアプリ開発者に言っても無駄。<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:09:37__

> If everyone used this responsibly we'd all be a lot safer. Please download it.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:50:40__

> Why i cant open the apps? I already install it, the permission wont go<br> :date: __2020-11-30 03:06:26__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-20 14:17:29__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-18 06:16:36__

> Great!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 06:04:42__

> Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).<br> :date: __2020-10-27 17:49:59__

> Feel secure.. ty<br> :date: __2021-01-05 13:13:55__

> Easy to use, no ads, simple design Would be perfectl if everyone used it/self report their symptoms. So far, I don't know if it helps or not<br> :date: __2020-10-07 17:04:52__

> Easy to install. Nicely bilingual. Weekly(?) reminders it is running are a nice touch.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 08:32:45__

> This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:56:29__

> 別アプリで、このアプリの利用者位置人数を計測できたのですが、意外とたくさんいた。病院保育園銀行は異常におおい。心配なんだね。いろいろ欠点もありますが、ないよりましです。危惧されたバッテリーいっぱい減るんじゃないか問題はそんなんでもなかった。<br> :date: __2020-07-03 03:19:56__

> Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 23:45:33__

> I was getting connection error at the T&C page while I was outside of Japan but once in Japan the app worked fine on my pixel 4a 5g android 11<br> :date: __2021-04-24 21:39:19__

> Not sure if it's working or not so I can't honestly rate after hearing it doesn't work for months<br> :date: __2021-04-22 07:22:11__

> It is so good.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 18:55:37__

> No one in Japan practices social distancing, even on trains people dont wear masks. This app seems like a waste of time unless people change their habits.<br> :date: __2020-07-22 01:25:50__

> 英語学習のために、スマートフォンの言語設定を英語にしています。このアプリで は端末の言語設定がそのまま反映されるので、アプリの言語は自動的に英語になります。 感染者と接触があった場合に、保健所などに画面を提示する必要が出てくる場合があるようですが、英語設定のままでも対応してもらえるのでしょうか？ 日本語でないといけないようであれば、アプリ内で簡単に言語設定を変えられるように仕様変更していただけるといいと思います。<br> :date: __2020-07-08 09:46:08__

> 100 MB download is a lot!<br> :date: __2020-07-06 14:33:54__

> 問題なくインストールでき、個人情報を登録せず利用開始できました。 機能についてもっと長く使わないと分かりませんが、今までの気づきをまず共有します。 1. ステム言語が英語の場合アプリの表示も英語に変わります。 2. 機能的に問題ないですが、厚生労働省のメイン画面のバナーには英語の...welfareのeが欠けています。 3. 友人にシェアボタンでアプリをLINEで送って見ましたが、Androidアプリなのでplayストアになりますね。友人がiphoneなので、役に立たないリンクでした。アクセスするスマホによって、自動的にアップストアやplayストアにつながるといいと思います。 以上によって総合的にまず3つ星にしました。<br> :date: __2020-06-20 03:38:56__
