# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

### Description
> This app is for use in Japan.
<br>Officially provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW), this app notifies you of close contact with COVID-19 positive users to help the government and healthcare organizations contain the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>■ What you can do 
<br>The app recognizes close contacts (within 1 meter, 15 minutes or more) between smartphones running this app. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can register anonymously in this app. If you have been in close contact with a user who tested positive, the app notifies you of potential infection and provides guidance to protect your health. 
<br>■ Privacy 
<br>No personal information such as your name or phone number is collected. No geolocation data including GPS data is collected. 
<br>All data is encrypted and saved locally on your smartphone. All data is automatically deleted after 14 days. Your movements cannot be seen in any way by anyone including government agencies or third parties. 
<br>You can stop recording close contacts anytime. Turn on recording the settings in the app or delete the app. 
<br>■ Recording ‘close contact’ 
<br>This app records ‘close contact’ across Android and iOS devices by using Bluetooth and Exposure Notification API provided by Google/Apple. 
<br>When you run this app, each smartphone generates a random code. This code changes every 10-20 minutes 
<br>When smartphones running this app are in close contact, they exchange random codes. Received codes are stored only on the devices. 
<br>■ Close contact notifications 
<br>Users who tested COVID-19 positive, can choose to share the random codes that their devices have sent out. Each device periodically checks if it has previously encountered any of the shared codes. If the code shared by a COVID-19 positive user matches with a code stored on your device, you will be notified that you have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive user and provides guidance to protect your health. 
<br>To receive notifications of close contact with COVID-19 positive users, you need to download this app and enable exposure notification function on OS settings. The app only works with others who have the official app installed. 
<br>■ Guidance to protect your health 
<br>In the app, you can also check the list of dates you were in close contact with COVID-19 positive users during the last 14 days. If you have more than one close contact, please use the symptom checker provided in the app to receive appropriate guidance such as contact information of healthcare organizations. Depending on the symptoms, you will be advised to take a COVID-19 test. You will also find instructions if you want to reach out healthcare organizations by phone. 
<br>■ When you tested positive 
<br>When you are tested COVID-19 positive, please voluntarily register so in the app to notify other users of potential infection. When healthcare organization registers your positive test results to “The Health Center Real-time Information-sharing System on COVID-19” (known as HER-SYS) provided by MHLW,  a processing number is issued to you. Entering this processing number in the app will allow you to register your positive test result. 
<br>■ Stop or delete close contact recording 
<br>You can stop recording close contacts with other users anytime by changing app settings. You can delete close contact history (14 days) anytime by deleting the app. 
<br>■ Availability 
<br>This application will be available until COVID-19 ends. 
<br>■ Supported OS versions 
<br>Android 6.0 or higher

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | 厚生労働省健康局 |
| **Website**  | [https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/cocoa_00138.html](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/cocoa_00138.html) |
| **Email** | appsupport@cov19.mhlw.go.jp |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=%E5%8E%9A%E7%94%9F%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E7%9C%81%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E5%B1%80](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=%E5%8E%9A%E7%94%9F%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E7%9C%81%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E5%B1%80) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-05-04 08:04:28__

> It works only in Japan. So don't give one star without reading it's terms and conditions.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 16:05:37__

> The app isn't working out of Japan! So guys with 1 star, if you have problems with terms&conditions and no Internet before you arrived in Japan, don't worries when you arrive in Japan it will be fine, maximum you may need to buy jp sim in airport.🙃<br> :date: __2021-03-27 06:00:12__

> オープンソースで開発されていると何度言っても聞く耳を持たずにとにかく批判したいバカばっかりですが。 シンプルで無駄な機能もないいいアプリ、ただし必要性は皆無。 追記 開始日付の表示のバグは治ってませんが関係なく動作しているんじゃないですかね。それだけでもし接触したのに通知が来なければ、その責任はGoogleとAppleにあるんじゃないですか。API自体の不具合を政府やアプリ開発者に言っても無駄。<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:09:37__

> If everyone used this responsibly we'd all be a lot safer. Please download it.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:50:40__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-18 06:16:36__

> Great!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 06:04:42__

> Works very well, took a second to install, didn't ask for any info, just gets on with it. Note that you only get anything out of it if it detects that you were close to someone who had the virus for at least 15 minutes. As hardly anyone has it in Japan, you likely won't get many hits, maybe none, at the moment at least (Essentially because preemptive efforts like this are working).<br> :date: __2020-10-27 17:49:59__

> Easy to use, no ads, simple design Would be perfectl if everyone used it/self report their symptoms. So far, I don't know if it helps or not<br> :date: __2020-10-07 17:04:52__

> Easy to install. Nicely bilingual. Weekly(?) reminders it is running are a nice touch.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 08:32:45__

> This is the kind of app that you wish doesn't say anything. That said, the app works fine and all, but it should also help improve a user's peace of mind by allowing the user to test exposure with other consenting users. And it's in English and the Japanese authoruties do take their time to ensure that the exposure system is followed through. This makes it even better than some ancient methods like GPS & check-in.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:56:29__

> 別アプリで、このアプリの利用者位置人数を計測できたのですが、意外とたくさんいた。病院保育園銀行は異常におおい。心配なんだね。いろいろ欠点もありますが、ないよりましです。危惧されたバッテリーいっぱい減るんじゃないか問題はそんなんでもなかった。<br> :date: __2020-07-03 03:19:56__

> Easy install. I always have Bluetooth off unless connected to headphones, so breaking that habit will be difficult. This doesn't work unless Bluetooth is on. Anyone with privacy concerns, none here, but I hope you have turned of GPS location tracking. I'm not sure those people who are concerned about privacy are even aware their location data is being tracked and stored. See Google Maps TimeLine, which I use. Personally I would favor a more aggressive contact tracing app for the case of Corona.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 23:45:33__

> It is so good.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 18:55:37__

> No one in Japan practices social distancing, even on trains people dont wear masks. This app seems like a waste of time unless people change their habits.<br> :date: __2020-07-22 01:25:50__

> 英語学習のために、スマートフォンの言語設定を英語にしています。このアプリで は端末の言語設定がそのまま反映されるので、アプリの言語は自動的に英語になります。 感染者と接触があった場合に、保健所などに画面を提示する必要が出てくる場合があるようですが、英語設定のままでも対応してもらえるのでしょうか？ 日本語でないといけないようであれば、アプリ内で簡単に言語設定を変えられるように仕様変更していただけるといいと思います。<br> :date: __2020-07-08 09:46:08__

> 100 MB download is a lot!<br> :date: __2020-07-06 14:33:54__

> 問題なくインストールでき、個人情報を登録せず利用開始できました。 機能についてもっと長く使わないと分かりませんが、今までの気づきをまず共有します。 1. ステム言語が英語の場合アプリの表示も英語に変わります。 2. 機能的に問題ないですが、厚生労働省のメイン画面のバナーには英語の...welfareのeが欠けています。 3. 友人にシェアボタンでアプリをLINEで送って見ましたが、Androidアプリなのでplayストアになりますね。友人がiphoneなので、役に立たないリンクでした。アクセスするスマホによって、自動的にアップストアやplayストアにつながるといいと思います。 以上によって総合的にまず3つ星にしました。<br> :date: __2020-06-20 03:38:56__
