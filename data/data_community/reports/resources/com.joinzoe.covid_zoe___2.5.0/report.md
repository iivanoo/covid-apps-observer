### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> You have to be very proactive to update the app. An embedded link would help.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 10:31:00__

> I've been asked to add my vaccine details but I can't fine where to add it? Surely this should be obvious to users? Any hints?<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:07:43__

> Easy to use. Provides valuable data in the fight against covid. Use it to speed you the battle to control this virus.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 13:28:03__

> Since the last update it doesn't remember my postcode<br> :date: __2021-06-05 11:46:13__

> After the latest update, I have to "update postcode" every time I open the app if I want see the number of cases in my area. Very annoying<br> :date: __2021-06-04 22:06:55__

> I had the Astra-Zenica vaccine, but there didn't appear in the list of options.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:33:11__

> good & quick. however, Zoe sent me an email today, asking me to log my vaccination on the app. I can find nowhere on the app which allows me to do this! So not so good.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 14:28:27__

> Easy to use. For reporting multiple people it would be good to flip immediately back to the list of people.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 14:22:46__

> Just okay<br> :date: __2021-06-05 19:52:15__

> Report jabs not working<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:48:44__

> The app seems to have signed me up twice and is now saying l haven't logged my vaccinations, which l have!<br> :date: __2021-06-03 14:32:12__

> Lost my information and have not been able to retrieve it<br> :date: __2021-05-30 17:54:00__

> Frustrated that ZOE has not found a way to let participants enter their vaccines from test centers.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 04:52:48__

> Ok app, does what it supposed to do<br> :date: __2021-05-25 16:59:28__

> Great app to support national lockd and r3se but doe snot always remind you to log and record<br> :date: __2021-05-15 22:37:27__

> Very good app that is easy to use . No problem with push notifications. Would have given 5 stars but for one problem. Example: I noticed when reporting this morning (14 May) that the app said that I hadn't reported for 3 days. This is incorrect and is not the first time that this has happened. There appears to be a problem here where data is not always collected, or has gone missing somehow.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 11:30:08__

> I'm close to giving up on this app. My second jab was done as part of a trial. The app does not want trial jabs to be recorded. So I have to lie every day and say I haven't had a second jab. I also had hay fever recently and was asked to take a Covid test. Hay fever is completely normal for me at this time of year. I will probably have it for a couple of months. I'm not taking dozens of Covid tests!<br> :date: __2021-05-12 01:39:30__

> It is a bit quirky ..needs some fine tuning to make it work better<br> :date: __2021-05-10 16:22:30__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me 2 days even to to 5. I've emailed, no reply. I've tried everything I can think of to get an answer. Am I wasting my time doing this?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:06:11__

> Not very helpful<br> :date: __2021-05-18 17:28:00__

> This app has suddenly started misbehaving. It says it is offline when it is not. Even after reinstalling it will not open- it crashes. Annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:01:50__

> I send daily details but still have up to 3 reminders. Only way of getting rid of notification is to repeat . This gives false reading .<br> :date: __2021-05-10 18:59:47__

> App keeps locking me out, saying cant identify me, also i cant stay logged in after i get help to log back in, then im back to square 1.. ive been logging since the beginning daily till the last few days, it needs sorting for me to continue.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 20:08:38__

> No longer very accurate<br> :date: __2021-04-20 07:41:19__

> Doesn't seem easy enough to use. Can't see it going "viral". (Scuse the pun).<br> :date: __2021-04-15 11:48:20__

> I was in this for over a. Year but your system through me out and I can no longer get into it and can't email anyone. Too baf<br> :date: __2021-04-14 17:41:53__

> This app worked really well, now for some reason, it won't let me log in. I've uninstall and reinstalled and changed my password, nothing has helped 🤷‍♀️<br> :date: __2021-04-13 13:17:59__

> Suddenly asking me to login each time and now not recognizing my account aftrr reinstalling.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 17:53:00__

> Oh dear it's really gone to pot. I constantly have to enter my postcode and now can't report as the added questionnaire won't let me past question 1 as I can't enter a 'No' Please sort this out.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 09:38:00__

> Has up to date info but I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing. Update 30th May, tried reinstalling app yet again and still unable to log vaccination so think I'll give up with it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:41:22__

> Was good, but recent data appears to be incorrect. The data being reported for my area of the country is wildly different from the government data and local health authority data. I have emailed about the discrepancies but have heard nothing back. Have uninstalled the App now as I don't trust the numbers.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 13:06:03__

> Not as good as the NHS one<br> :date: __2021-05-05 22:39:28__

> Annoying<br> :date: __2021-05-02 14:41:42__

> I haven't had any notifications for months, despite the app setting being switched on.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 12:47:37__

> Poor. Connection Difficult always to log in .<br> :date: __2021-04-09 12:28:45__

> I had this app a while ago, uninstalled it but forgot to review it. Fairly poor interface but also I'd question the value of the data gathered and how it can be of real value.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 03:02:39__

> Apparently I'm supposed to be able to log my vaccine on here. Still have not worked out how. Can ask other people log their vaccine, but no idea how to log my own. Very frustrating. I've checked I've got the latest version, I'm pretty tech savvy but still no idea. Given up.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 08:49:24__

> 547 MB of storage used!? This should be such a simple little app!<br> :date: __2021-04-04 15:00:35__
