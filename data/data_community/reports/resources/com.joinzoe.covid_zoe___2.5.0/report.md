### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app.educational and informative<br> :date: __2021-07-09 17:37:22__

> Good app easy to use, helps the fight against covid. Full of useful information. Still using it to log daily a year after installing. I would like to see a feature that allows you to log if you have been told to isolate due to contact with a positive case as is the current case for myself. I have no symptoms but currently isolating and taking tests but nowhere to log this.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 15:16:59__

> Easy to use app. Useful for reporting symptoms not thought to be typical, according to government information.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 14:05:39__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-09 12:54:48__

> Recommended - useful app.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 07:26:38__

> Makes me feel I'm helping<br> :date: __2021-07-09 03:06:09__

> In general app is OK but unable to add previous symptoms. When installed only basic information was required. There was not, and still isn't, a way of adding possible previous contracting the SARS-COV-2 COVID-19 virus which in my case was in January 2020.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 23:10:34__

> Had some hiccups when it wouldn't accept my normal standard answer. But hey, up and running when needed, so worth persevering. And the data is priceless<br> :date: __2021-07-09 18:41:36__

> I wanted to take part, but after 3 days its already forgotten all the info I already put in about my vaccine ans stuff. I can spare 1 minute but I can't be bothered to resubmit the same info over and over.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 06:05:19__

> Unable to update details after PCR.test<br> :date: __2021-07-07 15:31:52__

> Useful app, usability could be improved to reduce number of times I have to scroll to see the button I need to press. Instead of three screens I navigate every day, why not just have a single button to say no change from yesterday?<br> :date: __2021-07-05 11:37:45__

> Long questionnaire on eating, but worthwhile.<br> :date: __2021-06-29 18:36:19__

> A great thing to do to help research the epidemic. App itself is not that easy to use. I had to load it and try to sign in several times before I got going with it. First time I have up but then it came back to it.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 20:44:00__

> Great app, seem to be having issues recently with logging in, resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling hence 3*<br> :date: __2021-06-24 16:23:34__

> Fairly easy to use<br> :date: __2021-06-23 12:00:22__

> I did not receive the extra surveys for mental health and Long Covid no matter what I tried so it is not representative.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 22:10:01__

> Have used this app for a long time until now. Its been stuck for a few days since my 2nd jab. When asked about symptoms near injection site the next button goes grey and I can't move forward so no longer able to report.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 12:26:18__

> Please add a small script to this app so that if I have already logged my symptoms, the app doesn't send a notification to do it. It's intrusive and very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 12:08:59__

> I've had to re-load this app four times since I started. If I hadn't been so determined, I would have given up long ago. I have an Android phone. Other than that- great app guys. I hope that better statistical science will be the result of your efforts.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 12:23:07__

> The app stuck on a questionnaire about covid and covid symptoms of which I have none but I can't get out of it. If I close the app and reopen it is back at the questionnaire with no option to say I haven't had covid and I've not had any symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 14:56:18__

> This app has been fine up until now, but being asked to confirm, every day, that my vaccination info hasn't changed (I've had both, so why would it?) and my tests... its bad design and its getting very annoying. Just put a button so we can report changes if they happen? Its making me want to uninstall it. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-06-09 12:43:13__

> For goodness sake get the graph axis right... 8 June 2021.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 15:05:45__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me 2 days even to to 5. I've emailed, no reply. I've tried everything I can think of to get an answer. Am I wasting my time doing this?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:06:11__

> Not very helpful<br> :date: __2021-05-18 17:28:00__

> This app has suddenly started misbehaving. It says it is offline when it is not. Even after reinstalling it will not open- it crashes. Annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:01:50__

> I send daily details but still have up to 3 reminders. Only way of getting rid of notification is to repeat . This gives false reading .<br> :date: __2021-05-10 18:59:47__

> App keeps locking me out, saying cant identify me, also i cant stay logged in after i get help to log back in, then im back to square 1.. ive been logging since the beginning daily till the last few days, it needs sorting for me to continue.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 20:08:38__
