### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellent app. Very simple but with options to see more of the research if you want to. This is the closest to real-time info on infection rates across the UK and I trust it more than government figures. Great to do my bit to help scientists (and ordinary people) understand coronavirus.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 13:40:29__

> I had to reload the app and forgot my password and I never received a link to reset despite multiple attempts.Luckily I have another email address that I have used. I was logging for my husband who has had two tests due to surgery and it lost the dates. Otherwise a brilliant app and thank you for all your hard work<br> :date: __2020-12-05 13:28:58__

> Easy to use each day. Hopefully I'm helping their results.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 12:32:26__

> Although you're not inline with the NHS app, and your figures are showing fewer cases compared to the NHS app (not your fault), this is a well laid out, easy to use system. Thank you.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 11:20:15__

> Good to report symptoms as it is interesting to see how people's illness is developing / hopefully ending<br> :date: __2020-12-05 01:21:03__

> It seems to be quite capable but every time I try to give an update of my status it asks me to enter my entire profile again.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 19:12:40__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 17:17:23__

> Since the last update, I no longer receive reminders. I followed what the email said to fix the problem, but it didn't fix it. I rarely report now as I forget to open the app on my own.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 16:48:45__

> Good except recently I've not had reminders due to Android update glitch and I've reinstalled twice and still not getting them.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 14:07:45__

> Useful app for reporting Covid status and for keeping up to date with latest spread of virus throughout England.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 07:17:06__

> Very quick to just check-in each day if you are prompted. Needed to reinstall twice to get prompts working again after glitch.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 11:51:25__

> I cant log off.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:18:42__

> Was great. Since Android update, notifications no longer appear and I often forget to report. Notifications are enabled for this app in my settings, so that's not the problem.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 09:14:01__

> Keeps crashing upon opening on Android, been ok until today<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:57:06__

> Notifications have stopped and I keep forgetting without them<br> :date: __2020-12-03 19:04:23__

> Had it since the beginning and worked well, now i dont get reminders even after updating and following other instructions.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 18:54:36__

> I added 2 test results recently, now everyday the app asks "is this list correct" (of tests). It's a bit annoying. Can you just give an option to add a new test rather than ask each day. Apart from that the app is fine and I'll adjust my review if this minor annoyance is addressed.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 12:39:10__

> No longer getting daily reminders. Unable to rectify this problem<br> :date: __2020-12-02 06:29:15__

> Have been reporting since the very start but every day it says I haven't reported . Updated it as instructed and it said I hadn't logged on for 16 days! Started again to remind me to report when I have. Very frustrating. I'm in the North East where number of cases are large and so important that I report .<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:37:18__

> Good on the whole, though app sometimes says I have not reported for 2-3 days, whereas I do so daily.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 10:45:51__

> It's stopped working for me in the last few days. I now get the big "C19" screen, then a "C19 Loading.." screen, then the main page pops up with the "Report Today, Even if you're Well" button but then about 1s later, the screen just goes white. If feels like an advert is about to pop up but no. I can no longer use the app because of this.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:02:37__

> Worked fine for ages, now it just opens to a blank white screen, my mother's app does the same on her phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 10:28:51__

> DÃ¥ligt att man inte i appen kan se smittspridningen pÃ¥ den plats man Ã¤r.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 16:54:31__

> Not everything is Covid when you are not feeling 100%. I don't understand it. Also fed up of not being recognised when I log in. I wonder what this is good for really.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:55:46__

> Simple to use. However still not able to open after update. Downloaded update as advised on email today 28/11/20 But opens & then disappears!!! Please fix this issue for Android users.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:24:06__
