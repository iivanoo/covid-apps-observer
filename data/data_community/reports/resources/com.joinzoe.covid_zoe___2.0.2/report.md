### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy and important. I trust it<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:55:21__

> Very up to date app, feel the information on here should be needed more. Why couldn't the NHS app and this one join forces?<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:22:20__

> A few issues with notifications recently, but now fixed. I don't tend to remember to update daily unless I receive the notification. Useful info about the virus too.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:02:50__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-11-30 09:40:49__

> Works Well. Like the daily reminder.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 03:47:42__

> Great app helping with the battle against Covid19. keeping us all informed of infection rates and progress with vaccines.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:15:44__

> Fantastic to have the opportunity to contribute to such important research<br> :date: __2020-11-29 21:34:06__

> There was an app upgrade and it lost my COVID test history. As I don't remember the dates I had the tests I have to declare that I haven't had any tests. (Had two.)<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:52:03__

> Seems like a good idea, very simple to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 14:29:31__

> Good usable data glad to help but the reminder even when reported is rather anoying<br> :date: __2020-11-29 12:32:01__

> Worked fine until 25 November update. Now it loads and goes to a blank screen. Update: a couple of days later it has started working again.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 11:48:10__

> It's a little "insensitive" regarding mild symptoms. Seems there is no way to report anything unless you declare more than one known symptom. Unusual or precursor symptoms may be missed. Anyway, worth contributing to to help the fight.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 10:41:30__

> Graph for cases not working<br> :date: __2020-11-29 20:11:13__

> Unfortunately has become worse with recent releases - one logged out users with no notification, meaning a good chunk of users has probably been lost who didn't notice they weren't getting them any more. The current version also doesn't open the app on tapping the notification, making it less seamless to report than before. The lack of a 'send'/'submit' button makes it unclear when a report has been completed. Could use this consistency, particularly given it needs to maintain good sample sizes.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 13:13:24__

> A slight problem. To proceed I have to tap I Have Never Had a Covid Test. I have, it was negative, and I am entirely well.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 10:45:33__

> Excellent for what it's doing. But unfortunately everytime I open to report for the day, it tells me to report for yesterday first. Everytime. And yet I report everyday. It also keeps losing covid-19 tests which I've had.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 12:14:53__

> Fine except for problems logging in, repeatedly. I use an android mobile.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 12:09:18__

> It's a good idea to help keep track BUT since the update it no longer reminds me to do it so now I keep forgetting to do it<br> :date: __2020-11-28 11:34:02__

> I installed from very early on to help with data gathering. Worked fine until 2 weeks ago when I had to fill all the forms in again to keep my account. Saw a message from creators saying there had been a blip which was now sorted. Today I go on to report and it says I haven't done do for 14 days. I have updated it every day and never missed. I'm not sure you really have sorted out your problems!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:45:47__

> Was easy to use but then it crashed. Deleted app then reinstalled. Continued to fail but this morning got in.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:31:25__

> Not always clear when to move to the next page, leaves you hanging, like now, I don't know if this review is going to be submitted or if I've just been wasting my time.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:47:57__

> Was a good app but now can't log in even after following link to reset password. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work either. Just won't recognise password after reset....ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•<br> :date: __2020-11-27 21:52:54__

> Simple to use. However still not able to open after update. Downloaded update as advised on email today 28/11/20 But opens & then disappears!!! Please fix this issue for Android users.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:24:06__

> 23 Nov 2020 I have been participating with the study since lockdown. Suddenly for a week now the requests for daily reports stopped. When I tap on the app. it asked me to create a new account. Why? 27 Nov 2020 Response from Zoe that problems have occurred to several people. Suggested I install the update by clicking on playstore app. Tried thrice, kept on installing...... So I shall terminate. Waste of 3 hours! When I return to original app, it ask me to create a new one. What's happening!<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:50:20__

> Was working well but now gets to home screen and goes blank. Unusable, deleting.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 12:49:26__
