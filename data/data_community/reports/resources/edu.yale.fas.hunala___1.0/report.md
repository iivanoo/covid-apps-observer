### Description
> Get a personalized assessment on your risk of contracting the flu and other respiratory diseases, updated daily.  Keep yourself and your community safe by staying informed about the spread of respiratory disease. Make proactive and intelligent decisions about your health by knowing how likely you are to get sick. 
<br>Hunala leverages cutting edge network science and machine learning (that uses both crowdsourced and public information) to determine your likelihood of contracting the flu or other respiratory illnesses. Using the information you provide about your own location and social interactions, Hunala maps the distribution of symptoms and can offer information about how to avoid contracting an illness. By updating information daily, you have a powerful tool for monitoring risk of exposure.
<br>Hunalaâ€™s networking sensor technology was developed in the lab of Sterling Professor at Yale University, Nicholas A. Christakis, MD, PhD, and his Human Nature Lab team. All results come directly from this research lab.
<br>How Hunala works: list people you spend time with, fill out a brief daily survey to self-report any symptoms you may have, and get daily updates on your exposure risk based on where you live.
<br>Use Hunala to: stay up-to-date on how flu and respiratory disease is spreading through your community, get recommendations on how to avoid contracting the flu, and help your community lower its risk of the flu by crowdsourcing an effective response.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Sorry, a fail out of the gate: I enter my phone; they send a text; I switch to my SMS app to get the code; I switch back to Hunala. It restarts the app and asks for my phone Basic Android event-flow<br> :date: __2020-11-27 19:57:06__

> Very cool idea, but when I enter my phone number (doube and triple checked), no code is sent and I'm left without access to the app<br> :date: __2020-08-15 14:53:31__

> I had high hopes for this app. But the questions are few and don't allow nuance, and the results seem to vary wildly for no reason. I tried to provide feedback, but wasn't answered elsewhere, and in app does not allow questions/help/etc. Very disappointed and feel used<br> :date: __2020-06-09 16:10:03__

> Good idea, but after asking for my contacts, it tells me there is no information available in my area. There are globally available data sources, so that shouldn't be an issue. And you shouldn't need access to my contacts' information. If you know where I am, how many estimated cases there are, the size of the population and how many people I have contact with, you can show me a number representing my risk, and a note about the confidence level of that information.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 13:21:15__

> Way too much personal info asked.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 05:24:30__

> I love the concept. But I am traveling across the U.S. and the app "find my location" tool never works. Yes, my phone GPS is on. Yes, all permissions have been granted. I travel for a living and I know how to use this stuff. I am having no problems with local search, routing, weather and all the other apps that use my phone's GPS location. Just this one. There is something wrong with this app. It is of no use to me if it isn't tracking the many states I'm traveling thru each day.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 14:23:53__
