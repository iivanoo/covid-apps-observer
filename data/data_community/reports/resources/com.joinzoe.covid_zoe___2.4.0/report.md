### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use to give a research data set for the Covid boffins. Not sure whether the app gives personal benefits as I have only been using it for a few weeks. Some people using it are sent a PCR test. If a fourth wave begins it will be useful to know every day how the hot spots develop.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:02:41__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-04-28 19:46:09__

> Easy to use. Useful info that is up to date. Good links to other articles<br> :date: __2021-04-28 12:36:31__

> It works well, is quick and easy and, hopefully, helpful. We have told many about it. The information can be useful but as I have been very anxious since the start of Covid I try not to read the news or numbers. Thank you for all you do.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 12:11:55__

> Easy to use. Providing date.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 15:23:18__

> App functions are a little fuzzy but it does what it needs to.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 18:08:55__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-26 16:55:55__

> Easy to use, and helpful to the scientists. It seems to lose your entries if you add your entry too early in the day<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:59:27__

> If it helps, everybody should do it. The gap for me is that I don't seem to get daily reminders to report information which would increase regularity of reporting<br> :date: __2021-04-25 12:40:20__

> Very clear data exchange. You give some; I give some - and I get to feel good about it.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 11:26:15__

> Hey - as of 6 days ago, I'm not getting daily notifications, so there's a gap in my records. This appears to be a bug.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 12:59:36__

> OKAY<br> :date: __2021-04-23 08:23:40__

> Crashing daily so having to uninstall and reinstall every time ☹<br> :date: __2021-04-22 13:11:09__

> Quick and easy but I am no longer receiving daily reminders. Can this be fixed?<br> :date: __2021-04-22 12:42:54__

> I have been using the app since it was first released and have been happy with it's simplicity and the various articles are interesting and give a lot of insight. I am however, unhappy that despite having the latest version installed I have not been asked about my vaccinations but if I create a new profile the vaccine questions are there but then I lose all the data history I have provided. I have emailed several times but received no response which is very disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-04-21 08:56:53__

> This app used to be good. Its aims are laudable, though when I was too ill to report the same day, there was no way to retrospectively report when I felt better. Now the app (or more likely the server behind it) has become painfully slow. No longer even adequate. Needs sorting out!<br> :date: __2021-04-15 23:34:45__

> Simple & quick, helping the fight with Covid-19. Since the update, the app sometimes fails to register my daily input for up to 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 11:43:39__

> Is there any point in competing this anymore? The information on there hasn't been updated in months, and you haven't updated to include adding vaccination details.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 17:37:49__

> My app on Android will not allow me to add another person as it is for USA only<br> :date: __2021-04-07 08:29:39__

> I'm torn between providing data and potentially contributing to a casedemic<br> :date: __2021-04-06 23:18:28__

> No longer very accurate<br> :date: __2021-04-20 07:41:19__

> Doesn't seem easy enough to use. Can't see it going "viral". (Scuse the pun).<br> :date: __2021-04-15 11:48:20__

> I was in this for over a. Year but your system through me out and I can no longer get into it and can't email anyone. Too baf<br> :date: __2021-04-14 17:41:53__

> This app worked really well, now for some reason, it won't let me log in. I've uninstall and reinstalled and changed my password, nothing has helped 🤷‍♀️<br> :date: __2021-04-13 13:17:59__

> Suddenly asking me to login each time and now not recognizing my account aftrr reinstalling.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 17:53:00__

> Clunky, on a daily basis you need to update your profiles, yet they are only available by scrolling right to the bottom of the home screen, which you have to do again and again for EVERY profile, no thought put into how this is used daily.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 15:40:49__

> Diet insights are a waste of time. This insight would be valid if it reviewed my original diet, but the whole score is simply based on whether your diet has changed, not what it is. This lack of research makes you wonder about the rest of the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 10:08:01__

> Hello! DOES ANYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS APP CARE THAT THE APP DOESN'T RECORD MY DATA? YOU HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO ANY OF MY EMAILS. PLEASE reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 5 days. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 02:43:15__

> So many questions daily. It got tedious.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 01:42:12__

> Good for up to date info. I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-03-10 12:56:37__

> I haven't had any notifications for months, despite the app setting being switched on.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 12:47:37__

> Poor. Connection Difficult always to log in .<br> :date: __2021-04-09 12:28:45__

> I had this app a while ago, uninstalled it but forgot to review it. Fairly poor interface but also I'd question the value of the data gathered and how it can be of real value.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 03:02:39__

> Apparently I'm supposed to be able to log my vaccine on here. Still have not worked out how. Can ask other people log their vaccine, but no idea how to log my own. Very frustrating. I've checked I've got the latest version, I'm pretty tech savvy but still no idea. Given up.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 08:49:24__

> 547 MB of storage used!? This should be such a simple little app!<br> :date: __2021-04-04 15:00:35__

> Still a blank white space where the graphs should be: there were no issues for a long time, then suddenly one day they vanished! All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis & 'Share the graph', nothing else: you can't share what you can't see. No explanation given. Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe a good while back, they acknowledged the problem...but nothing. It is a good app, but I do wish they would take the trouble to sort it out.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 11:56:57__

> Hasn't asked me for update for months. Not sure why it stopped giving me notifications. Using latest (android) version and notifications not blocked on phone<br> :date: __2021-03-28 13:42:39__

> Easy to use. Pleased to be able to help this study. Update March 21 It's lost about 3.5 months of my data. No advice yet on if I need to re-enter vaccine, tests, etc. so currently not logging anything. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 17:44:40__

> Now wont start<br> :date: __2021-03-23 18:19:01__

> Sadly, went pear-shaped during installation: created account, without username or details. Emailed developer; no response. Have uninstalled. 1 star for a good idea.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 15:46:51__
