### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm sure it is helpful for studies. I've had the same long haulers symptoms for several months, so the questionnaire is a little long to repeat everyday until changes may occur.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 17:56:35__

> Once set up it's quick and easy. Takes second everyday. Only thing I'd like to see is space for the underlying health conditions as I'm saying I'm physically normal, and in terms of covid, I am, but I've a chronic condition, so I'm not actually physically " normal".<br> :date: __2021-03-04 12:47:56__

> Very useful way of collecting data. An improvement would be to allow people who were vaccinated before December (in the trials) to enter the dates of their vaccination if they have been "unblinded" . Currently it isn't possible to enter dates before 8 December.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 23:39:07__

> Very easy to use. Rating given was 5. But Update PROBLEMS 3 MARCH 2021 APP SEEMS TO BE EXTREMELY SLOW TO LOAD for daily input AND HAS BEEN FOR 2 OR 3 WEEKS. Rating dropped to 1, sorry<br> :date: __2021-03-05 22:00:03__

> Was interested in contributing but can not set up log in. Keeps saying invalid parameters/missing info. (Yes I went over it several times).<br> :date: __2021-03-05 19:06:38__

> It's been nearly 2 wks, and there is still a blank white space where the graphs should be. All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis and 'Share the graph', nothing else. Ditto for the UK map: that has also become invisible. I have contacted Zoe via the app, I've emailed them twice, and I've still had no response from them about this specific issue.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 15:07:25__

> Just more Spyware<br> :date: __2021-02-27 23:03:23__

> The mental health survey popup appears to have broken the app for me. I cannot do anything except see the popup, so I cannot report my health any more.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 20:56:34__

> Useless since its upgrade have tried to uninstal, reinstalling, forgotten password reset it refuses to work. I will remove it and not bother anymore.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 09:48:35__

> Wouldn't let me register as I don't know my blood group. Totally useless<br> :date: __2021-02-20 14:13:52__

> Pointless, local infection rates reported fluctuate by hundreds day to day. Basically they have no idea what's going on. Not going to bother any more.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 13:53:32__

> Doesn't appear to work. It asks you to report symptoms even if well but the 2 drop down questions are both not applicable and you cannot proceed further. Also, I thought the app wanted you to report if you'd had vaccine and side effects but only option is to share that you've had it on social media? What's the point?<br> :date: __2021-02-16 20:58:48__

> Doesn't work!!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 18:46:32__
