        "Very good app that is easy to use . No problem with push notifications. Would have given 5 stars but for one problem. Example: I noticed when reporting this morning (14 May) that the app said that I hadn't reported for 3 days. This is incorrect and is not the first time that this has happened. There appears to be a problem here where data is not always collected, or has gone missing somehow.",
        "Easy to use. Glad to help! I have recently found that the data for Erewash and Amber Valley seems to have been switched around. There must be a problem with area referencing in Zoe's database. Real world testing has shown a large outbreak in Erewash borough and very low prevalence in Amber Valley borough. Zoe has this completely the wrong way around.",
        "Really easy to use, asks a few questions daily. If you're unwell it offers symptom selection and then an email is sent if they advise a covid test and how to get one. I've logged test results and my vaccine. They work with the government and research. No interfering ads either!",
        "I just want to help improve what we know about the virus, but this app also keeps me up to date with the findings we contribute to. Tim Spector gives regular video updates to users which tease out the meaning of the figures.",
        "Useful tool to follow local and national trends. A great source of information, advice and guidance.",
        "I am sure the app has been very useful in the fight against Covid and it has been a pleasure to participate in the project and very easy to use this app.",
        "An excellent concept and a well made app. Just one suggestion: when you report recurring symptoms post covid infection, on the final page the assumption seems to be that you are isolating at home or in hospital. Could we have an option to say, I'm at work because I've been advised I do not need to isolate? Thanks!",
        "Update 30/4/2021 Daily reminders not coming through for last 6 days - after receiving 2/day for a week or so! Update 27/12/20 Aside from a short term reminder issue in November, the app has been working well, but there's currently a glitch with test reporting so my data has been incomplete since 23rd December. Original Review Spring 2021: Good to feel you are making a contribution, however small, by using this. Like the daily reminder, & link to the website for more information on the study etc.",
        "This app has been my goto app since the pandemic started. It is easy to use, so clear about what is happening rules etc. Far better than the government's app. I feel this app has been honest the whole way through and has been created for the people not just so they can be seen doing something Thank you so much.",
        "App has improved since I first started using it 4 months ago. Still needs some tweeking hence 4* rating. Update: I'm still using the app to report daily and it takes just seconds to report unless you have symptoms to report. During all this time on two occasions I reported particular symptoms and within 24 hrs I was contacted by text asking me to get a test done. If anyone is in any doubt whether their their feedback is read I can assure you it is. I certainly recommend using this app.",
        "I have been using this app since I discovered it early in the pandemic, I believe. I have found it so helpful. I have regularly watched the updates from Professor Tim Spector and some of the webinars. This app has helped to reassure me during this difficult time. The app is also very user friendly. Thank you to everyone who is/has been involved. I truly believe you are all lifesavers.",
        "The app has been working fine on ipad and android phone until today. Didn't recognise me so had to re register, so then showed my last report as 239 days ago. I have had to replace my phone and it is now showing as last reported 158 days ago. Luckily I can still report on my ipad. I have re rated up to 5 star,as I'm guessing that it may be at my end that it isn't working correctly.",
        "Super useful, incredibly user friendly, and always full of information to help you understand the numbers. Please get your friends and family involved - even if you think the risk is reducing we should be tracking symptoms and tests and vaccinations!!",
        "Worked really well until a couple of weeks ago when I stopped getting notifications. I need these to remind me to update every day. I managed to get them back for around 3 days they then stopped again. Hence why only gave 3 stars.",
        "I enjoy participating in this study but do rely on the daily reminder, which seemingly randomly turns off every now and then. I've now missed a whole week as the notifications simply stopped. Edit 4/5/21 - all notifs are on, but I have not had a reminder for the last three days.",
        "Initially it worked well . Then i could not log in,tried many things ,incl password reset,i did get support, but coulnt get it working . Some months later, trying again, i was asked to sign into microsoft email again,and hey presto it worked. I think i was just unlucky. No probs now. Sign up its probably the best tracker in the business! 22.2.2021 Second time failed to be able to report. I think the failure prob dates to the last upgrade. Making the app for me useless. Going to delete and reload",
        "Fantastic app. Great to be able to contribute to research. A couple of suggestions for improvements: 1. I suggest reversing the order of tests, so most recent is first (or allow user to choose sort order). I'm tested regularly now and it would be easier to check and update test results. 2. A minor bug: you can move to previous pages of the questionnaire, but you can't then move forward and have to start again. Thanks!",
        "Easy to use to give a research data set for the Covid boffins. Not sure whether the app gives personal benefits as I have only been using it for a few weeks. Some people using it are sent a PCR test. If a fourth wave begins it will be useful to know every day how the hot spots develop.",
        "Was using it every day. But I've not been getting push notifications for several weeks now. Shame. (Old Review) I started getting the notifications again and it's been working fine for several months. But now I'm getting 2 notifications at about the same time each day. (A reply from the Developers to reviews would be a nice touch.)",
        "Often miss days of reporting because the app doesn't remind me on a daily basis but it's important for all of us to sign up for the common good of us all. Ok update on 21.2.21, it's fixed, app reminds me every day and haven't missed a single one. Now when I've reported for me it just needs to prompt me to report for others without me going hunting for that bit. Then I'll award the 5th star.",
        "Love this app and what it's doing to help. One small gripe is that on several occasions it logs me out and it can be weeks until I remember that I've not had a prompt to log how I'm feeling. Otherwise it's great.",
        "Been great to be a part of since March/April last year. Do forget occasionally but a great way of keeping covid test dates and vaccination dates to hand. Anyone had an issue with the app and the dates of their doses? I report for myself and my fiance and recently I noticed both had the same dates in for both our doses. I changed my fiances to the right dates and it automatically changed mine to his. Tried again and same thing happens. This will skew stats if its happening to everyone.",
        "Still a blank white space where the graphs should be: there were no issues for a long time, then suddenly one day they vanished! All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis & 'Share the graph', nothing else: you can't share what you can't see. No explanation given. Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe a good while back, they acknowledged the problem...but nothing. It is a good app, but I do wish they would take the trouble to sort it out.",
        "Initial setup difficult as it would not accept my password, or maybe was just locking up? It finally accepted the same password that I was trying to use! Otherwise has been OK to use since. Update: 29April 21 Changed my phone now won't let me log in. Password reset email doesn't arrive.",
        "Fab app. Very quick and easy to use. Lots of opportunities to help with research by filling in surveys and sometimes personal results and insights are given. I also enjoy the weekly report from Professor Tim and am interested in viewing different trends which appear. Lots to learn, plenty of information available and greatly appreciated. Thank you for the opportunity to get involved \ud83d\ude42",
        "I have been using the app since it was first released and have been happy with it's simplicity and the various articles are interesting and give a lot of insight. I am however, unhappy that despite having the latest version installed I have not been asked about my vaccinations but if I create a new profile the vaccine questions are there but then I lose all the data history I have provided. I have emailed several times but received no response which is very disappointing.",
        "Does not seem to recognise lateral flow tests. Could not input vaccine side effects 4 days later, wanted me to go for a test. I really struggle with the feeling fine /not quite right question when pre menstrual. If I'm honest, I get sent for an unnecessary test. If I'm not honest, there's no point in doing it! I wish there was a way of saying 'I'm not right but I'm pretty certain that it's because of this'",
        "I think this app is great and if the information gathered is helping the fight against Covid 19 that's amazing, however I used to get daily notifications reminding me to log my health, symptoms etc but for the last 3 months or so I haven't been getting them despite the notifications for the app being switched on. I find I forget now which is a shame.",
        "The app works well and gives excellent scientific feedback. It is very helpful to have access to the latest scientific updates and opinions: on vaccines, on mutations of the virus and possible associated risks and on the distribution of covid cases across the country.",
        "Very useful, gathering real time information from millions of people. Can give early insights to whats going on. Identified new covid symptoms from what people are reporting. Gathering and looking at data about symptoms, tests, vaccines, long covid, lifestyle. Also updates from the team about how things are going from what they gather from the data.i do daily check in for myself and family. I would encourage everyone to use it. The more people, the more data and more information.",
        "I do try and remember every day as I know my input is useful for research. Have been unable to set reminders on my tablet . Just doesn't seem to work. Also have to delete and re install every time there's an update. Update : the app still has issues if ever I turn my tablet off completely. It stops working properly then and I have to re install. Annoying",
        "The app improve notably on the design aspect on recent times. I fairly used it last year quite a lot and provide data with my lifestyle and test results. It's true I don't use it for a while and now there is loads of graphs and literature based on recent studies that seems so interesting. In general, I like it and I think it's useful.",
        "Excellent app which provides scientists with extremely important Data about vaccine uptake, and people's reactions to it, and how they're feeling day to day, so it gives real time information about Covid Symptoms and the effects of the vaccine rollout.",
        "Frustrated. You can only put your weight in in pounds (seriously? pounds? my watch must be fast, I thought we were in the 21st century) so I went away to google my weight in pounds and I came back and the app had restarted and I could no longer enter any data. There doesn't seem to be any way to change this data, so I assume I appear as a 0lb woman. If there were any questions after weight, they are blank too.",
        "This app gives local and national updates, rates of infection and positive cases. I haven't used everything on it but once I have my vaccination tomorrow that will potentially open more information relevant to me. You can use the app just for yourself or add others such as family or elderly neighbours who aren't tech savvy (not that you need to be for this).takes few seconds daily, tap on info already held,if it hasn't changed,or alter,easy to update if needed.Excellent app,hassle free.",
        "Very easy and quick to use, gives a good indication daily of Covid rates in one's local area in near-real time (also graphed, so very easy to visually take in), which is not available anywhere else; allows me to do my little bit to help scientists understand Covid-19 better, and so help us all; interesting occasional blog posts & weekly updates on the situation from the lead researcher, Professor Tim Spector. Occasionally stops reminding me daily to fill it in. To fix, logout & reinstall.",
        "Good app, the information is interesting and relevant, and it's great to be contributing to the Covid effort. However, there are a few bugs: it sometimes logs you out without warning, and logging symptoms for another person was frustrating: despite setting up their profile initially, it made me set up their profile again each time I tried to log their symptoms, so I gave up on that and only log my own now. Would still recommend the app, though.",
        "Does not work if you press the back button. Have to go right back to the beginning if you are logging any symptoms or side effects. Would like there to be a continued side effects option. I feel that I am logging the same side effect every day but I got the app some time after the side effects started.",
        "Only choices are \"I've never had a covid test\" or \"add new test\" Have tried to add my Imperial college survey test, but end up in a bit of a circular loop, so abandoned. Each time I log in, I'm presented with same choice so have been choosing \"I've never had a test\" ...which of course, isn't the case",
        "User friendly and simple, sometimes the alerts stop even though I've given permission which means I can forget to add daily info. So great to see all the findings as a result of the data."
