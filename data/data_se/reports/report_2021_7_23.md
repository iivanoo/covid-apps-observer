## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | KRY International |
| **Website**  | [https://kry.se](https://kry.se) |
| **Email** | support@kry.se |
| **Physical address**  | [KRY International AB Torsgatan 21 113 21 Stockholm](https://www.google.com/maps/search/KRY%20International%20AB%20Torsgatan%2021%20113%2021%20Stockholm) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> While doctors are good, app does not have a "help, service desk" option. My prescription was not successfully added to my account, and there was no way to contact them for help.

> I had a disappointing experience. The nurse essentially just told me to go to a pharmacy for all my issues. No specific recommendations what so ever. Well, at the pharmacy they told me I'd need to see a doctor, of course. Overall, they just wasted my time and charged me for it. This user interface is nice though.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 14:03:31__

> Very unpleasant appointments. Doc just wants to get it done with as fast as possible.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 12:49:25__

> App is streamlined and easy to use. Doctors whoever will literally just tell you to either take Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for everything or to go to a Health Clinic for anything, can't even renew prescription for basic ear drops in the middle of a pandemic because they think it's safer to crowd clinics for minor ear pain at a time like this than to give you anything other than anti inflammatories that crush your liver. Ends up not being more help than simply going to r/askadoctor or Quora.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 05:27:08__

> The app itself is working fine. I spoke to two different doctors and got totaly different answers. The last one told me that I don't need to take any medicine. After controlling this with 1177 is this also wrong (antibiotics shall be used).<br> :date: __2021-01-16 12:02:59__

> I had a urology question. Long delays with misleading 'just a few minutes', no good for specialist questions. Just go directly to the specialist if you need one. The app could have told me so via FAQ or so.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 18:27:22__

> Kunde inte byta sråk till svenska har min mobil inställd på engelska är lättaste för mig att fatta inställningarna då appar blir oftast automatiskt påå engelska brukar inte ha problem med att byta menn av nån anledning vill spåkändring till sevska inte funka. Inga större problem för mig litee svårt attt fatta viss information. Ville se om de fans online chatt ville mäst ha råd om jag borde åka in och få de kollat verka bara finnas vidochat<br> :date: __2020-05-10 00:25:41__

> Det verkar som om läkarna inte läser det jag skriver och inte heller läst journalen ordentligt. Fick fel medicin utskrivet två gånger på rad för samma åkomma. Ge patienten liter mer tid och uppmärksamhet istället.<br> :date: __2020-04-13 12:49:56__

> This is the 2nd time that I've used this app in the hopes of getting help and sadly they were anything but. The first time it was a question related to my pregnancy and I was just asked to contact my barnmorska. The second time I was in pain and had a question related to breastfeeding and after asking my question the same thing happened! Why do you offer barnmorska support if you really don't offer any help? I'm only putting 2 stars because they were quick in taking my call.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 23:16:03__

> Did speak with a doctor quickly, however had to go to another physician to match treatment with the diagnosis<br> :date: __2020-03-29 14:03:32__

> Usually quite nice to save long waiting at the VC, in particular with restless kids. But last time was bad: we suspected hand-foot-mouth but didn't want to bias them. They diagnosed a combo of fungi and rash and prescribed 1 cream for each. 2 days later dagis let's us pick him up, had to go to VC and of course it was HFM... That should have been obvious and more logical imo, cannot believe they missed it.<br> :date: __2020-02-10 07:03:49__

> If you accidentally exit the app the call is gone and you are screwed... Also dont help the fact that kry vårdcentral has the worst doctors I ever met. Fresh now if you are goimg to call them to rebook you basically cant and you forced to pay the 400 sek for not showing up even though the doctor had more than 20 min to still meet me.. What a joke of a vårdcentral. Dont even waste your time here<br> :date: __2021-04-07 14:29:51__

> Gick inte att boka tiden för en PCR-test, då man kunde inte välja en mottagning (man kunde se olika alternativ, men inget hände när man tryckte på dem). Högst frustrerande, och ett slöseri med tid.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 12:22:52__

> There are several good and bad points about this app. We all know good so lets talk about the bad side- The support number given in the app does not work, it never worked for me! Whenever called, you never get a chance to talk to a real person and there is all sorts of waiting line music that you hear and no information about your queue number in case you decide to hung up. There is no email address provided so if you have any problem with the app or any questions, guess what? you will never get any answers The most important thing, Kry does not save your third party medical records (the reports received from other clinics) to 1177 and you can't access it because kry uses NPÖ and no one else than kry practitioners can access it, not even the doctors at general vårdcentral. Also, if you think that the doctor at Kry is going to be kind and listen to all your health issues and will be patient in listening to you then you are WRONG! The doctor that i visited told me within 15 minutes of my allotted appointment that he had another patient to attend to and therefore i must book another appointment if i had any other health issues to discuss. Kry had been good application when it comes to resolving health issues for children or even smaller scale health issues but it definitely needs to step up and provide correct information to the patients who come with serious or more complex health issues.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 22:16:39__

> Läkare var sarkastisk. Han är svensk, inte heller arabisk talande enligt önskemål, trots enligt app har de 28 ST som pratar Arabiska.inget anamnes tagits allt, startade samtalet direkt tyvärr kan inte hjälpa er och ni behöver byta hälsocentral, kan inte ta prover utan undersöka, och om vi vill kan vi ta det privat.även osteoporos utredningar som tas muntlig var inte lustig att ta det här samtalet.vår upplevelse att dålig bemötande och värdelös hjälp.ingen skillnad från vanlig HC.rekomenderar ej<br> :date: __2021-03-23 17:50:45__

> Välfärden dukar under och det är detta vi lägger pengarna på istället för fler sköterskor på äldreboendena.

> Hell no. Don't use this app.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 18:40:28__

> Saw an add for a self test. Downloaded the app and then there were no self test. Badly structured campaign.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 13:33:04__

> I have har two apointments in this app. Both were very un pleasant. The first one basically told me that it was my medicines fault and sent me to my regular clinic and the second one was extremely rude, only repeated the same thing which I explained didn't work, He told me he was going to prescribe me some medicine (never told me what medicine) and then just didn't prescribed them and just sent me a text with tips. I will NEVER use this app again. I would rather burn 200sek than pay them to kry!<br> :date: __2021-02-04 11:12:26__
