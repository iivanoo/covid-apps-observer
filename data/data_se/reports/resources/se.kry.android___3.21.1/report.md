## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | KRY International |

| **Email** | support@kry.se |
| **Physical address**  | [KRY International AB Torsgatan 21 113 21 Stockholm](https://www.google.com/maps/search/KRY%20International%20AB%20Torsgatan%2021%20113%2021%20Stockholm) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I had a urology question. Long delays with misleading 'just a few minutes', no good for specialist questions. Just go directly to the specialist if you need one. The app could have told me so via FAQ or so.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 18:27:22__

> Kunde inte byta sråk till svenska har min mobil inställd på engelska är lättaste för mig att fatta inställningarna då appar blir oftast automatiskt påå engelska brukar inte ha problem med att byta menn av nån anledning vill spåkändring till sevska inte funka. Inga större problem för mig litee svårt attt fatta viss information. Ville se om de fans online chatt ville mäst ha råd om jag borde åka in och få de kollat verka bara finnas vidochat<br> :date: __2020-05-10 00:25:41__

> Det verkar som om läkarna inte läser det jag skriver och inte heller läst journalen ordentligt. Fick fel medicin utskrivet två gånger på rad för samma åkomma. Ge patienten liter mer tid och uppmärksamhet istället.<br> :date: __2020-04-13 12:49:56__

> This is the 2nd time that I've used this app in the hopes of getting help and sadly they were anything but. The first time it was a question related to my pregnancy and I was just asked to contact my barnmorska. The second time I was in pain and had a question related to breastfeeding and after asking my question the same thing happened! Why do you offer barnmorska support if you really don't offer any help? I'm only putting 2 stars because they were quick in taking my call.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 23:16:03__

> Did speak with a doctor quickly, however had to go to another physician to match treatment with the diagnosis<br> :date: __2020-03-29 14:03:32__

> Usually quite nice to save long waiting at the VC, in particular with restless kids. But last time was bad: we suspected hand-foot-mouth but didn't want to bias them. They diagnosed a combo of fungi and rash and prescribed 1 cream for each. 2 days later dagis let's us pick him up, had to go to VC and of course it was HFM... That should have been obvious and more logical imo, cannot believe they missed it.<br> :date: __2020-02-10 07:03:49__

> Meetings disconnect due to doctors bad reception. I've spent a long time waiting several times and got connected. No customer service available unless you spend time on a phone...<br> :date: __2020-02-05 10:00:08__

> Appen suger. Stått mindre än 5min till läkarbesöket i över 50min. Fick ringa till supporten. Läkaren var proffsig och trevlig. Alltså tack vare läkaren ger jag 2 stjärnor, annars skulle gett 0 stjärnor. Läkaren får 5 stjärnor.<br> :date: __2020-01-24 18:10:36__

> No way to see Privacy policy in English version of app. No way to view the Swedish ToS during registration in the English version, even if it states that the Swedish edition will overpower the English one if there is anything lost in translation. This is a serious flaw. Also giving wrong time when booking meeting. Country and UTC + hour code does not match the actual time in specifc country. Not sure which one to follow. Country or UTC code?<br> :date: __2019-06-07 09:53:56__

> Soon after downloading the app it says that you are not connected to the internet. Reinstalled twice same error.<br> :date: __2018-11-11 10:54:27__

> They always say they can't help you and you need to see a doctor at vårdcentral. Why the hell don't they tell the patient before, they have the info they need prior to the consultation. Who needs a doctor to tell you to see another doctor and charge for that? Today I booked for weight loss (a service they offer) and within 30 sec of seing my face dr said he didn't think I looked fat (I'm obese) and refused to refer me because he didnt believe my weight. He didnt even bother looking at my files<br> :date: __2020-12-11 18:12:14__

> I don't recommend it.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 09:25:41__

> After all data (health insurance data multiple times!) have been entered, the process always ends with "no appointment available". No indication of next appointments, or how or when you could look again. And: Only private prescriptions are issued, health insurance patients are allowed to reach into their pockets. Worthless.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 14:24:02__

> Wow, if I could give minus starts I actually would. This was a really bad experience. I met an unfriendly doctor who was totally not interested in me and my symptoms. I am not only still sick but also really sad after this experience. I have to pay 200 SEK for an unfriendly meeting with no help at all. If you can avoid kry, do it. This was simply pointless.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 15:48:20__

> Kry kinda sus tho ngl<br> :date: __2020-11-01 12:33:52__

> Behandlar sina anställda som skit. Bojkotta!<br> :date: __2020-11-01 12:33:39__

> it's useless in every sense of the word. the app does not show the doctor's messages. furthermore, the doctor is not able to prescribe any medicine. I just had to wait 2 days then stay at home for nothing.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 16:52:21__

> Kom och revolutionerade vården. Nu dock rent girigt företag som roffar åt sig av välfärd genom att syna varje kryphål. Direkt skadligt för välfärden. Vart en trogen kund sen starten, men nu avinstallerat efter fusket i region sthlm uppdagades.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 09:35:27__

> By agreeing to the terms of this service, you will be enlisted to one of their connected healthcare centres (i.e. they change your "Mina vårdval"). Techically not against the law, but really, really distasteful acting by these loophole seekers.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 06:13:07__

> Är det ens helt lagligt att prompta att lista sig till ny VC?<br> :date: __2020-10-01 13:24:25__
