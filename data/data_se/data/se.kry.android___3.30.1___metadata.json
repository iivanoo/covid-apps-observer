        "Fantastic user experience, clean interface. Everything worked smooth. I was getting a vaccine taken abroad registered in Norway and received very good instructions on how to do it using Kry App",
        "Very nice app. It gets you in touch with experienced professionals who are adept at getting you the right care.",
        "No option to select a language. Doctor ended the call within 10 seconds saying she doesn't speak English so book another appointment. The next one isn't until tomorrow, so that doesn't really help if you've already been waiting a day for a consultation. Don't recommend if you're dealing with stress, the App experience will probably make you feel worse.",
        "A modern digitalized society like Sweden definitly needs such service like Kry. This is not an option, is a necessity. I like the implementation, UX/UI. There are minor bugs on the calls like control on the microphone and speaker but in total I fully support Kry, where you don't need to wait 2 months in stress just to visit a GP and ask for a symptom you have! Quick medical care is a must. Accessible for everyone. Realization of a fair sustainable society.",
        "They helped me many times. I just miss an easier way to book appointments with the doctors in the clinic when the webcam is not enough. Because I always have to call to the clinic phone number or go through a webcam phase for them to book me.",
        "The comment is not for the app, is more about the services they provide. It is quite poor and is absolutely waste of time and money to talk to many of their physician. For every simple task like renewal of medicines and a referral to specialist (for very obvious thing and when MRI result is available) they refer to GP.",
        "I use it today for the first time and the doctor was so cooperative. Its feel like I am in a doctors Chamber likr physically. Thanks to KRY for their great initiative.",
        "Amazing app, great UI, easy to navigate",
        "Appointments are handy and vaccine appointment was quick with reminders",
        "Problem free, quick and easy. Got appointment in 1/2 hour, not like V\u00e5rdcentralen which told me to ring again in 4 days to TRY to get appointment time. Definitely will use from now on",
        "Everything accurate and well organized",
        "It's good application. You can have an appointment with doctor really fast.",
        "Very good medical service, quick appointment and you get advice over video call.",
        "The PCR test didn't get ready within the primised time so we missed the flight and the hotel.",
        "Hi hello this is my frist time to used this , thank you and more power, and keep safe, and have a nice day.",
        "There are several good and bad points about this app. We all know good so lets talk about the bad side- The support number given in the app does not work, it never worked for me! Whenever called, you never get a chance to talk to a real person and there is all sorts of waiting line music that you hear and no information about your queue number in case you decide to hung up. There is no email address provided so if you have any problem with the app or any questions, guess what? you will never get any answers The most important thing, Kry does not save your third party medical records (the reports received from other clinics) to 1177 and you can't access it because kry uses NP\u00d6 and no one else than kry practitioners can access it, not even the doctors at general v\u00e5rdcentral. Also, if you think that the doctor at Kry is going to be kind and listen to all your health issues and will be patient in listening to you then you are WRONG! The doctor that i visited told me within 15 minutes of my allotted appointment that he had another patient to attend to and therefore i must book another appointment if i had any other health issues to discuss. Kry had been good application when it comes to resolving health issues for children or even smaller scale health issues but it definitely needs to step up and provide correct information to the patients who come with serious or more complex health issues.",
        "If you accidentally exit the app the call is gone and you are screwed... Also dont help the fact that kry v\u00e5rdcentral has the worst doctors I ever met. Fresh now if you are goimg to call them to rebook you basically cant and you forced to pay the 400 sek for not showing up even though the doctor had more than 20 min to still meet me.. What a joke of a v\u00e5rdcentral. Dont even waste your time here",
        "App is streamlined and easy to use. Doctors whoever will literally just tell you to either take Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for everything or to go to a Health Clinic for anything, can't even renew prescription for basic ear drops in the middle of a pandemic because they think it's safer to crowd clinics for minor ear pain at a time like this than to give you anything other than anti inflammatories that crush your liver. Ends up not being more help than simply going to r/askadoctor or Quora.",
        "I have har two apointments in this app. Both were very un pleasant. The first one basically told me that it was my medicines fault and sent me to my regular clinic and the second one was extremely rude, only repeated the same thing which I explained didn't work, He told me he was going to prescribe me some medicine (never told me what medicine) and then just didn't prescribed them and just sent me a text with tips. I will NEVER use this app again. I would rather burn 200sek than pay them to kry!",
        "I love this app. It is so convenient. And so far the doctors are very nice and competent. I will use that every time I can now.",
        "I think this is the best \ud83d\udc4c app to me so far . Google team keep it \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udc4c up",
        "Saw an add for a self test. Downloaded the app and then there were no self test. Badly structured campaign.",
        "Quick and easy. Best way to see a doctor for issues that do not require personal contact in the current situation.",
        "It would be much better if in section \"doctor who speaks your language\" an information includes about a doctor and his/her specialisation",
        "I had my first Covid vaccine with Key. Smooth and perfect",
        "Very good doctors, very good nurses.. very nice clinic. I am very satisfied.",
        "When the doctor called me, the video was just black then the app crashed, twice in a row. The doctor didn't call me back after and I didn't get any money back.",
        "A fabulous and definately positive experience.",
        "Good application and fast appointments",
        "Very best app and nice personal\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18",
        "I had a disappointing experience. The nurse essentially just told me to go to a pharmacy for all my issues. No specific recommendations what so ever. Well, at the pharmacy they told me I'd need to see a doctor, of course. Overall, they just wasted my time and charged me for it. This user interface is nice though.",
        "Says see a doctor in minutes but my earliest option is 5 days from now? Eh?",
        "While doctors are good, app does not have a \"help, service desk\" option. My prescription was not successfully added to my account, and there was no way to contact them for help. Only option was to pay 200sek and get a doctors appointment to fix a technical problem.",
        "Great experience! I got an appointment very quickly. The doctor was kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend for non-critical GP consulting. (Especially to encourage social distancing by avoiding cramped waiting rooms)",
        "Thank you for all your medicine services.",
        "Useless. I have a positive test from a lab that needs antibiotics. The doctor only referred me to another useless instance \"v\u00e5rd central\" where they never answer the phone and you can't book a time online if you are no longer living in Sweden. Swedish health care is a joke.",
        "The app itself is working fine. I spoke to two different doctors and got totaly different answers. The last one told me that I don't need to take any medicine. After controlling this with 1177 is this also wrong (antibiotics shall be used).",
        "After all data (health insurance data multiple times!) have been entered, the process always ends with \"no appointment available\". No indication of next appointments, or how or when you could look again. And: Only private prescriptions are issued, health insurance patients are allowed to reach into their pockets. Worthless.",
        "No way to see Privacy policy in English version of app. No way to view the Swedish ToS during registration in the English version, even if it states that the Swedish edition will overpower the English one if there is anything lost in translation. This is a serious flaw. Also giving wrong time when booking meeting. Country and UTC + hour code does not match the actual time in specifc country. Not sure which one to follow. Country or UTC code?",
        "This is the 2nd time that I've used this app in the hopes of getting help and sadly they were anything but. The first time it was a question related to my pregnancy and I was just asked to contact my barnmorska. The second time I was in pain and had a question related to breastfeeding and after asking my question the same thing happened! Why do you offer barnmorska support if you really don't offer any help? I'm only putting 2 stars because they were quick in taking my call."
