## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Disclaimer 

This report has been produced independently of any parties and its only objective is to help anybody in better understanding how COVID-related apps work in practice (and compare to each other). The results of this report are limited to the specific version of the software used for running the analyses and on the various heuristics implemented in there.

### Description
> Questa App è stata sviluppata e viene costantemente aggiornata con l'obiettivo di valutare (attraverso la definizione di modelli statistici e matematici) il rischio di trasmissione (e il comportamento epidemico) del virus attraverso il monitoraggio:
<br>- del numero dei contatti
<br>- della durata dei contatti;
<br>- della distanza presente tra i contatti rilevati rispetto alla durata del contatto.
<br>Sm-Covid-19 non acquisisce dati personali ne dati sanitari: Ti preghiamo di visualizzare il video introduttivo per avere maggiori dettagli sullo scopo e sul funzionamento di questa App. 
<br>Se desideri maggiori dettagli tecnici sul funzionamento di Sm-Covid-19 puoi visitare questo link: https://www.smcovid19.org/recover/
<br>Sm-Covid-19 non acquisisce dati sensibili dell’utente (ne ha bisogno di tali dati per funzionare), salvo nel momento in cui sia l'utente stesso a decidere di utilizzare il modulo di segnalazione per comunicare il suo sospetto di essere infetto. Il modulo di auto-segnalazione non sarà attivo durante la fase di Beta Testing.
<br>Durante la fase di Beta Testing esteso, in concomitanza con l'avvio della fase 2, ci occorrerà un gran numero di utenti attivi, per poter migliorare i modelli di stima del contagio: Al momento siamo una piccola community di 30.000 volontari, ma per poter eseguire calcoli statistici precisi ti chiediamo di aiutarci a diffondere l'App tra tutti i tuoi contatti, sopratutto quelli con i quali presumibilmente potresti entrare in contatto durante la fase 2.
<br>Ci teniamo a ricordarti che SOLO le autorità sanitarie possono indicare la positività di un soggetto. I valori di rischio indicati in Sm-Covid-19 NON possono essere considerate diagnosi di positività o negatività al Covid-19: Lo scopo di questa APP è di generare modelli rappresentativi del contagio (modelli matematici) e statistiche accurate.
<br>L’utente non viene geo-localizzato, né viene reso riconoscibile, salvo nel caso in cui esso stesso decida di condividere di suo spontanea volontà i dati GPS attraverso il menù Impostazioni -> Abilita condivisione dati GPS.  
<br>I dati GPS verranno registrati SOLO quando verranno rilevati dei contatti. Se nessun utente viene rilevato nei dintorni, nessun dato viene acquisito. È possibile disabilitare in qualsiasi momento l'acquisizione dei dati GPS. 
<br>Le informazioni acquisite (solo numero, tipo di contatto, distanza e dati GPS se abilitati) saranno condivise con le sole autorità sanitarie. Il codice sorgente sarà condiviso con le autorità competenti e sarà reso disponibile a fine emergenza.
<br>Sm-Covid-19 è stata sviluppata e viene manutenuta senza fini economici né di acquisizione di dati sensibili. 
<br>Sm-Covid-19 non può essere considerata sostitutiva di una diagnosi medica.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Softmining Srl |
| **Website**  | [https://www.smcovid19.org/](https://www.smcovid19.org/) |
| **Email** | smcovid19@softmining.it |
| **Physical address**  | [Via Tenente Corrado 22 - 83100 Avellino - Italia](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Via%20Tenente%20Corrado%2022%20-%2083100%20Avellino%20-%20Italia) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Softmining+Srl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Softmining+Srl) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> allertaLOM è l’App di Regione Lombardia che permette di ricevere le allerte di Protezione Civile emesse dal Centro Funzionale Monitoraggio Rischi naturali di Regione Lombardia, in previsione di eventi naturali con possibili danni sul territorio.
<br>allertaLOM, in occasione dell’emergenza Coronavirus in Lombardia, si è evoluta in uno strumento di partecipazione attiva della cittadinanza al monitoraggio della diffusione del virus e in un canale di informazioni aggiornate sulle disposizioni regionali in materia, attraverso due nuove funzionalità:
<br>•	CercaCovid – la partecipazione al sondaggio CercaCovid permette a Regione Lombardia di quantificare il livello di diffusione del contagio e la distribuzione territoriale della positività, sulla base dei sintomi segnalati dagli utenti. I dati raccolti servono per analisi statistiche ed epidemiologiche, fondamentali per aiutare le autorità sanitarie a definire modelli e strategie di contrasto al Coronavirus. Il questionario è volontario, completamente anonimo, non prevede alcuna geolocalizzazione e non sostituisce una valutazione medica delle proprie condizioni. Partecipare è importante, anche in assenza di sintomi: più dati si ricevono, più il quadro della situazione è preciso. 
<br>•	Notifiche sull’emergenza Coronavirus in Lombardia - sono state attivate notifiche push con il link alla pagina del portale istituzionale che contiene gli aggiornamenti sul tema. Le notifiche possono essere disattivate dall'utente nell'apposita sezione. 
<br>Scarica l’App per:
<br>•	partecipare al monitoraggio attivo della diffusione del Coronavirus;
<br>•	ricevere informazioni aggiornate sulle azioni intraprese da Regione Lombardia per l’emergenza Coronavirus 
<br>•	personalizzare la ricezione delle notifiche sulle ultime disposizioni regionali riguardanti l’emergenza Coronavirus
<br>•	restare sempre aggiornato sulle allerte di Protezione Civile in Lombardia;
<br>•	monitorare la situazione di allerta sui Comuni preferiti oppure su tutta la regione;
<br>•	seguire l’evoluzione su mappa dei li-velli di allerta nell’arco di 36 ore;
<br>•	personalizzare la ricezione delle notifiche su tutti i rischi naturali oppure sui singoli rischi;
<br>•	ricevere notifiche all’emissione di allerte nei Comuni preferiti sui rischi prescelti;
<br>•	scaricare e consultare i documenti di allerta
<br>Come funziona l’allertamento di Protezione civile in Regione Lombardia
<br>•	Le allerte riguardano i rischi naturali prevedibili (idrogeologico, idraulico, temporali forti, vento forte, neve, valanghe e incendi boschivi) e presentano livelli crescenti di criticità (codice verde, giallo, arancione, rosso) a seconda della gravità ed estensione dei fenomeni. I documenti di allerta sono destinati al sistema locale di Protezione Civile e forniscono indicazioni per attivare le misure di contrasto previste nei Piani Comunali di Protezione Civile. Per i cittadini, le allerte sono uno strumento per sapere quando adottare le misure di auto-protezione, seguendo le indicazioni dell’Autorità locale di Protezione Civile. Per maggiori informazioni, consultare la pagina sulle allerte sul Portale di Regione Lombardia.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Regione Lombardia |
| **Website**  | [http://www.allertalom.regione.lombardia.it](http://www.allertalom.regione.lombardia.it) |
| **Email** | info.allertalom@ariaspa.it |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regione+Lombardia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regione+Lombardia) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Recensione basata solo sullo scopo di base dell'app: fornire allerte dalla Protezione Civile. Fa bene quello che deve fare, con utili informazioni aggiuntive e la possibilità di scaricare i documenti originali delle allerte. Se si usa assieme ad una buona app meteo offre previsioni, facili da capire, sulla potenziale violenza dell'evento meteo previsto. Per quanto riguarda la parte sul CoViD, nel peggiore degli scenari risulterà una componente inutile, non capisco il perché delle lamentele...<br> :date: __2020-06-01 15:06:15__

> Da tempo invio cercacovid invariata dal primo invio, eccetto per la temperatura, che mai corrisponde a quella effettiva. Sempre bisogna aumentarla o diminuirla. Anche il questionario e' sempre approssimativo perche' non c'e la possibilita' di precisare come ci si sente veramente. So che partiranno i test sul sangue, avro' la possibilita' di farlo? Vorrei poter uscire di casa ma senza mascherina esercitando la mia liberta' responsabile con attenzione e a non creare problemi al prossimo. Saluti.<br> :date: __2020-05-31 17:23:22__

> L'ho installata per avere informazioni sul coronavirus nella mia zona e per partecipare al monitoraggio. Però non fornisce le informazioni che avrei voluto avere (casi e decessi per comune, allerte in caso di aumento dei casi anomalo nelle vicinanze).

> Reputo l'app un utile iniziativa, ma tecnologicamente antiquata ed orpellosa. Tutti gli utenti con uno smartphone in Italia oggi concedono tramite le app scaricate in media 2,6 autorizzazioni di tracciamento a testa (facebook, tripadvisor, whatsapp, etc). semplificate con una raccolta dati volontaria ed automatizzata per chi vi concede la tracciatura non anonima. Consentite ai pendolari fuori regione di partecipare dato che trascorrono mediamente piú di metá giornata su territorio Lombardo.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 09:42:56__

> Peccato che non dà la possibilità di modificare l'età di se stessi. Grazie Grazie per la risposta, ho disinstallato e reinstallato l'app ed ho aggiornato il dato. Ne approfitto per chiedere se potreste aggiungere anche: - hai fatto il test sierologico? Magari può comunque essere utile. Saluti e grazie<br> :date: __2020-05-16 07:07:05__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> La gestione della pandemia COVID-19, caratterizzata da una alta trasmissibilità del virus e da una contagiosità elevata anche durante il periodo asintomatico, richiede misure di isolamento sociale e di monitoraggio attivo delle condizioni di salute dei cittadini. 
<br>La Regione Siciliana ha avviato, dal 1 Marzo 2020, una procedura di registrazione per chi è entrato nel territorio regionale, indipendentemente dalla zona di provenienza e dal mezzo di trasporto attraverso il sito http://www.siciliacoronavirus.it, che è la modalità da utilizzare per poter ricevere le proprie credenziali per utilizzare l'APP Sicilia Si Cura.
<br>Tale procedura è stato un primo passo verso il monitoraggio attivo di uno dei principali veicoli di ingresso del virus: i contagiati asintomatici che inconsapevolmente agiscono da moltiplicatori di esposizione al rischio da COVID-19.
<br>Il passo successivo è quello di offrire uno strumento che consenta, volontariamente, l'invio periodico delle condizioni di salute delle persone registrate, consentendo l'incrocio dei dati sintomatologici da parte del Sistema Sanitario Regionale.
<br>Il Servizio "Sicilia Si Cura" ha l'obiettivo di creare un flusso continuo e trasparente di informazioni tra coloro che sono arrivati in Sicilia dopo il 1 Marzo 2020 e il Sistema di Gestione dell'Emergenza.
<br>Le informazioni riguardano le condizioni di salute, l'insorgenza di sintomi del COVID-19, l'eventuale esposizione a persone contagiate e l'indirizzo presso il quale si sta rimanendo in isolamento.
<br>La finalità è chiara: mantenere sotto controllo le condizioni di salute di chi è arrivato in Sicilia per identificare rapidamente l'insorgere di eventuali sintomi, intervenire celermente per la cura e mitigare i rischi di contagio per la popolazione.
<br>Nel rispetto della Privacy del cittadino, "Sicilia Si Cura" non esegue un monitoraggio attivo, in tempo reale, della posizione del suo utilizzatore, ma costituisce uno strumento per la condivisione volontaria delle proprie condizioni di salute su base bi-giornaliera. L'inserimento dell'indirizzo attuale è, volontario a cura dell'utente: l'APP verifica soltanto che l'indirizzo sia nell'ambito di un Comune della Regione Siciliana.
<br>Successivamente, nel momento dell'aggiornamento delle condizioni viene inviata la localizzazione dell'utente, al fine di confermare la sua presenza in un Comune della Regione Siciliana.
<br>Il Sistema di Gestione dell'Emergenza avrà la possibilità di accedere alle informazioni ricavate dall'APP per meglio gestire la curva epidemiologica in Sicilia.

### Description
> COVID-19 è la nuova App di “Connected Health” idonea per il self measurement, la prevenzione e il monitoraggio dei parametri fisiologici, o ancora per l’assistenza remota di pazienti contaggiati da COVID-19.
<br>Per accedere al servizio è sufficiente ricevere un account dalla struttura medica di riferimento per l’avvio della sorveglianza durante tutto il periodo di isolamento forzato.
<br>COVID-19 coniuga insieme la più moderna tecnologia medica di monitoraggio parametri vitali con la comunicazione in tempo reale via messaging, chat, video e audio per coloro che sono in isolamento fiduciario o pazienti in sorveglianza attiva.
<br>L’App COVID-19 è parte integrante della piattaforma di Connected Health ADiLife e permette ad un utente di effettuare il self assessment delle capacità fisiologiche quotidiana, o ancora di monitorare parametri come temperatura, frequenza cardiaca, saturazione d'ossigeno, pressione arteriosa da dispositivi medicali wearable Bluetooth certificati.
<br>È quindi possibile monitorare in maniera semplice e intuitiva i più diversi parametri vitali, che verranno selezionati dall’utente, caregiver/operatore secondo le proprie esigenze. 
<br>L'App consente inoltre di inviare un questionario alla centrale operativa per comunicare lo stato attuale dei sintomi.
<br>L’App COVID-19 comunica con una centrale operativa da cui, nella stessa semplice modalità potranno essere fissati i limiti e le soglie parametriche che daranno origine, 
<br>nel caso di superamento, a messaggi, segnalazioni, alerts spediti ad operatori o utenti selezionabili, così come saranno opzionabili le modalità con cui comunicare con il care giver/utente (social network, SMS, mail …).
<br>Tutti i dati saranno disponibili con il trend storico e accessibili dall’App o dal portale ADiLife con il proprio account di utente. I dispositivi disponibili per le misurazioni sono termometri no contact, pulsossimetri, misuratori pressione arteriosa, elettrocardiografi.
<br>L'utente può visualizzare le soglie impostate dalla struttura di riferimento, i promemoria e il trend delle proprie misurazioni nel tempo.
<br>L'App permette, inoltre, di richiedere un consulto medico in videocomunicazione grazie alla piattaforma di video comunicazione WebRTC integrata. Cliccando sull’apposita icona si entra in video chat con l’operatore di turno, attraverso l’analisi dei propri sintomi 
<br>l’operatore sarà in grado di suggerire il medico con cui conferire e mettere in contatto per un ulteriore approfondimento e visita in video comunicazione dal proprio smartphone.
<br>Per maggiori informazioni a riguardo https://www.adilife.net/covid-19.
<br>ADiLife è la salute a portata di tasca.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br>Nella lotta all’epidemia di COVID-19, l’app aiuta a notificare gli utenti potenzialmente contagiati il prima possibile, anche quando sono asintomatici. Questi utenti possono poi isolarsi per evitare di contagiare altri, con l’effetto di minimizzare la diffusione del virus e velocizzare il ritorno a una vita normale per la maggior parte della popolazione. Venendo informati tempestivamente, inoltre, gli utenti possono anche contattare il proprio medico di medicina generale, riducendo così il rischio di complicanze.
<br>Il sistema di notifiche di esposizione di Immuni si basa sulla tecnologia Bluetooth Low Energy, creata per essere particolarmente efficiente in termini di risparmio energetico, e non utilizza alcun tipo di dato di geolocalizzazione, inclusi quelli del GPS. L’app non raccoglie e non è in grado di ottenere alcun dato che identifichi l’utente, quali nome, cognome, data di nascita, indirizzo, numero di telefono o indirizzo email. Immuni riesce quindi a determinare che un contatto fra due utenti è avvenuto, ma non chi siano effettivamente i due utenti o dove si siano incontrati.
<br>Ecco una lista di alcune delle misure con cui Immuni protegge i dati degli utenti:
<br>• I dati raccolti sono quelli minimi, strettamente necessari per supportare e migliorare il sistema di notifiche di esposizione.
<br>• Il codice Bluetooth Low Energy trasmesso dall’app è generato in maniera casuale e non contiene alcuna informazione riguardo allo smartphone dell’utente, tanto meno sull’utente stesso. Inoltre, questo codice cambia svariate volte ogni ora, per tutelare ancora meglio la privacy dell’utente.
<br>• I dati salvati sullo smartphone sono cifrati.
<br>• Le connessioni tra l’app e il server sono cifrate.
<br>• Tutti i dati, siano essi salvati sul dispositivo o sul server, saranno cancellati non appena non saranno più necessari e in ogni caso non oltre il 31 dicembre 2020.
<br>• È il Ministero della Salute il soggetto che raccoglie i dati e che decide per quali scopi utilizzarli. In ogni caso, i dati verranno usati solo per contenere l’epidemia del COVID-19 e per la ricerca scientifica.
<br>• I dati sono salvati su server in Italia e gestiti da soggetti pubblici. 
<br>Immuni non fa e non può fare diagnosi. Sulla base dello storico dei contatti con utenti potenzialmente contagiosi, Immuni elabora alcune raccomandazioni su come è necessario comportarsi. Ma l’app non è un dispositivo medico e non può in alcun caso sostituire un medico.
<br>Immuni è uno strumento importante nella lotta a questa terribile epidemia e ciascun utente ne aumenta l’efficacia complessiva. Per questo consigliamo vivamente di installare l’app, usarla correttamente e incoraggiare parenti e amici a fare lo stesso. Tuttavia, non c’è alcun obbligo di utilizzo. La decisione spetta soltanto all’individuo.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Ministero della Salute |
| **Website**  | [https://www.immuni.italia.it/](https://www.immuni.italia.it/) |
| **Email** | direzionesistemainformativo@sanita.it |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.
