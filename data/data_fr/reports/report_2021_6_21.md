## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Disclaimer 

This report has been produced independently of any parties and its only objective is to help anybody in better understanding how COVID-related apps work in practice (and compare to each other). The results of this report are limited to the specific version of the software used for running the analyses and on the various heuristics implemented in there. In other words, the results of the analyzers may differ depending on the time and modalities in which they are executed.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

### Description
> OpenWHO est la plateforme interactive de transmission de connaissance de l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS) proposant des cours pour améliorer la réponse aux urgences sanitaires. OpenWHO permet à l’Organisation et à ses partenaires clés de transmettre des connaissances pouvant sauver des vies à un grand nombre d’intervenants de première ligne.
<br>Avec OpenWHO, vous avez la possibilité d’apprendre à votre rythme. Visionnez les courtes vidéos de cours et testez vos connaissances grâce à des auto-évaluations où et quand vous le désirez. Le forum du cours et l’espace de collaboration vous permet d’être en contact avec d’autres participants et experts du monde entier.
<br>Conçu en premier lieux pour les travailleurs de la santé, les intervenants de première ligne et les décideurs, l’application est aussi une source d’information destinée à ceux touchés par les flambées épidémiques et les urgences sanitaires, ou encore à ceux qui s’intéressent de manière générale au travail de l’OMS en matière d’urgences sanitaires. 
<br>L’application présente 6 chaînes : 
<br>- La chaîne Épidémie aborde la gestion des maladies infectieuses et fournit des informations scientifiques pouvant sauver des vies.
<br>- La chaîne Prêt à Intervenir permet de préparer le personnel qui s’entraîne en vue d’un déploiement à travailler dans des situations d’épidémies et d’urgences sanitaires.
<br>- La chaîne Faites dans le Social se concentre sur les interventions fondées sur les sciences sociales et aide à communiquer avec les communautés affectées. 
<br>- La chaîne Préparation en cas de Pandémies rassemble des cours sur divers aspects de la préparation parmi lesquels la surveillance, les mesures de santé publique et la communication sur les risques pendant une pandémie.
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 offre des ressources d’apprentissage relatives à l’épidémie de la coronavirus (COVID-19) destinées aux professionnels de la santé, aux décideurs, et au public dans les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS (arabe, chinois, français, russe et espagnol). 
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 Langues Nationales offre les mêmes ressources d’apprentissage que celles disponibles sur la chaîne COVID-19 mais dans des langues nationales, telles que l’indonésien, le japonais et le portugais. 
<br>Les cours sur OpenWHO sont disponibles dans de nombreuses langues, y compris les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS.
<br>Téléchargez l’application maintenant, et rejoignez la communauté OpenWHO.
<br>L’application est développée en partenariat avec l’Institut Hasso Plattner et l’OMS. Le contenu d’apprentissage est entièrement géré par l’OMS.

### Description
> *** La solution COVIDOM n'est pas en libre accès et est UNIQUEMENT disponible pour les patients suivis par des services hospitaliers utilisateurs de la plateforme.*** 
<br>Covidom est une application qui permet aux patients porteurs du virus COVID-19 de bénéficier d’un suivi à distance (ou télésuivi) quotidien. Il peut répondre à des questionnaires médicaux qui sont analysés en temps réel. De son côté, l’équipe soignante sait comment le patient vit au quotidien et est alertée si le patient a besoin d’une attention plus particulière. En cas de besoin, le personnel soignant prend le relais et rentre en contact directement avec le patient pour lui donner ses consignes.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de paris (AP-HP) |
| **Website**  | [https://www.covidom.fr](https://www.covidom.fr) |
| **Email** | contact.devmobile@aphp.fr |
| **Physical address**  | [AP-HP / DSI / WIND 33 bd de Picpus 75012 Paris France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/AP-HP%20/%20DSI%20/%20WIND%2033%20bd%20de%20Picpus%2075012%20Paris%20France) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> L'application TousAntiCovid est destinée au territoire français.
<br>Vous pouvez désormais créer et sauvegarder vos attestations de déplacement dérogatoire directement dans l'application.
<br>Protégeons nos proches, protégeons-nous et protégeons les autres. 
<br>TousAntiCovid, c’est simple :
<br># J'active l'application
<br>En utilisant le Bluetooth de votre téléphone, TousAntiCovid détecte les téléphones des autres utilisateurs qui restent à proximité du vôtre.
<br># Je reste informé
<br>Vous serez informé si vous avez été à proximité d’un utilisateur testé positif à la COVID-19. Vous serez informés des derniers chiffres et de l’actualité sur l’épidémie. Vous aurez accès aux conseils personnalisés de Mes Conseils Covid.
<br># Je protège mes proches et les autres
<br>Si vous devez vous faire tester, vous pourrez trouver le laboratoire le plus proche. Si vous êtes diagnostiqué comme un cas de COVID-19, votre laboratoire ou votre médecin vous donneront un code à scanner ou à saisir pour avertir anonymement les utilisateurs que vous avez rencontrés.
<br># Mes données sont protégées
<br>L’application n’utilise à aucun moment la localisation des personnes, et il est impossible de connaître l’identité des utilisateurs.
<br>Cette application a été réalisée par l'équipe TousAntiCovid, sous la supervision du Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé et du Secrétariat d'Etat chargé du Numérique.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gouvernement |
| **Website**  | [https://bonjour.tousanticovid.gouv.fr](https://bonjour.tousanticovid.gouv.fr) |
| **Email** | contact@tousanticovid.gouv.fr |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> L’épidémie de COVID-19 impacte nos habitudes de vie et nos rythmes biologiques. Le confinement et le stress actuel ont pu particulièrement fragiliser notre sommeil et modifier nos consommations d’alcool et de tabac, ce qui peut avoir des conséquences psychologiques négatives à moyen et long terme.
<br> 
<br>Dans ce contexte, l’unité SANPSY, le CHU de Bordeaux et l'université de Bordeaux, ont développé une application permettant de dépister des troubles du sommeil et d’évaluer sa consommation d’alcool et de tabac, afin de proposer un suivi et des recommandations personnalisées pour mieux maitriser son sommeil et ses consommations.
<br>Vous souhaitez savoir où vous en êtes avec votre sommeil et vos consommations pour mieux affronter les problèmes actuels liés aux déconfinement ? 
<br>Discutez avec Louise et Jeanne, nos deux compagnons virtuels, pour un bilan rapide de vos consommations et/ou de votre sommeil. 
<br>En fonction de vos réponses, des solutions personnalisées pour maîtriser vos consommations, et améliorer la qualité de votre sommeil vous seront proposées : des  conseils personnalisés à mettre en place et des outils de suivis (agenda de sommeil et agenda de consommations).
<br>Vous pourrez ensuite discuter de manière régulière avec Louise et Jeanne pour évaluer ensemble l'évolution de votre sommeil et de vos consommations.
<br>Si, malgré cet accompagnement, votre consommation ou votre sommeil vous posent toujours problème, nous vous mettrons en lien avec un professionnel de santé de Nouvelle Aquitaine ou nous vous donnerons des contacts pour être pris en charge pour les autres régions afin de vous accompagner. 
<br>Pensez bien à suivre nos conseils qui mis en application peuvent vous permettre d’améliorer considérablement votre qualité de vie.

> Application très complète seul bemol Pas de possibilité de revnir en arrière si on se teompe.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 15:07:46__

> Bien mais !!! Si on se trompe sur les données entrée pas moyen de modifié très dommage<br> :date: __2020-09-15 14:29:27__

> Application fonctionnel. Je trouve juste dommage d'avoir alourdi l'application avec de la 3D qui n'apporte pas grand chose...<br> :date: __2020-06-23 23:25:34__

> Pour le sommeil c'est intéressant. Juste un bémol : c'est dommage de ne pas proposer des modifications des données. J'ai mal compris l'agenda ce matin. J'ai voulu noter mes horaires de cette nuit, ça me les a datées sur une date antérieure.... Sinon je suis curieuse de voir la suite<br> :date: __2020-06-03 09:34:35__

> Bien. Juste dommage que l'agenda des consommations ne soit pas intégré au truc. Avec possibilité de le remplir en ligne via l'appli...<br> :date: __2020-05-13 21:28:20__

> Application utile et agréable, la voix utilisée est parfaite. Pour le contenu, il faudrait juste prendre en compte par exemple que certains ne consomment que peu voir pas du tout la semaine et explosent le compteur le weekend 😅<br> :date: __2020-05-13 10:37:43__

> Une bonne application pour évaluer le degré de sévérité de ses troubles du sommeil, avant un véritable diagnostic. Elle propose de remplir un agenda du sommeil sur sept jours. En revanche, la partie sur la consommation de tabac et d'alcool est moins au point... Je ne fume pas mais j'ai consommé quelques cigarettes avec des amis, à de rares occasions. Et à partir de mes réponses, Jeanne a estimé que ma consommation de tabac était problématique et que je devais vite arrêter !<br> :date: __2020-05-03 16:27:10__

> Dommage qu'il ne soit pas possible de modifier la saisie si on a fait une erreur, et qu'il ne soit pas possible d'ajouter de commentaires par nuit pour savoir ce qu'il s'est passé dans la soirée (consommation d'excitant...) et les raisons des réveils<br> :date: __2021-03-17 11:17:58__

> Bien mais à améliorer. Dommage de ne pas pouvoir ajouter des commentaires lors de la saisie des nuits (raison des réveils nocturnes par ex). Conseils très simples et déjà connus pour les personnes souffrant de troubles du sommeil. Rien sur les hypersomnies, je dors beaucoup, apparemment bien mais je suis toujours fatiguée, aucune réponse ou proposition dans l'application, dommage. Un lien vers une prise de consultation avec un praticien serait intéressant (en visio ou physique).<br> :date: __2020-12-23 09:26:03__

> L'application vient de se bloquer aprés le 2nd entretien. Je n'ai donc pas eu le CR de l'analyse des données sur 7 nuits et des réponses au 2nd entretien. L'avatar reste à l'écran et plus rien ne se produit. Dommage. Je retenterai peut être en désinstallant puis en la réinstallant<br> :date: __2020-12-13 15:21:53__

> Très bonne idée que de pouvoir s'auto évaluer sans craintes de jugements! Malheureusement, lorsque l'on travail de nuit les réponses pouvant être apportés sont limités. Par exemple, concernant le sommeil, je ne peux aller au delà de 14h pour le réveil et le levé... c'est dommage. Nous sommes tellement nombreux à souffrir de trouble du sommeil et à vivre sur ce rythme inversé.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 09:53:15__

> Trop long<br> :date: __2020-11-29 19:34:58__

> Pas mal<br> :date: __2020-08-10 08:22:16__

> Il est dommage que l'on ne puisse pas marquer que on se réveille après midi.. C'est mon cas et du coup ça fausse mes résultats et ne peux pas m'aider.<br> :date: __2020-06-24 16:40:57__

> Bonjour, je ne trouve pas l'accès à la saisie dans l'agenda journalier des consommations, pouvez-vous m'éclairer ?<br> :date: __2020-05-07 21:39:49__

> Vous faites un recensement covid ou quoi ? Et les sous-titres pour les sourds ? Bugs de fonctionnement... Etc etc...<br> :date: __2021-04-10 12:59:24__

> Pour le tabagisme, peut-être faudrait-il prendre en compte le sevrage tabagique, par exemple, c'est mon cas depuis plus d'un an, je vape avec nicotine et je ne cesse d'augmenter le taux. Je sais que c'est le tabac et la fumée qui sont nocifs, mais je suis très souvent sur ma vape pour avoir "ma dose"<br> :date: __2021-03-28 13:29:52__

> Permet de faire un suivi sommeil, consommation tabac et alcool. Les conseils sont généralistes (température chambre, limiter la conso café etc) mais ne semble pas relever les anomalies évidentes (sommeil fractionné par exemple) ni conseil associé. Bug sur le suivi conso tabac au bout d'une semaine : lors de l'entretien, impossible de renseigner le niveau d'évaluation (entre 1 et 7) pour la première question.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 21:54:42__

> Appli très intéressante sur les données du sommeil. Par contre plantage au moment des conseils pour améliorer son sommeil. Re-essai plusieurs fois mais sans succès. Dommage car c'est ce que j'attendais le plus.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 14:14:19__

> Bonne idée mais on ne peut pas corriger les données quand on fait une erreur de saisie 😭😭<br> :date: __2020-12-09 21:55:32__

> L'idée est bonne. L'appli pourrait être plus développée. Si on oublie ou on se trompe dans les données de consommation impossible de modifier et de revenir en arrière. Tout est alors faussé. Dommage<br> :date: __2020-10-17 11:04:59__

> Première impression mauvaise L'assistant virtuel est très bien fait mais deux choses me gênent - on entre ses horaires de sommeil mais les périodes de réveil pendant la nuit sont limitées à une heure par nuit - l'application ne se ferme pas quand on clique sur "revenir en arrière", il n'y a pas de moyen pour sortir de cette appli<br> :date: __2020-06-24 07:34:38__

> Idée intéressante mais outil inabouti. Impossible de saisir correctement les heures de sommeil.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 11:19:25__

> Trop long, impossible de quitter, sachez qu'on ne note pas la durée pendant laquelle on est reveillé en cours de nuit, on attend 'simplement' de pouvoir se rendormir...ou alors il faut regarder son reveil....pas top...<br> :date: __2021-03-17 07:00:32__

> Problème de fonctionnement, dès que j'arrive à la page ou je dois donner des infos sur les horaires de coucher, lever.. je ne peux plus rien faire il est impossible de noter quoi que ce soit, malgré désinstallation et réinstallation.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 09:10:53__

> Mon commentaire ayant été supprimé, je le remets : pendant 8 matin, j'ai rempli scrupuleusement le questionnaire Au bout de ces 8 jours, le petit avatar conseillé de faire le point sur mes nuits, Oui et ? Rien, aucun conseil, aucune conclusion virtuelle de l'analyse, juste une récap de mes nuits Cette appli ne sert absolument à rien<br> :date: __2020-12-14 14:19:42__

> Je viens de terminer une semaine de suivi du sommeil et suis très déçu par les conseils. Rien de nouveau par rapport à la littérature journalistique : proposer en septembre une chambre entre18 et 20° quand la température de nuit, fenêtres ouvertes, ne descendent pas sous 22° c'est juste inapproprié. Respirer par le ventre OK on sais déjà. Pas de café apres 14h00 quelle nouveauté ! Une arnaque déguisée par le CHU de Bordeaux.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:25:13__

> Impossible d entrée les horaires<br> :date: __2020-05-15 12:07:54__

> Plutôt inutile<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:20:29__

> Ne sert strictement à rien pour les gens qui ont un réel problème de sommeil ! Donne juste des conseils que j'applique déjà<br> :date: __2020-05-02 14:14:38__
