For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Croix-Rouge française |
| **Website**  | [https://minutis.croix-rouge.fr/](https://minutis.croix-rouge.fr/) |
| **Email** | support.minutis@croix-rouge.fr |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Croix-Rouge+fran%C3%A7aise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Croix-Rouge+fran%C3%A7aise) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

OpenWHO permet à l’Organisation et à ses partenaires clés de transmettre des connaissances pouvant sauver des vies à un grand nombre d’intervenants de première ligne.
<br>Avec OpenWHO, vous avez la possibilité d’apprendre à votre rythme. Visionnez les courtes vidéos de cours et testez vos connaissances grâce à des auto-évaluations où et quand vous le désirez. Le forum du cours et l’espace de collaboration vous permet d’être en contact avec d’autres participants et experts du monde entier.
<br>Conçu en premier lieux pour les travailleurs de la santé, les intervenants de première ligne et les décideurs, l’application est aussi une source d’information destinée à ceux touchés par les flambées épidémiques et les urgences sanitaires, ou encore à ceux qui s’intéressent de manière générale au travail de l’OMS en matière d’urgences sanitaires. 
<br>L’application présente 6 chaînes : 
<br>- La chaîne Épidémie aborde la gestion des maladies infectieuses et fournit des informations scientifiques pouvant sauver des vies.
<br>- La chaîne Prêt à Intervenir permet de préparer le personnel qui s’entraîne en vue d’un déploiement à travailler dans des situations d’épidémies et d’urgences sanitaires.
<br>- La chaîne Faites dans le Social se concentre sur les interventions fondées sur les sciences sociales et aide à communiquer avec les communautés affectées. 
<br>- La chaîne Préparation en cas de Pandémies rassemble des cours sur divers aspects de la préparation parmi lesquels la surveillance, les mesures de santé publique et la communication sur les risques pendant une pandémie.
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 offre des ressources d’apprentissage relatives à l’épidémie de la coronavirus (COVID-19) destinées aux professionnels de la santé, aux décideurs, et au public dans les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS (arabe, chinois, français, russe et espagnol). 
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 Langues Nationales offre les mêmes ressources d’apprentissage que celles disponibles sur la chaîne COVID-19 mais dans des langues nationales, telles que l’indonésien, le japonais et le portugais. 
<br>Les cours sur OpenWHO sont disponibles dans de nombreuses langues, y compris les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS.

### Description
> *** La solution COVIDOM n'est pas en libre accès et est UNIQUEMENT disponible pour les patients suivis par des services hospitaliers utilisateurs de la plateforme.*** 
<br>Covidom est une application qui permet aux patients porteurs du virus COVID-19 de bénéficier d’un suivi à distance (ou télésuivi) quotidien. Il peut répondre à des questionnaires médicaux qui sont analysés en temps réel. De son côté, l’équipe soignante sait comment le patient vit au quotidien et est alertée si le patient a besoin d’une attention plus particulière. En cas de besoin, le personnel soignant prend le relais et rentre en contact directement avec le patient pour lui donner ses consignes.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de paris (AP-HP) |
| **Website**  | [https://www.covidom.fr](https://www.covidom.fr) |
| **Email** | contact.devmobile@aphp.fr |
| **Physical address**  | [AP-HP / DSI / WIND 33 bd de Picpus 75012 Paris France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/AP-HP%20/%20DSI%20/%20WIND%2033%20bd%20de%20Picpus%2075012%20Paris%20France) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> L'application StopCovid est destinée au territoire français.
<br>Avec StopCovid, participez à la protection de vos proches, de vous-même et de tous en étant alerté si vous avez été à proximité d’un utilisateur testé positif.
<br>Protégeons nos proches, protégeons-nous et protégeons les autres. 
<br>StopCovid, c’est simple :
<br># J'active l'application
<br>En utilisant le Bluetooth de votre téléphone, StopCovid détecte les téléphones des autres utilisateurs qui restent à proximité du vôtre.
<br># Je reste informé
<br>Vous serez informé si vous avez été à proximité d’un utilisateur testé positif au COVID-19.
<br># Je protège mes proches et les autres
<br>Si vous effectuez un test COVID-19 et qu’il est positif, votre laboratoire vous donnera un code à scanner ou à saisir pour avertir anonymement les utilisateurs que vous avez rencontrés.
<br>#  Mes données sont protégées
<br>L’application n’utilise à aucun moment la localisation des personnes, et il est impossible de connaître l’identité des utilisateurs.
<br>Cette application de suivi de chaîne de transmission de la Covid-19 a été réalisée par l'équipe StopCovid, sous la supervision du Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé et du Secrétariat d'Etat chargé du Numérique.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gouvernement |
| **Website**  | [https://stopcovid.gouv.fr](https://stopcovid.gouv.fr) |
| **Email** | contact@stopcovid.gouv.fr |
| **Physical address**  | [20 avenue de Ségur 75007 Paris](https://www.google.com/maps/search/20%20avenue%20de%20Ségur%2075007%20Paris) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gouvernement](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gouvernement) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellente et pas de peur de flicage au regard de notre pb actuel ! Parfaitement opérationnelle et pratique, aucune instabilité et elle demande de faire attention à la consommation mais ce n'est quand même pas si compliqué. Je recommande son utilisation dans la période actuelle et espère que nous seront plus nombreux à l'utiliser pour qu'elle devienne pertinente.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 21:51:30__

> Une application bien dans l'ensemble, simple d'utilisation. Néanmoins, l'application ce désactive beaucoup de fois et des oublies de réactivation sont faits.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 21:51:21__

> Pour l'instant je trouve que ça consomme beaucoup trop de batterie, vraiment beaucoup. Par contre côté protection des données, on peut difficilement faire mieux ! Et les quatre étoiles sont pour ça. J'attends de voir si beaucoup de gens la téléchargent, il y aura un réel intérêt pour cette appli<br> :date: __2020-09-22 17:43:47__

> Faute de mieux...<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:18:03__

> L'appli se stoppe une fois de temps en temps, c'est assez rare et l'icône de notification disparaît, il est donc facile de s'en apercevoir et de relancer. Je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi si peu de personnes dont tourner cette application bien moins contraignante que le masque ou le confinement... Bien moins intrusive que Facebook et autres...<br> :date: __2020-09-22 06:20:39__

> Bien. Mais obliger de réactiver après un passage en mode avion.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:50:48__

> Décharge la batterie plus rapidement<br> :date: __2020-09-17 14:20:07__

> Non référencée par Google qui ne trouve aucune appli utilisable en France malgré ce qu'il annonce. Résultat, ce sont de nombreuse applis d'arnaque qu'on voit à la place. Stupide de la part de Google qui vend ses pubs aux applis malveillantes.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 18:32:48__

> Application simple à utiliser. Seul bémol, obligé de réactivité l'application près avoir enlevé le blutoot. C'est une infime perte de temps, je le conçois, vu le temps perdu sur des réseaux sociaux inutiles 😉<br> :date: __2020-09-16 14:30:44__

> Bien<br> :date: __2020-09-16 08:41:11__

> Fonctionne bien, elle se désactivait toute seule au début mais ça va mieux maintenant, notification présente en permanence mais heureusement mon OS permet de la cacher.<br> :date: __2020-09-14 20:19:20__

> C'est bien de pouvoir la mettre en œuvre à la demande, ce serait encore mieux qu'elle n'oblige pas, quelques fois, à la désinstaller pour la réinstaller pour la lancer.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 13:47:46__

> Pourquoi, via son message d'accueil, l'application m'informe-t-elle du fait que je ne j'ai pas activée ? Dès le téléchargement j'ai fait tout ce qu'il faut !..<br> :date: __2020-09-21 17:09:19__

> Pb bluetooth pour la connection du tel dans la voiture et des écouteurs bluetooth depuis l'installation de l'appli. Alors je l'ai désinstallé. Dommage.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 12:39:07__

> Très peux utiliser donc inefficace Dommage qu'il n'y a pas la carte de progression du covid-19 et des zones ou le masque est obligatoire avec une petite notification vous devez mettre votre masque zone obligatoire ou nous vous conseillons de mettre votre masque zone a forte affluence. L'application doit gagner en interactivité. Pour être utilisé.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 09:44:29__

> Application simple, respectueuse de la vie privée et qui a le mérite d'exister, requérant l'usage du Bluetooth, mais qui plante très régulièrement, et notamment après des périodes de non utilisation plus ou moins prolongées. Seule solution : effacer le stockage de l'application, et donc recommencer le paramétrage initial. Au rayon des autres regrets : notification persistante agaçante et non paramétrable, absence d'interopérabilité avec les applications développées par les autres pays européens.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 18:25:38__

> Inconvenient : energivore. s'éteind régulièrement sans motif et il faut le remarquer pour relancer l'app: On peut passer des heures à croiser des gens avec l'app etteind sans s'en rendre compte.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 09:03:28__

> Mais pourquoi ne pas avoir utilisé l'API de traçage de Google & Apple comme dans les autres pays de l'UE ? Leurs devise : Pourquoi faire simple quand on peut faire compliqué.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 08:08:02__

> Application gourmande en énergie. La batterie est très sollicitée.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 06:55:05__

> C'est aussi la n ième fois que je crois que l'application me protège mais qu'en fait elle s'est arrêtée. Je viens de la désinstaller et de la réinstaller sans l'activer: je me serais attendue à avoir une pastille de notification sur l'icône pour me prévenir que l'application ne me protège pas, mais non, il n'y a rien. De même, on a une notification permanente dès qu'on active l'application, mais lorsqu'on la désactive, aucune notification pour prévenir qu'on n'est plus protégé.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 09:18:49__

> Comme le disent beaucoup, l'application s'arrête tout le temps (le mode avion mis un peu trop longtemps, ou un bug avec le bluetooth et hop ça marche plus). Alors au départ je ne voulait pas de cette notification permanente qui dit que l'appli marche, mais finalement on en as besoin pour les cas où ça marche plus. Et pour l'installation, les explication sur la protection des données n'intéresse pas tout le monde (il faudrait un truc du genre "Êtes vous intéressé par la protection des données?")<br> :date: __2020-09-15 21:37:16__

> La consommation de batterie me semble énorme (5%). Des optimisations sont à faire sinon petsonne ne voudra plus l'utiliser.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 16:07:21__

> Appli trop énergivore. 2h d'utilisation, 33% de batterie consommée. En mode nomade, je vais pas me mettre en quête d'une prise pour recharger 2 fois dans la journée.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 09:17:41__

> Appli utile (soyons citoyens !) mais un défaut majeur : comme je me mets en mode avion chaque nuit, il faut que je réactive l'appli tous les matins. Ce n'est pas pratique, cela devrait se faire automatiquement comme pour les autres applis. J'oublie 9 fois sur 10. Ce qui limite l'utilité... Corrigez ce défaut, svp ! Je vois que tout le monde ici ou presque dit la même chose que moi et... Aucune réaction, aucune réponse, aucune correction des concepteurs. C'est décourageant !<br> :date: __2020-09-18 07:51:05__

> Ne marche pas mouline mouline mais ne s'active jamais ???<br> :date: __2020-09-17 20:31:46__

> Bonne idée cette app mais impossible à activer. Je desinstalle.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 20:26:42__

Mais j'espère que je n'aurai jamais à utiliser cette appli plus en détails ! 😅 Ajout : j'ai désinstallé et réinstallé en coupant la connexion Wifi. Là, j'ai pu activer la surveillance (et j'ai réactivé le wifi ensuite).
