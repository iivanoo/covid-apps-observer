Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Croix-Rouge française |
| **Website**  | [https://minutis.croix-rouge.fr/](https://minutis.croix-rouge.fr/) |
| **Email** | support.minutis@croix-rouge.fr |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Croix-Rouge+fran%C3%A7aise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Croix-Rouge+fran%C3%A7aise) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br>L’application présente 6 chaînes : 
<br>- La chaîne Épidémie aborde la gestion des maladies infectieuses et fournit des informations scientifiques pouvant sauver des vies.
<br>- La chaîne Prêt à Intervenir permet de préparer le personnel qui s’entraîne en vue d’un déploiement à travailler dans des situations d’épidémies et d’urgences sanitaires.
<br>- La chaîne Faites dans le Social se concentre sur les interventions fondées sur les sciences sociales et aide à communiquer avec les communautés affectées. 
<br>- La chaîne Préparation en cas de Pandémies rassemble des cours sur divers aspects de la préparation parmi lesquels la surveillance, les mesures de santé publique et la communication sur les risques pendant une pandémie.
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 offre des ressources d’apprentissage relatives à l’épidémie de la coronavirus (COVID-19) destinées aux professionnels de la santé, aux décideurs, et au public dans les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS (arabe, chinois, français, russe et espagnol). 
<br>- La chaîne COVID-19 Langues Nationales offre les mêmes ressources d’apprentissage que celles disponibles sur la chaîne COVID-19 mais dans des langues nationales, telles que l’indonésien, le japonais et le portugais. 
<br>Les cours sur OpenWHO sont disponibles dans de nombreuses langues, y compris les 6 langues officielles de l’OMS.

### Description
> *** La solution COVIDOM n'est pas en libre accès et est UNIQUEMENT disponible pour les patients suivis par des services hospitaliers utilisateurs de la plateforme.*** 
<br>Covidom est une application qui permet aux patients porteurs du virus COVID-19 de bénéficier d’un suivi à distance (ou télésuivi) quotidien. Il peut répondre à des questionnaires médicaux qui sont analysés en temps réel. De son côté, l’équipe soignante sait comment le patient vit au quotidien et est alertée si le patient a besoin d’une attention plus particulière. En cas de besoin, le personnel soignant prend le relais et rentre en contact directement avec le patient pour lui donner ses consignes.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de paris (AP-HP) |
| **Website**  | [https://www.covidom.fr](https://www.covidom.fr) |
| **Email** | contact.devmobile@aphp.fr |
| **Physical address**  | [AP-HP / DSI / WIND 33 bd de Picpus 75012 Paris France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/AP-HP%20/%20DSI%20/%20WIND%2033%20bd%20de%20Picpus%2075012%20Paris%20France) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> L'application StopCovid est destinée au territoire français.
<br>Avec StopCovid, participez à la protection de vos proches, de vous-même et de tous en étant alerté si vous avez été à proximité d’un utilisateur testé positif.
<br>Protégeons nos proches, protégeons-nous et protégeons les autres. 
<br>StopCovid, c’est simple :
<br># J'active l'application
<br>En utilisant le Bluetooth de votre téléphone, StopCovid détecte les téléphones des autres utilisateurs qui restent à proximité du vôtre.
<br># Je reste informé
<br>Vous serez informé si vous avez été à proximité d’un utilisateur testé positif au COVID-19.
<br># Je protège mes proches et les autres
<br>Si vous effectuez un test COVID-19 et qu’il est positif, votre laboratoire vous donnera un code à scanner ou à saisir pour avertir anonymement les utilisateurs que vous avez rencontrés.
<br>#  Mes données sont protégées
<br>L’application n’utilise à aucun moment la localisation des personnes, et il est impossible de connaître l’identité des utilisateurs.
<br>Cette application de suivi de chaîne de transmission de la Covid-19 a été réalisée par l'équipe StopCovid, sous la supervision du Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé et du Secrétariat d'Etat chargé du Numérique.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gouvernement |
| **Website**  | [https://stopcovid.gouv.fr](https://stopcovid.gouv.fr) |
| **Email** | contact@stopcovid.gouv.fr |
| **Physical address**  | [20 avenue de Ségur 75007 Paris](https://www.google.com/maps/search/20%20avenue%20de%20Ségur%2075007%20Paris) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gouvernement](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gouvernement) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Lorsque l'on se rend compte après une balade que l'appli a planté, on se dit que l'intérêt est limité. Bref, une horreur qui ne valait même pas son étoile. Cela ne semble plus être la cas. Enfin! L'appli est réinstallée depuis 1 semaine. Elle fait le job en ce qui me concerne. (Je me méfie quand même)<br> :date: __2020-10-14 19:51:59__

> Apparemment la mise à jour du 15 09 2020 a désactivé l'application ! Que ce soit un bug ou un choix volontaire, c'est scandaleux s'agissant de santé publique. Combien de personnes se sont rendu compte à ce jour qu'elles ont une application supposée les protéger qui est désactivée à leur insu ? Pas étonnant que peu de gens l'utilisent...<br> :date: __2020-10-06 14:29:53__

> Bonjour, Je retrouve parfois l'application arrêtée ou "désactivée". Ill suffit de la réactiver, mais combien de temps a été perdu ? Il semble que cela soit arrivé après sortie du mode avion. J'espère aussi que la désactivation ne fait pas perdre l'historique des deux dernières semaines, sinon, tout cela devient assez inutile. Et cette interrogation n'aide pas à avoir confiance. Il manque drastiquement un affichage statistique, par exemple un histogramme du nombre de contacts par jour. Merci<br> :date: __2020-10-04 15:39:17__

> J'ai installé cette application il y a plusieurs semaines et je me rends compte seulement aujourd'hui qu'elle n'était pas activée. Sur mon smartphone, un One+ 5T sous Android 10, le bouton d'aide pour l'activation ne renvoie pas vers le bon menu. Il faut aller dans paramètres > bluetooth > re-clicker sur bluetooth même si celui-ci est activé > activer option : "visible par appareils bluetooth à proximité"<br> :date: __2020-10-12 20:26:18__

> Je viens de l'installer sans aucun problème, mais je reçois des alertes fréquentes ( toutes les 2~3 min ) lorsque j'utilise mon smartphone pour me dire que StopCovid est activé, j'avoue c'est un peu usant à force. Y a t- il moyen de supprimer cette notification ? Mise à jour avis le 11/10/2020 Le défaut des alertes fréquentes avait été résolu, en revanche ces derniers jours il était impossible d'activer l 'appli. Le bouton était grisé. J'ai du désintaller puis réinstaller l'appli.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 09:14:23__

> De nouveau après MAJ 1.1.4 du 15/09 .. Se désactive seule en permanence malgré toutes les autorisations voulues. Version précédente le problème était déjà présent.

> Bizarre, l'application s'arrête sans crier gare, depuis plusieurs mois ce genre de Blague arrive régulièrement. Et là cette semaine, c'est le pompon : elle ne démarre plus du tout.
