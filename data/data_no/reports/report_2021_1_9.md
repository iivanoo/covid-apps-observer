# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:
| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------| 
| <img src="resources/org.who.infoapp___4.0.1/icon.png" alt="WHO Info icon" width="40"/> | WHO Info
| <img src="resources/de.xikolo.openwho___3.7/icon.png" alt="OpenWHO: Knowledge for Health Emergencies icon" width="40"/> | OpenWHO: Knowledge for Health Emergencies
| <img src="resources/no.fhi.smittestopp_exposure_notification___1.0.1/icon.png" alt="Smittestopp icon" width="40"/> | Smittestopp


The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Smittestopp er frivillig å bruke, og er et av flere tiltak som kan bidra til å forhindre spredning av koronaviruset. Smittestopp har 16 års aldersgrense.   
<br>Du får beskjed hvis du har vært i nærheten av en person med covid-19. Du kan gi beskjed til andre brukere av appen hvis du får covid-19. Slik kan vi alle passe bedre på de vi er i nærheten av. 
<br>Du kan ikke se hvem eller hvor mange smittede du har vært i nærheten av, og de kan ikke se deg. 
<br>Hvis du gir beskjed om at du er smittet, kan ikke andre se at det er du som gjør det. 
<br>Appen registrerer ikke data om hvor du er.  
<br>Takk for at du bidrar til å stoppe spredning av koronavirus. 
<br>Smittestopp er utviklet av Folkehelseinstituttet i Norge. Les mer om appen på www.helsenorge.no/smittestopp

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:14:27__

> Kjempe bra app. Ingen som helst tull og den er sikker å trygg å bruke. Den bruker ikke noe særlig batteri, i såfall er det så lite at man ikke merker det, bruker heller ikke noe særlig plass. Vi må få ned smitten nå så de kan vaksinere mest mulig så håper alle kan laste den ned 😉👍 del med venner så flest laster den ned.. vi alle vil ha en litt mer normal hverdag tilbake i løpet av året. 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br> :date: __2021-01-06 15:22:41__

> Bidrar til smittesporing med absolutt mest minimale konsekvenser for bruker. Bør tas i bruk av alle med smarttelefon👍<br> :date: __2021-01-05 21:49:03__

> Nå fungerer Smittestopp supert. Krever ingen handling. Last ned og den virker. Merker ingen ting på batteribruk. Alt anonymt, personvern ivaretatt. Håper så mange som mulig lastet ned denne, hvis ikke er det ikke noe poeng. Da vil ikke appen beskytte oss. Denne appen hjelper ikke MEG (individnivå), men OSS. Hvis mange nok laster den ned vil smittesporing bli mere treffsikker og viruset vil presses tilbake.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 22:23:43__

> Fungerer nå OK. Ta den i bruk! Strømforbruket virker greit.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:23:29__

> Fungerer fint, og bruker lite batteri<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:22:56__

> Supert hjelpemiddel! 👍🏻<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:18:07__

> Fungerer veldi bra 🙂🙂🙂<br> :date: __2020-12-30 09:20:11__

> Smittestopp leverer superbra på brukervennlighet, personvern og funksjonalitet. Verken mer eller mindre enn hva man trenger for smittestopp. Appen maser kanskje litt vel ofte med å sjekke kontaktaktiviteter. Tommel opp herfra!<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:15:45__

> Denne nye appen gjør alt rett. Hilsen it-student<br> :date: __2020-12-29 18:30:36__

> Det at forrige versjon både brukte Bluetooth og GPS var grunnen til at jeg ikke brukte den siden det tømte batteriet på rekordtid. Men ettersom denne versjonen kun bruker Bluetooth er det grunnen til at jeg installerte denne nye versjonen.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 09:57:26__

> Lydvarsel må gjøres om til opt-in av hensyn til de som ikke får til å slå av lyd som standard på enheten. Det må også rettes et par utrolig irriterende feil i skjermvarselet, nå "Smittestopp undersøker om du vær i nærheten av brukere som har m..." - "vær" skal antagelig være "har vært", del av meldingen er usynlig og hele meldingen forsvinner så fort at det ikke er mulig å få lest den en første gang.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 13:08:08__

> Appen er nå som den burde vært i våres. Men den viser en notifilasjon noe ala Sjekker status for smittemeldinger eller noe sånt. Da vibrerer telefonen og jeg får opp notifikasjon. Får hjerte i halsen hver gang når jeg ser det er en notifikasjon fra smottestopp appen. Hadde vært fint å kunne skjule disse. Får også daglig beskjed om å åpne appen for å reaktivere den. Har lagt den inn som unntak på batterisparing uten at det hjalp (Oneplus Nord).<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:50:41__

> Alt i alt mye bedre, men kommer konstant opp varsel om at den samler info. Ekstremt plagsomt! Dette må dere fikse!<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:48:58__

> Kan dere endre den irriterende skrivefeilen som står i varselet som kommer på toppen av skjermen? Det står "Smittestopp sjekker om du vær i nærheten av..."<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:33:55__

> Åpen kildekode. Personvernet ivaretatt på en genial måte. Bravo. Bluetooth-samtaler i bil fungerer dårlig sammen med denne appen.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 01:03:47__

> Helt greie spørsmål<br> :date: __2020-12-25 19:21:16__

> Bruker litt mer strøm når det er mange mobiler rundt deg, f. Eks. På shoppingsenter men mye bedre enn den forrige utgaven<br> :date: __2020-12-24 09:14:50__

> Appen virker grei men på Android kommer den av og til med et varsel øverst som bare forsvinner, det er ikke mulig å lese hva den sier fordi teksten bare forsvinner igjen<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:06:29__

> Vi prøver igjen. Appen vil fornye enhetens anonyme kode hvert 15 minutt står det. Kan smittede bli innmeldt i retrospekt og hvor mange kontakter vil innmeldes? Vi vil vite mer om funksjonen.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:51:54__

> Appen fungerer. Men det er jo bare 1% av nordmenn som bruker den. Så det er helt bortkastet. Dette fikk de ikke til da det gjaldt. Akkurat som resten av smittevernet.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:27:43__

> Liker ikke at posisjonstjenesten i Android må skrus på for at appen skal aktiveres (i tillegg til bluetooth). Det betyr at alle andre apper på telefonen får mulighet til å bruke posisjonstjenesten også. Jeg er bekymret for personvernet når jeg gir alle apper mulighet til å overvåke lokasjonen min. Har alltid posisjonstjenesten skrudd av, med mindre jeg trenger den for å se i et kart e.l.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:14:07__

> Finn app, men den bruker alt for mye strøm selv når man ikke har den aktiv eller Bluetooth på. Så den virker ikke helt optimal på hvordan den henter informasjon i bakgrunnen, om i det hele tatt det burde skje på appen enn server da(?)<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:36:13__

> Den funket bra i et døgn. Nå maser den om Bluetooth hele tiden og sier at jeg må skru den på, selv om den har stått på hele tiden. Vær så snill og fiks denne feilen. Er meget irriterende.. avinstallerer appen til dere har fikset det!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:23:50__

> Får varsel flere ganger i døgnet uten at det er noen meldinger. Burde være lydløs bortsett fra når man må teste seg.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 19:24:38__

> Får varsler av og til fra appen. Disse får jeg ikke lest. Dem bare forsvinner. Fix...<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:32:42__

> Har fått problemer med min Sense etter at jeg installerte den nye Smittestopp. Måtte deaktivere appen for å kunne synke Sense.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 19:34:55__

> Bruker for mye strøm på enheten.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:19:41__

> Avinstallert denne fordi den har for mange varslinger. Håpa den skulle kjøre i bakgrunnen uten å plage meg i det hele tatt med mindre det var fare for smitte. Her kommer det notifikasjoner minst 4 ganger om dagen.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 22:36:31__

> Jeg er fornøyd med personvernfirbedringene, neb noen ting som er uheldig med den nye appen: 1. Jeg er sjeldent under 2 meter fra noen i 15 minutter. Jeg syns eksponeringstiden ødelegger for at denne vil hjelpe med smittesporing. 2. Aldersgrense på 16 år virker imot sin hensikt nå som det ikke er registrering før smitte er sannsynlig. 3. En gang om dagen får jeg notifikasjon at Smittestopp er inaktiv og vil ikke virke før jeg trykker meg inn i appen. 4. Unødvendig notifikasjoner hver dag.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:57:19__

> Et bra tiltak, nå med bedre personvern. Men bruker fortsatt latterlig mye strøm og forstyrrer med varsler i tide og utide. Rart at det er så vanskelig å lage en slik app som bare virker.....<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:53:06__

> Reagerer litt på begrensningen på 15 minutter, fordi jeg jobber i butikk og der er jeg i kontakt med kunder oftere enn med 15 minutters mellomrom. En kundekontakt på jobben min varer i alt fra 2 til 10 minutter så denne begrensningen er i mitt tilfelle ikke optimal.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:04:56__

> Ødelegge for mennesker som har blåtann og ikke minst er det ikke noe annet enn dårlig ide. Ubrukelig og har ikke hørt om base stasjon og telefon trenger jo nettverk og det er jo selskapet som Telenor og Telia som har muligheten for gjøre det riktig så det er ikke noe problem med noe som helst. Men jeg har ikke med meg telefon ut så det er ikke noe som tilsier at jeg har bruk for den. Men det er ikke noe annet enn dårlig arbeid igjen og igjen takk for at dere er så utrolig dårlig med få det til?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:12:41__

> Må aktiveres manuelt hver dag. Får ett varsel i toppen av skjermen. Må da være mulig å automatisere dette i appen? Telefon: OnePlus 7T.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:58:16__

> Umulig å laste ned på telefonen<br> :date: __2020-12-29 08:16:52__

> Har OnePlus Nord med Android 10 og Freedome VPN. Smittestopp vil ikke virke med Bluetooth aktivert. Må også slå av wifi hjemme da programmet trenger mobildata. Hva gjør jeg med dette?<br> :date: __2020-12-23 01:11:01__

> Anbefale datatilsynet å ta en ekstra titt på dette her. Bruk av bluetooth kan spores. NEI jeg godtar IKKE at det sendes til Google, Apple osv brudd av personvern er dette. Å bruke bluetooth sørger også for at mobilen din sluker strøm så du er nødt til å ha den i laderen hele tiden. Da du kan spores og avlegger id. Nei hold dere langt unna det er akkurat det samme som den første appen bare dem skjuler sannheten at du kan trackes via bluetooth også. Dette er en SKAM. Misbruk av personvern.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 00:33:48__
