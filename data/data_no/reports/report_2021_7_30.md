# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

| <img src="resources/no.fhi.smittestopp_exposure_notification___2.2.1/icon.png" alt="Smittestopp icon" width="40"/> | Smittestopp


The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Smittestopp er frivillig å bruke, og er et av flere tiltak som kan bidra til å forhindre spredning av koronaviruset. Smittestopp har 16 års aldersgrense.   
<br>Du får beskjed hvis du har vært i nærheten av en person med covid-19. Du kan gi beskjed til andre brukere av appen hvis du får covid-19. Slik kan vi alle passe bedre på de vi er i nærheten av. 
<br>Du kan ikke se hvem eller hvor mange smittede du har vært i nærheten av, og de kan ikke se deg. 
<br>Hvis du gir beskjed om at du er smittet, kan ikke andre se at det er du som gjør det. 
<br>Appen registrerer ikke data om hvor du er.  
<br>Takk for at du bidrar til å stoppe spredning av koronavirus. 
<br>Smittestopp er utviklet av Folkehelseinstituttet i Norge. Les mer om appen på www.helsenorge.no/smittestopp

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Veldig bra, håper alle bruker dette.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 20:59:17__

> Fungerer flott. Kjekt med oppdatert statistikk direkte i appen.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 15:55:01__

> Fingerer problemfritt, ingen tap i batteritid og veldig få varsler om sjekk av hvor mange enheter den har vært i kontakt med.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 12:48:10__

> ALLE MÅ HA DENNE!!!<br> :date: __2021-03-19 11:18:04__

> Fungerer helt fint.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 11:25:38__

> Nødvendig i disse dager<br> :date: __2021-03-15 16:51:26__

> Fungerer problemfritt, tapper ikke mye strøm fra telefonen. Kjekt å ha:-)<br> :date: __2021-03-14 08:02:45__

> Virker være grei.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 10:01:52__

> Fungerer problemfritt. Ser det er mange som klager om hyppige varslinger, men jeg får ikke mere enn kanskje to pr. døgn, og de er så anonyme at jeg ikke legger merke til dem. Ser ikke noen endringer i batteribruken heller. (Har samsung S7)<br> :date: __2021-03-01 22:23:57__

> Smittesporing som ivaretar personvern på en utmerket måte! Det lagres minimalt med informasjon om meg som bruker, og det som lagres er kryptert og lagret distribuert. Genialt! Denne appen beviser at det går an å lage god og funksjonell teknologi uten at det går utover personvernet.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 10:57:12__

</p>

> Bra<br> :date: __2021-03-29 13:34:40__

> Men irriterende plinging, Bluetooth hvorfor? Hver gang jeg går til kjøkkenet eller ned 1 etasje til toalettet. Løsning: slå av pushvarsel. (Takk til S. Andersens anmeldelse nede) Men hvorfor ikke bruke denne appen til å gi info gjennom en link til FHI o.l.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 09:28:51__

> Fungerer greit så lenge man skrur av pushvarsel. Gå til innstillinger på mobilen og velg "Varsler". Finn Smittestopp-appen og skru av "Local notifications". Da plager den ikke deg med stadige pushvarsler, men du vil fortsatt få beskjed om du har vært i nærheten av noen som er smittet. "Local notifications" burde i utgangspunktet ikke vært påslått siden mange velger å slette appen i irritasjon. Det kan da neppe være hensikten?<br> :date: __2021-02-24 23:31:28__

> Nå virker appen igjen uten å kræsje.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 19:31:39__

> Bra løsning<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:16:39__

> Har Samsung 7s. Etter nokre veker stoppa han kvar gang han blei opna. Reinstallerte tre ganger, kombinert med restart av telefonen. Ved tredje installering, ser appen ut til å fungere.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:10:45__

> Bruker litt strøm, men det må man forvente da den bruker blåtann og WiFi.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 10:13:48__

> Ser ut til og fungere slik som ment. Ikke merkbart strømtrekk. Litt irriterende er det at det kommer lydvarsel når den oppdaterer.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 09:12:18__

> Betryggende.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:09:16__

> Virker bra...<br> :date: __2021-01-26 18:54:43__

</p>

> Hvorfor slår den seg av av seg selv?<br> :date: __2021-03-25 15:23:25__

> Appen nekter å la seg skru av, selv om jeg tvinger den til å stoppe med "tving stopp". Den maser om at jeg må skru på GPS og Bluetooth hvert 5. minutt og trekker masse strøm. Greit nok at jeg har den på når jeg er ute, men når jeg er hjemme trenger jeg ikke at den trekker strøm. Derfor avinstalleres den.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 18:10:47__

> Har satt pris på appen helt til i dag, nå sjekker den hvert 2. minutt om jeg har vært i nærheten av smittede! 🤷🏼‍♀️<br> :date: __2021-02-17 21:51:10__

> Appen er enkel og funker bra, men den har en veldig irriterende push-varsling på Android som jeg ikke får skrudd. Push kommer hver gang "smittestopp undersøker om du har vært i nærheten av smittede personer". Dette er selvsagt irrelevant for meg; men gi meg gjerne push om jeg faktisk har vært i nærheten av noen som har markert seg som smittet!<br> :date: __2021-02-13 18:08:44__

> Kommer med irriterende varsler mange ganger om dagen. Slike varsler burde være valgfrie. Vurderer å avinstallere pga. det.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 23:44:26__

> I begynnelsen fungerte den utmerket. Etter siste OS-oppdatering har jeg begynt å få varsel hver eneste gang appen gjør en sjekk, noe som til tider skjer flere ganger i minuttet. Bare mens jeg har skrevet dette har den gitt varsel 3 ganger. Jeg tør ikke deaktivere varsler fra appen i Android heller, i frykt for å ikke få med meg at jeg har hatt nærkontakt av den uheldige typen.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 17:19:06__

> Ett er noen dager.. slår appen seg automatisk av... dette er ikke helt bra<br> :date: __2021-02-09 22:29:15__

> Helt greit Men jeg forventa flere features som en enkel statistikk på Covid-19 i Norge generelt.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 01:03:08__

> Burde brukt wifi, ikke blåtann. Bruker nesten aldri blåtann. Betyr ofte inaktivert smittestopp hos meg og andre...<br> :date: __2021-02-04 09:51:11__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-03 16:32:31__

> Har ingen tro på denne app<br> :date: __2021-04-02 17:32:26__

> Prøver den ut,så får jeg se.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 04:48:58__

> Siste oppdatering gjorde at jeg fikk push-varsler hele tiden, dag som natt(flere ganger i min). Da disse ikke går ann å velge bort og tærer på batterier så slettes appen 😔. Synd egentlig.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 08:11:59__

> Appen i seg selv er grei, men er det nødvendig med varsel flere ganger i timen? Jeg vet at appen er aktiv, og jeg kunne forstått ett varsel i uken, men opptil flere varsler midt på natten?<br> :date: __2021-02-24 04:18:33__

> Appen er bedre nå. Jeg hadde satt pris på å kunne skrudd av lydvarsel (fann ikke noe jeg kunne endre på i settings etc) da det ikke er innafor å bli vekket av appen på en søndag omkring 07-ish.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 10:28:12__

> Ikke så mye å si om appen annet enn at konstante varsler om at appen sjekker om det er noen i nærheten er utrolig irriterende.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 08:13:12__

> 1. Til dere som klager over at den konstant sender varsler: dette kan fikses i innstillingene på telefonen, i likhet med alle andre apper. 2. Appen fungerte greit før GPS-kravet ble gjeninnført. Nå slukes batteriet opp i løpet av et par timer, og gjør appen bortkastet om man beveger seg utenfor i mer en halvannen time.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 15:18:02__

> Det er konstant varsling på at den sjekker om jeg har vært i kontakt med smittede. Dette må dere få fikset eller så gidder jeg ikke og avinstallerer appen.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 20:24:46__

> Fikk så mye pushvarsler at jeg ikke orket å ha den installert lengre. Det virker også som den drar en del batteri på at den kobler seg inn og ut hele tiden<br> :date: __2021-02-17 13:25:20__

> Appen kommer med meldinger om natten, og jeg våkner.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 11:37:11__

> Staten har vel aldri laget noe som fungerer. Bare søppel<br> :date: __2021-04-16 12:57:54__

> Mottar eksponeringsvarsler fra appen i hytt og pine. Telefonen varsler om eksponeringsvarsler mens den er låst, men når jeg går inn i appen så er det ingen nye meldinger. Dette skjer på daglig basis. Ikke til å stole på.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 21:32:31__

> Funker den egentlig???<br> :date: __2021-04-09 19:45:12__

> Ikke veldig bra eg har hatt appen og ikke blitt påpekt at, en som også har appen har gjort at eg måtte i karantene før smittesporing ringte. Så eg gikk flere timer uten å vite at en hadde vært smitte om, ikke denne personen kontakta oss. Så denne appen er ikke å stole på.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 22:22:05__

> Kan ikke legge inn positivt resultat. Selv uker etter positiv test. Så smittestopp brukes visst ikke til å stoppe smitte.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 06:20:28__

> Nok ett bevis på korona-svindelen. Sjekk verdensbørsen, der ligger fakta. Skam dere. Neste generasjoner blir barnløse. Sjekk innhold og hvem som står bak dette. Skremmende!<br> :date: __2021-03-26 07:46:36__

> Noe CDC I USA har i sin app, er at brukerne av appen kan gi tilbake meldinger om vaksinen, bivirkninger osv. Skulle likt en sånn app eller at dette kommer til denne også. Jeg fikk en sms fra FHI om å laste ned. Tror ikke denne fungerer... Ingen oppdaget. Verken hjemme, utenfor, i butikken, på kjøpesenter eller på gata. Ser ikke noe poeng ha den på tlf min.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 22:43:12__

> Har slått av alle varsler for denne appen(trenger ikke varsles når jeg er hjemme i egen bopel).Da kommer det opp på engelsk,unabel to check for exposures.Why???? Maser appen noe mer nå etter at allt er slått av,avinnstalleres denne.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 08:59:17__

> Denne appen fungerer ikke.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 06:12:39__

> Ikke bra app. Kan forbedres.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 18:14:46__
