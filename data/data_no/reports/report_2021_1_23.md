# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:
| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------| 
| <img src="resources/org.who.infoapp___4.1.0/icon.png" alt="WHO Info icon" width="40"/> | WHO Info
| <img src="resources/de.xikolo.openwho___3.7/icon.png" alt="OpenWHO: Knowledge for Health Emergencies icon" width="40"/> | OpenWHO: Knowledge for Health Emergencies
| <img src="resources/no.fhi.smittestopp_exposure_notification___1.0.2/icon.png" alt="Smittestopp icon" width="40"/> | Smittestopp


The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Smittestopp er frivillig å bruke, og er et av flere tiltak som kan bidra til å forhindre spredning av koronaviruset. Smittestopp har 16 års aldersgrense.   
<br>Du får beskjed hvis du har vært i nærheten av en person med covid-19. Du kan gi beskjed til andre brukere av appen hvis du får covid-19. Slik kan vi alle passe bedre på de vi er i nærheten av. 
<br>Du kan ikke se hvem eller hvor mange smittede du har vært i nærheten av, og de kan ikke se deg. 
<br>Hvis du gir beskjed om at du er smittet, kan ikke andre se at det er du som gjør det. 
<br>Appen registrerer ikke data om hvor du er.  
<br>Takk for at du bidrar til å stoppe spredning av koronavirus. 
<br>Smittestopp er utviklet av Folkehelseinstituttet i Norge. Les mer om appen på www.helsenorge.no/smittestopp

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Godt at det er hjelp å få.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:20:10__

> Bra app! La den bruke så mye strøm den bare ønsker, så lenge den hjelper oss i kampen mot corona. Helt naturlig at en slik app bruker noe strøm når den er aktiv på steder hvor det er mange mennesker. Flott tiltak dette!<br> :date: __2021-01-20 10:23:43__

> Absolutt informativt<br> :date: __2021-01-19 21:55:15__

> EDIT 17. JAN: Appen er normal igjen og fungerer knirkefritt for denne brukeren. :) Gammel: Fra ca. midnatt onsdag 13. Januar har appen begynt å ligge konstant fram med varsel (tidl. dukket det opp av og til), og jeg får opp advarsel fra mobilen om at den tapper mye strøm (Huawei P20, hele tiden med manuellstyrt strøminstilling for Smittestopp - all strømsparing/kontroll avslått for appen, den styrer fritt).<br> :date: __2021-01-17 17:46:40__

> Funker, trekker ikke merkbart mye strøm og varsler om Bluetooth ikke er på<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:24:10__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:14:27__

> Kjempe bra app. Ingen som helst tull og den er sikker å trygg å bruke. Den bruker ikke noe særlig batteri, i såfall er det så lite at man ikke merker det, bruker heller ikke noe særlig plass. Vi må få ned smitten nå så de kan vaksinere mest mulig så håper alle kan laste den ned 😉👍 del med venner så flest laster den ned.. vi alle vil ha en litt mer normal hverdag tilbake i løpet av året. 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br> :date: __2021-01-06 15:22:41__

> Bidrar til smittesporing med absolutt mest minimale konsekvenser for bruker. Bør tas i bruk av alle med smarttelefon👍<br> :date: __2021-01-05 21:49:03__

> Nå fungerer Smittestopp supert. Krever ingen handling. Last ned og den virker. Merker ingen ting på batteribruk. Alt anonymt, personvern ivaretatt. Håper så mange som mulig lastet ned denne, hvis ikke er det ikke noe poeng. Da vil ikke appen beskytte oss. Denne appen hjelper ikke MEG (individnivå), men OSS. Hvis mange nok laster den ned vil smittesporing bli mere treffsikker og viruset vil presses tilbake.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 22:23:43__

> Fungerer nå OK. Ta den i bruk! Strømforbruket virker greit.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:23:29__

</p>

> Virker som de har knekt koden. Alle forholdsregler tatt. Men redd det er så mange forholdsregler og begrensninger at det begrenser smittesporinga. Men alle bør ha denne da kan løse problemet og restriksjoner. For korte frister og for rask utvikling gjorde at det var umulig for norske utviklere å levere eller konkurrere, bare mulig å lage en norsk kopi av den danske appen. Den første appen var kanskje bedre egentlig, men problemene fra den første er løst.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 08:15:08__

> Listen up! Veldig bra jobba med appen synes jeg, dvs jeg synes appen innfrir på de fleste punkter som har vært oppe i media, og det håper jeg folk flest gjør også (burde i alle fall). En liten ting: Kan dere sjekke bluetooth funksjonalitet. Opplever en del mas om å måtte aktivere sporing/må skru på BT osv, selv om jeg har gjort det mange ganger. Sikkert enkelt å fikse, bare å spørre hvis dere trenger litt mer input/hjelp. mvh Vidar Vestnes 🤗<br> :date: __2021-01-17 18:29:59__

> Enkel i bruk, men føler meg ikke trygg på at den virker etter at den har hengt seg opp i "Smittestopp henter informasjon" Prøvde å restarte telefonen, men det samme skjedde igjen.... OPPDATERING: Appen er fikset, så jeg øker til 4 stjerner 😊<br> :date: __2021-01-16 11:44:38__

> Mye bedre personvern enn den forrige. Den her kan jeg se poenget med å laste ned, selv om den kommer noe sent.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:04:05__

> Infomeldingene på toppen er for lange setninger slik at man ikke får lest slutten. Ellers bra. Bruker Sony Experia Android. Ta kontakt om skjermbilder trengs.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:30:20__

> Push varsling har begynt å henge seg de siste dagene. Så må inn å deaktivert og aktivere varsling igjen for å få den bort eller restarte tlf. Håper dere får sett på denne feilen. Har Huawei P30 pro. Ellers fornøyd.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:09:27__

> Lydvarsel må gjøres om til opt-in av hensyn til de som ikke får til å slå av lyd som standard på enheten. Det må også rettes et par utrolig irriterende feil i skjermvarselet, nå "Smittestopp undersøker om du vær i nærheten av brukere som har m..." - "vær" skal antagelig være "har vært", del av meldingen er usynlig og hele meldingen forsvinner så fort at det ikke er mulig å få lest den en første gang. Edit 13/1: nå har et skjermvarsel hengt i ti timer...<br> :date: __2021-01-13 15:54:47__

> "Smittestopp henter informasjon" pushvarslet blit hengende fast. går ikke bort<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:30:14__

> Virker som om den har begynt å henge seg litt opp? Iallfall så står disse varslene som før gikk bort etter kort tid, der leeenge nå, flere timer faktisk, og det er prikk på appen som ikke går bort, får ikke vekk varselet heller. Og så har jeg fått beskjed om at den tar en del batteri, hindrer enheten å hvile, står det nå. Og at den bruker 18%av batteriet. Må plutselig lade mye oftere enn i begynnelsen også. På tide med en oppdatering kanskje? Ellers bra app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:17:53__

> Varsler hele tiden. Siste sync tok mange timer. Har jeg vært i faresonen, ja eller nei? Hvis nei, si det da, og la meg være i fred. Folk slutter å bry seg om varsler når de stadig dukker opp uten at noe har skjedd. Ellers et positivt tiltak. Håper den faktisk fanger opp noe.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 08:45:21__

> Tar merkbart mye krefter fra mobilen. Blir herved kun brukt ved bybesøk.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 00:07:31__

> Appen er fin, men den kom ni måneder for seint. Ingen som bruker den og da er den unyttig. Synd dere dreit dere ut med den første.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 06:29:04__

> Appen og hele os på mobil stopper opp hvis jeg stopper app og midlertidig slår av bluetooth.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 11:24:53__

> Ser ut som den ikke oppdaterer evt nærkontakter før man slår av og på telefonen. Pushvarselet blir "hengende" fast og går ikke an å sveipe bort.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 10:44:51__

> Forstyrrer for Chromecast<br> :date: __2021-01-10 14:46:27__

> Appen fungerer. Men det er jo bare 1% av nordmenn som bruker den. Så det er helt bortkastet. Dette fikk de ikke til da det gjaldt. Akkurat som resten av smittevernet.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:27:43__

> Liker ikke at posisjonstjenesten i Android må skrus på for at appen skal aktiveres (i tillegg til bluetooth). Det betyr at alle andre apper på telefonen får mulighet til å bruke posisjonstjenesten også. Jeg er bekymret for personvernet når jeg gir alle apper mulighet til å overvåke lokasjonen min. Har alltid posisjonstjenesten skrudd av, med mindre jeg trenger den for å se i et kart e.l.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:14:07__

> Finn app, men den bruker alt for mye strøm selv når man ikke har den aktiv eller Bluetooth på. Så den virker ikke helt optimal på hvordan den henter informasjon i bakgrunnen, om i det hele tatt det burde skje på appen enn server da(?)<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:36:13__

> Den funket bra i et døgn. Nå maser den om Bluetooth hele tiden og sier at jeg må skru den på, selv om den har stått på hele tiden. Vær så snill og fiks denne feilen. Er meget irriterende.. avinstallerer appen til dere har fikset det!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:23:50__

> Får varsel flere ganger i døgnet uten at det er noen meldinger. Burde være lydløs bortsett fra når man må teste seg.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 19:24:38__

> Funket bra på Samsung s10 med Android 10. Men etter oppgradering til Android 11 hengte varsling seg opp (konstant varsling). Ble noe bedre etter at selve appen ble oppdatert, men varsler fremdeles om uthenting av info hvert andre minutt. Utrolig irriterende!<br> :date: __2021-01-23 13:32:23__

> Den var grei i starten. Nå får jeg varsel fra Android ca en gang hvert minutt at Smittestopp henter informasjon, selv når jeg holder meg helt i ro hjemme.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:22:17__

> Den tømmer batteriet👎<br> :date: __2021-01-18 11:56:24__

> Høyt strømforbruk, henger seg ofte opp når den søker etter kontakt med smittede. Bakgrunnsoppgave, må reboote tlf eller tvangslukke app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 20:33:17__

> Ikonet går ikke vekk og den henter info til evig tid<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:56:01__

> Varsel har hengt seg opp på "Smittestopp undersøker om du vær (sic) i nærheten av bruker..." hele kvelden. Vanligvis popper det opp og forsvinner på et par sekunder, men nå har det vært synlig i varsel noen timer og lar seg ikke fjerne.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 23:54:44__

> Har fått problemer med min Sense etter at jeg installerte den nye Smittestopp. Måtte deaktivere appen for å kunne synke Sense.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 19:34:55__

> Bruker for mye strøm på enheten.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:19:41__

> Avinstallert denne fordi den har for mange varslinger. Håpa den skulle kjøre i bakgrunnen uten å plage meg i det hele tatt med mindre det var fare for smitte. Her kommer det notifikasjoner minst 4 ganger om dagen.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 22:36:31__

> Jeg er fornøyd med personvernfirbedringene, neb noen ting som er uheldig med den nye appen: 1. Jeg er sjeldent under 2 meter fra noen i 15 minutter. Jeg syns eksponeringstiden ødelegger for at denne vil hjelpe med smittesporing. 2. Aldersgrense på 16 år virker imot sin hensikt nå som det ikke er registrering før smitte er sannsynlig. 3. En gang om dagen får jeg notifikasjon at Smittestopp er inaktiv og vil ikke virke før jeg trykker meg inn i appen. 4. Unødvendig notifikasjoner hver dag.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:57:19__

> Nå ber appen meg om å slå på posisjonsfunksjonen i tillegg til Bluetooth. Jeg slår på posisjon kun når jeg bruker kartapper/navigasjonsapper, men ellers har jeg den avslått. Den forrige smittesporingsappen ble stoppet nettopp på grunn av at den benyttet posisjon. Hvorfor er det greit nå?<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:30:56__

> Har funka bra siden start, men nå hang den seg opp å søkte hele tiden. Forsøkte deaktivere, slå av bt, restarte telefon..... alt i forskjellige komboer. Men hang fortsatt der og etter at jeg slo av bt maset den i ett kjør om det. Ble såpass slitsomt at jeg ikke orket. Får prøve installasjon senere igjen.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:58:48__
