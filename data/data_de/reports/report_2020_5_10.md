# How to read this report

This report has been generated by the [covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) project. The project automatically analyzes the apps by extracting information which is already publicly available either on the web or in the apps binary files. 

Our analysis covers the following apps:

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Robert Koch-Institut |
| **Website**  | [https://corona-datenspende.de](https://corona-datenspende.de) |
| **Email** | info@corona-datenspende.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Robert Koch-Institut Nordufer 20 13353 Berlin](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Robert%20Koch-Institut%20Nordufer%2020%2013353%20Berlin) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Robert+Koch-Institut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Robert+Koch-Institut) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 


## Mentioned servers

> Keine Bewertung möglich. Hoffe hier kommt noch ein Update, die Auswahl der wearables muss erweitert werden. Update: Es hat nach einigen Tagen dann funktioniert mit Google Fit.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 07:27:40__

> Problemlose Installation und Einrichtung. Die App funktioniert fehlerfrei.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 01:09:22__

> Liebe Grüße an alle die sich hier in den Rezensionen darüber beschweren, dass die App nur mit Smartwatch genutzt werden kann. Eine Smartwatch misst ca. im 10-Minuten Takt den Puls. Was wollt ihr da manuell euren Puls eingeben?? 2x am Tag bringt für die App nichts. Dann für die Samsungnutzer: die App funktioniert einwandfrei mit Samsung Health. Sucht einfach mal im Playstore nach HealthSync. Zusammenfassend zu der App: Sie funktioniert einwandfrei. Sammelt die Daten und sendet sie ans RKI.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 10:22:32__

> Ich finde es gut wenn man somit helfen kann😀🤗<br> :date: __2020-05-06 12:20:00__

> Offenbar ist einfach nur etwas Geduld gefragt. Auch mich hat verunsichert, dass anfänglich keine Spendetage aufgezeichnet wurden. Inzwischen zählt die App aber fleißig, und so hoffe ich nun, dass die Daten zum besseren Verständnis der Pandemie beitragen. || Polar Vantage V + Samsung Galaxy S10+<br> :date: __2020-05-05 22:16:52__

> Es wird ein Wearble gefordert, nur leider nur wenige Hersteller unterstützt. Der Hersteller meiner SmartWatch (in meinem Fall: Denver) wird leider nicht aufgeführt, was ich erst während der Einrichtung merken konnte. Edit: inzwischen festgestellt: da ist dank Google-Fit doch noch eine Möglichkeit zur Kopplung, was nicht sofort ersichtlich war.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 08:08:58__

> Bei mir ließ es sich problemlos installieren, allerdings wurde alles 2x abgefragt.<br> :date: __2020-05-09 23:05:55__

> Die App gewährt dem RKI lediglich Zugriff auf die Daten des eigenen Fitnesstrackers ohne einen unmittelbaren Mehrwert für den Datenspender. Eine App wäre hierzu nicht notwendig. Die Daten können bei Fitbit, Google Fit u.a. auch auf direkten Wege frei gegeben werden. Ein bißchen Mehrwert für den Nutzer z.B. in Form von Statistikdaten wäre für die Akzeptanz der App sicher hilfreich. Aber was soll man von einer Bundesbehörden wie dem RKI auch anderes erwarten ....<br> :date: __2020-05-09 08:43:09__

> Ausser die Vitalparameter, hätte ich mir als Chronisch Kranker noch andere Parameter gewünscht. BZ, Blutgerinnung usw.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 23:11:30__

> Funktioniert seit 28 Tagen einwandfrei.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:19:53__

> Eigentlich eine super Idee - Aber... Ich habe ein Honor Band 5 und nutze dementsprechend die App Huawei Health. Diese ist leider nicht kompatibel mit der Corona Datenspende, was ich sehr schade finde. Ich konnte aber Huawei Health mit meinem Google Fit Account verknüpfen und diesen dann mit der App verbinden. Es werden aber leider nicht alle Daten genau übertragen, was - vor allem bei der Schlafdauer sehr komisch ist (9 H → ~5 H). Man könnte diese Kompatibilitätsprobleme Mal beheben. Sonst gut!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 21:04:30__

> Die App tut hoffentlich, was sie soll. Aber leider werden wichtige Anbieter wie Samsung Uhren nicht direkt unterstützt, was ich sehr schade finde, daher nur 4 Sterne.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 01:28:32__

> Tolle App, aber die Anbindung an Samsung Health fehlt.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 20:39:13__

> Seid einer Woche installiert, mit Garmin erfolgreich verbunden, bis heute kein Tag übertragen. Scheint wenig Sinn zu machen. Udate: Nach weiteren 10 Tagen keine Besserung/Veränderung, keine Daten werden übertragen. -> Nutzlos! Update: Mittlerweile geht's, wer hätte es gedacht! Geändert von 1 auf 4 Sterne<br> :date: __2020-05-03 16:51:25__

> Die Idee ist gut. Die Verbindung zu Google Fit funktioniert auch gut. Nur Google Fit ist nicht optimal.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 11:58:12__

> Mit Verbindung zu Garmin scheint die App nicht funktionieren. Die Anmeldung funktioniert zwar, aber es werden immer unter "gespendet" 0 Tage angezeigt - obwohl die App seit Tagen installiert ist. App läuft auf Android 9 Update: Jetzt funktioniert es einwandfrei.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 19:56:35__

> Sehr geehrtes RKI Team, ich kann die App leider nicht nutzen. Meine Uhr ist nicht kompatibel, nicht aufgeführt unter ihre Schnittstelle. Die Idee ist gut, sollte zumindest möglich sein auch nur über das Handy Gerät zu nutzen. Ich trage selten eine elektronische Uhr. Schade dass sie keine Statements mehr abgeben im TV.

> Durchwachsen und nicht mehr so sicher ob das App, mit meinen Daten vorsorglich um geht. Weshalb ich die Applikation wieder deinstalliert habe. Eine zentrale Corona App die mit vernünftigen Datensätze arbeiten, ohne Wirtschaftliche Interessen.

> Bitte samsung health hinzufügen. Dann kann auch ich Daten übermitteln.<br> :date: __2020-05-10 05:09:05__

> Gutes Aussehen der App. vivosmart HR+ von Garmin sammel die Daten und sendet sie zum RKI. Die ersten Tage hat dies nicht geklappt. Dann, ein paar Tage später wurde angezeigt, dass zwei Tage übermittelt wurden. Ein paar Tage später steht nun wieder eine Null dort. Ich hab dann die App deinstalliert und wieder einwenig gewartet. Inzwischen scheint es zu funktionieren, ich hab inzwischen eine 4 dort stehen :) Nach der 4 kam dann wieder die Null und die ist noch immer dort.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Deutschland verblödet. Erst testen, dann könnt ihr die App nutzen!<br> :date: __2020-04-23 03:33:32__

> 1. Die App ist sinnvoll! Für Menschen die getestet wurden und bei einer Pandemie logischerweise schnellstmöglich ihr Testergebnis erhalten sollten. 2. Fremdschämen muss man sich, wenn man hier die negativen Kommentare liest! Kann man solchen Menschen nicht einfach ihr Handy entziehen, damit sie keinen Schwachsinn mehr verbreiten können?! Einfach mal die App Informationen lesen und ein wenig nachdenken! 3. Die App HATTE Probleme mit der Verschlüsselung. Die sind mittlerweile aber behoben!<br> :date: __2020-04-23 01:30:02__

> Top! Hat alles super funktioniert! Super App! An alle die hier negativ bewerten, mal die Beschreibung genau durchlesen!<br> :date: __2020-04-22 11:33:23__

> Seher gute App<br> :date: __2020-04-19 09:57:06__

> Jede Stunde zählt. Über die app werden Patienten, die auf Covid-19 untersucht wurden, in Echtzeit über ihr Testergebnis informiert. Sobald der Befund verfügbar ist, erhält der Patient eine Push-Notification. Hoffentlich würde ich nie brauchen, wenn doch - freue mich dann dass so ein app gibt.<br> :date: __2020-04-17 17:29:42__

> Wenn man hier die Bewertungen von einigen Usern durchliest, kann einen nur übel werden. Besteht ein Großteil von Anwendern aus legasthenisch veranlagten Untermenschen? Ein Handy bedienen können, aber nichtmal auf verständlichen DEUTSCH eine Bewertung schreiben. Braucht man sich auch nicht wundern auf welch fruchtbaren Boden Hamsterkäufe und Fehlinformation gedeihen können^^... Zur App: Funktioniert und erledigt ihren Zweck, die Ausführung der appinternen Sicherheit ist nur sehr fraglich.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 07:53:10__

> Sehr gut, jede Stunde zählt, wie auch die Entlastung derer bei denen das Ergebnis bisher vmtl. Tel. angefragt werden muss. Wie man den Kommentaren Dritter entnehmen kann, muss man wohl noch einen Erklärbär einbauen der den Zweck erklärt, die App ist kein mobiles Labor 8:-)<br> :date: __2020-04-01 22:37:46__

> Hier sieht man Mal wieder, wenn man die Bewertungen liest, wie dumm viele Leute sind. Es glauben echt manche, dass die App ein Corona-Test oder so etwas sei. Es steht in der Beschreibung usw. Ihr müsst nur lesen und Mal nachdenken! Und dann wird die App auch noch negativ bewertet. Unfassbar, was die heutige Zeit so alles hervorbringt.<br> :date: __2020-03-31 23:30:10__

> Ergebnis wird mit noch immer nicht angezeigt obwohl ich es seit einem Tag kenne (telefonische Anfrage). Evtl. liegt es schon länger vor. Bei der telefonischen Auskunft wurde mir auch gesagt, dass das Ergebnis im System bereits freigeschaltet ist und damit einsehbar sein müsste. Also liegt der Fehler schon mal nicht beim Labor.

### Description
> Der Corona-Virus hält die Welt in Atem. Entscheidend für eine Eindämmung der Ausbreitung ist eine Isolation und schnelle Erkennung erkrankter Menschen. Aufgrund der Neuartigkeit des Virus ist es für Mediziner schwierig zwischen bekannten Erkrankungen und dem Corona-Virus zu unterscheiden. 
<br>Die App bietet die Möglichkeit über die Beantwortung von Fragebögen eine Selbsteinschätzung zu erhalten ob Sie an dem Corona-Virus erkrankt sind und ob eine Testung notwendig ist. Gleichzeitig helfen Sie über die App und die tägliche Beantwortung der Fragebögen den Corona-Virus besser zu verstehen und somit schneller zu Erkennen. Ihre Mithilfe kann Leben retten!
<br>Die Daten werden anonym und ausschließlich zu wissenschaftlichen Zwecken erhoben. Eine Rückverfolgung zu Ihrer Person ist nicht möglich und keinesfalls gewünscht. Trotz sorgfältiger Zusammenstellung der Informationen und Algorithmen handelt es sich bei der App nicht um ein Medizinprodukt und lediglich eine freiwillige Selbsteinschätzung. Suchen Sie einen Arzt auf wenn Sie dies für erforderlich halten!
<br>Stay home, stay healthy!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Coronika ist eine Art Tagebuch für die Gesundheit aller. 
<br>Coronika hilft dir zu merken, wen du getroffen hast und wo du gewesen bist, um eine Ausbreitung des Virus zu reduzieren.
<br>Für die Gesundheitsbehörden ist es essentiell zu verstehen, wo infizierte Personen gewesen sind, um Infektionsherde ausfindig zu machen und Kontaktpersonen zu kontaktieren.
<br>Ein kleiner, täglicher Beitrag von dir erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass du und deine Liebsten gesund bleiben. Trage ein an welchen Orten du gewesen bist und füge Personen hinzu, die du getroffen hast und trage so zur Eindämmung des Virus bei. 
<br>Einige Gründe, warum Coronika gut für dich ist:
<br>- Kontakte importieren: Erfasse, wen deiner Kontakte du getroffen hast oder lege Personen manuell an.
<br>- Orte speichern: Du fährst mit der Bahn oder bist im Supermarkt? Speichere Ort und Zeit einfach 
<br>per Klick.
<br>- Deine Daten gehören dir: Deine Einträge bleiben lokal auf deinem Gerät gespeichert und werden nicht weitergegeben. 
<br>- Hygienetipps und Erinnerungen ans Händewaschen: Verringern das Risiko, dass du dich mit dem Virus infizierst
<br>Wenn wir alle einen kleinen Beitrag leisten, hat das einen großen Effekt auf die Gesundheit aller und kann die Ausbreitung des Virus verlangsamen.
<br>Verfügbar in den folgenden Sprachen: Arabisch, Deutsch, Griechisch, Englisch, Spanisch, Finnisch, Französisch, Italienisch, Japanisch, Niederländisch, Polnisch, Rumänisch, Russisch, Singhalesisch, Türkisch, Ukrainisch, Chinesisch

> Sinnvolle Idee mit der man Symptome und noch wichtiger die Eintragungen zu getroffennen Personen um die Infektionskette nachzuvollziehen damit die zuständige Behörde mit diesen Daten etwas erreichen!!! DIE HOFFNUNG STIRBT ZULETZT UND WIR ALLE SIND SO VIEL STÄRKER ALS DIESES KLEINE BIEST DAS UNSERE WELT AUF DEN KOPF STELLT Das wird es lehren das wir keine Opfer-Beute sind sondern ein VOLK KEINE RASSEN NUR EINE MENSCHHEIT 😁👆<br> :date: __2020-04-15 14:13:38__

> Ich habe diese app bei mir schon installiert. Eine super sinnvolle sache. Auf jedemfall empfehlenswert. Grade in solch einer Situation.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 18:43:47__

> Sehr gut mit viel Potential. Sehr gute und selbst erklärende App mit viel Potential zur Aufzeichnung von Kontakten während Corona. Die Entwickler geben sofort Rückmeldung bei Feedback. Bei Aufzeichnung der Orte und der Kontakte wird einem erst mal richtig klar mit wie vielen Personen man täglich zusammentrifft. Danke für diese App und die Arbeit die hier drin steckt.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 18:25:09__

> Wäre gut wenn man die Ansicht in Wochen aufteilen könnte... ansonsten einfach und simpel<br> :date: __2020-05-07 22:57:54__

> App ist einfach zu bedienen (wenn man den Dreh raus hat 😉). Schön, dass die Einträge bei mir bleiben und nicht automatisch irgendwo landen. Zwei Wünsche hätte ich: 1. Es wäre schön, wenn man Gruppen auswählen könnte (z.B. schätzt man, dass 20 weitere Kunden auch im Geschäft waren). Momentan sieht es so aus, als wäre nur 1 Person außer mir dort gewesen. 2. Kontakte aus dem Import lassen sich nicht löschen (brauche z.B. nicht den ADAC in der Liste). Wäre schön, wenn man die auch “wischen“ könnte.<br> :date: __2020-04-19 22:22:06__

> Mehrere EU Sprachen wäre supi Bei Zeitangabe wäre gut z.B. ganztägig, vormittags, nachmittags<br> :date: __2020-04-17 21:53:37__

> Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit Tageseinträge Orte und Personen zu löschen. Nach Falscheingabe. Danke für die schnelle Antwort. Löschen funktioniert.<br> :date: __2020-04-09 15:17:45__

> Hoffen wir das es uns allen was bringt.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 20:48:06__

> Ganz ok, aber reicht nicht! Bitte eine Bluetooth Funktion hinzu fügen, die andere in der Nähe erkennt, die gefärdet waren sind oder sogar erkrankt sind. Diese werden anonym an die anderen Kontakte gemeldet... Ungefähr so arbeitet der Virus in seiner Verbreitung, schlagen wir ihn mit seinen eigenen Waffen...<br> :date: __2020-04-06 18:46:18__

> Ich gebe 4 Sterne, weil die App genau das macht, was sie verspricht, nur etwas zu umständlich. Ich führe selbst schon mit einer nornalen Tagebuch-App Tagebuch, das ist das gleiche. Der Grund weswegen ich mir diese App geholt habe war die Hoffnung, dass hier Informationen geteilt werden. In meiner 200.000 Einwohnerstadt gibt es weniger als 200 Infizierte und einen Toten, aber die ganze Stadt steht still. Sollen sie doch sagen, auf welcher Parkbank sie saßen und schon steckt sich keiner an.<br> :date: __2020-04-06 13:24:41__

> Einfaches und sinnvolles handling. Sicher im "Alarmfall eine gute Hilfe". Toll wäre noch eine Alarmfunktion, wenn in Region, Land, Bund neue Erkenntnisse oder Maßnahmen erfolgen. Nachtrag: Die Zeitangaben sollten Beginn und Ende beinhalten. Ebenso wäre noch eine Komentarfunktion hilfreich.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 13:06:05__

> Sehr interessant<br> :date: __2020-03-31 22:37:38__

> App ist eine gute Idee. Einige Bewertungen sprechen für eine Standort Freigabe. Könnte man in der App als Option einbauen. So kann jeder über seine datenfreigabeentscheiden. Seine eigenen Daten verbergen und trotzdem auf öffentliche Daten zugreife.der Nutzer bekommt Hinweis " infizierte Person war heute zu diesem Zeitpunkt auch dort" Ich war heute einkaufen. Wenn ich infiziertr wäre wüssten dann andere Nutzer dass sie möglicherweise Kontakt beim Einkaufen hatten. Das geht sicher auch anonym.<br> :date: __2020-03-31 12:07:35__

> Da ich im Krankenhaus arbeite, kann ich schlecht die Mengen an Personen eintragen, mit denen ich Kontakt habe und hatte. Muss erst mal schauen ob dieses Programm für mich einsetzbar ist.<br> :date: __2020-04-15 15:41:27__

> tut seinen Zweck gut gemacht aber leider beim automatischen hinzufügen von Personen manche Kontakte doppelt Freue mich auf neue Updates<br> :date: __2020-04-14 09:39:00__

> Siht gut aus dir app jest kann ich auch noch keine Person angeben ich selber wurde noch nicht getestet<br> :date: __2020-04-09 23:29:02__

> Für die schnelle Bereitstellung einer solchen App ganz okay. Erfüllt den Sinn & Zweck, einfach aber nützlich. Verbraucht wenig Speicherplatz, was bei mir auch immer ein großes Problem ist. Allerdings würde ich mir wünschen, dass man die Personen und Orte im Nachhinein noch überarbeiten oder Tippfehler korrigieren kann. Daran wurde, soweit ich weiß, nicht gedacht. Wenn das noch geändert wird, bin ich vollkommen überzeugt, kann diese App nur weiterempfehlen und gebe selbstverständlich 5 Sterne!<br> :date: __2020-04-06 13:43:10__

> Nette Idee, aber zu umständlich. Wieso kann ich nicht per GPS Orte in meiner Gegend auswählen, wie es bei Google Maps und einigen anderen Apps funktioniert? Was nutzt es mir, wenn ich einen Ort manuell benennen muss und nicht einmal gespeichert wird, wo sich dieser befindet? Optimal wäre ein durchgehendes Tracking. Man könnte dann an bestimmten Stellen anklicken, dass man dort "in Kontakt" war, von wann bis wann und wem man dort begegnet ist. Noch fortschrittlicher - und durchaus machbar - wäre es, wenn die App erkennt, ob man im Auto oder zu Fuß unterwegs ist und bei Fußwegen die Strecke als "potenzieller Kontaktbereich" gespeichert wird. Kontakte sollte man nachträglich ergänzen können und das Ganze sollte anklickbar auf einer Karte dargestellt werden. So würde auch das Problem mit Paketzustellern gelöst.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 14:42:31__

> Ganz gut soweit. Es wäre aber gut, wenn man im Nachhinein die Einträge bearbeiten könnte. Hab mich beispielsweise bei der Uhrzeit vertan und kann es nicht mehr ändern.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 07:32:47__

> Wenn ich noch meine tägliche Körpertemperatur früh/abends eintragen könnte, wäre es für die Kontrolle noch besser.<br> :date: __2020-03-31 08:10:58__

> Nun ja, die App ist nicht gerade gelungen.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 13:21:28__

> Die App ist für den Benutzer zu Umständlich. Es gibt Fahrtenbuch Apps die den Standort besser nachvollziehen und das automatisch. Zudem könnte man die Ansteckungszahlen des RKI mit aufnehmen und zeigen in welchen Gebieten man besonders gefährdet ist. Zudem könnte mir die App über Bluetooth auflisten ob und wo ich noch Kontakt mit Anderen gehabt haben könnte. Wenn ich z.B. einen Supermarkt besuchen möchte könnten mir die Zeiten angezeigt werden an denen möglichst wenig Leute dort sind. LG Guido<br> :date: __2020-04-19 16:53:27__

> Die meisten Leute mit denen man Kontakt hat, trifft man nicht bewusst, sondern zB im Supermarkt oder bei der Bank. Von diesen Menschen hat man selten eine Telefonnummer<br> :date: __2020-04-12 18:07:14__

> Das ist noch Luft nach oben an sich gut aber für die Orte braucht es google maps und GPS<br> :date: __2020-04-08 09:54:55__

> Wie kann ich das alles eintragen komme nicht mehr weiter<br> :date: __2020-04-07 15:35:07__

> Leider ist die App sehr rudimentär. Es stehen eigentlich keine Hilfen für die Bedienung oder zur Klärung von Unklarheiten zur Verfügung. Es lassen sich z.B. keine Orte finden, an denen ich mich aufgehalten habe über die Suche eingeben. Leider auch keine Erläuterung. Selbst die Deutsche Goßstadt, in Dr ich wohne wurde nicht gefunden??!<br> :date: __2020-03-31 22:43:45__

> Keine GPS Funktion, keine Verknüpfung oder anonymisierte Einsicht anderer Nutzer, somit nur ein lokales Tagebuch und Notizzettel und somit wertlos!<br> :date: __2020-03-30 04:18:23__

> Besser wäre eine automatische GPS Funktion was die Wege und Orte speichert Und Orte und Anschriften Verzeichnis inklusive<br> :date: __2020-03-29 11:24:40__

<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Top App, great functionality! Keep going! Alles funktioniert einwandfrei. Der Support meldet sich innerhalb von 24 Std sollte es Schwierigkeiten mit den Kursen oder Zertifikaten geben.<br> :date: __2020-04-19 18:46:48__

> Thanks Who<br> :date: __2020-04-15 18:56:24__

> Diese App bietet Medizinern und Fachpersonal die Mőglichkeit, sich umfassend zu informieren um einer Pandemie zu begegnen. Dafűr sollte man bereit sein, sich in die Informationen einzuarbeiten.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 20:16:47__

> Die App ist super! Übersichtlich und leicht verständlich. Ja diese App ist nicht auf Deutsch! Aber im Ernst: einer App schlechte Bewertungen zu geben nur weil man selber zu dumm ist eine der Weltsprachen zu lernen, ist schon ziemlich arm. Aber das ist halt Deutschland und seine Bevölkerung...<br> :date: __2020-04-14 12:04:35__

> Für alle "kein deutsch = blöd": da Deutsch keine führende Weltsprache ist, ist sie auch keine Amtssprache der WHO. Da noch keiner etwas sinnvolles nach deutsch übersetzt hat, sind derzeit keine Inhalte in deutscher Sprache enthalten... Ansonsten sind einige lehrreiche Inhalte vorhanden.<br> :date: __2020-04-08 19:31:11__

> Steht auch nichts anderes drin, als wir in den Zeitungen lesen können. Die deutsche Sprache ist nicht so verbreitet, dass es wichtig wäre, sie zu integrieren. Aber angesichts der Tatsache, dass sich Deutschland in der Infektions-Hitparade unter den Top-10 befindet und dass so Sprachen, wie Tibetanisch oder Türkisch unterstützt werden, ist es durchaus nachvollziehbar, dass es negativ bemerkt wird. Aber heutzutage sollte man schon soweit englisch beherrschen, dass man hier einigermaßen mitkommt.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 18:48:38__

> Leider keine Möglichkeit der Übersetzung in die Landessprache. Die inhaltliche Aufbereitung ist okay, aber alle Informationen sind in der seriösen Berichterstattung von zb. der Tagesschau App bestens und sehr aktuell abrufbar. Daher werde ich die Applikation deinstallieren.<br> :date: __2020-04-19 09:51:54__

> Schade das es keine deutsche Übersetzung gibt und auch in anderen Sprachen nicht jeder ist der englischen Sprache mächtig<br> :date: __2020-04-16 22:34:58__

> Unbrauchbar bitte in Deutsch übersetzen ansonsten löschen 😡 und dann ist jeder zu hundertprozentig gut Englisch kann Schulenglisch ist anderes wie richtiges Englisch sollte das bitte auch auf deutsch sein weil in Deutschland sterben die Leute ja auch und nicht nur in der Türkei oder Iran oder wo auch immer bitte auf Deutsch danke<br> :date: __2020-04-16 23:12:00__
