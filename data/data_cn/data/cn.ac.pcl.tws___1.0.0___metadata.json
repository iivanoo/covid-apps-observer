It establishes a time-series record database of person-to-person, person-to-thing contact, and accurately locates people who are in close contact with the infected. It helps the government effectively prevent and control the epidemic by tracing the transmission route and blocking the secondary transmission of  virus.After download and login, TWS can automatically sense environmental information without any operation. It records the contact data in current environment, including the user's location, the health status and the distance of contacted objects, and the time of contact. Users can query the contact record within the past 14 days and the health status of all contacted objects, estimate the risk of infection by themselves.",
