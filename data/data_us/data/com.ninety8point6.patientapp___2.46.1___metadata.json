        "Easy to use, quick and convenient for general medical care. Text based symptom reporting and conversation with providers.",
        "Great idea that is executed well. Helped me out of a primary provider jam and got my prescriptions and labs taken care of. Highly recommend.",
        "I have had the opportunity to use this app a couple of times. It's great being able to speak with a doctor instead of spending all day waiting in an office.",
        "Just great. Finally, something in life that is easy and just works as you'd expect... actually, even better.",
        "Very easy and quick, the Doctor was knowledgeable and we were able to get my daughter on a prescription right away",
        "I'm so glad my dad introduced me to this app - since I lost my job to covid, it's been so rough without insurance but this is affordable and I can get my prescriptions refilled easily. Heck, I feel like the doctors I talk to via chat here listen to my concerns more than any in-person visit I've had!",
        "I was so against these types of things, but my company got it for us. I have had a string of bad luck and have had to use this app twice in less than a week. It has been amazing, very fast, people always polite. It helps if you know a little bit about what's going on with you. I would definitely recommend this app,it has been a much appreciated option.",
        "The app has been great for me as my anxiety causes me to skip appointments or undervalue my care needs. Now I feel that I can get a quick assessment and medication without having to wait at an urgent care and can take care of my other commitments.",
        "I received terrible customer service from the 98point6 doctors during virtual visits on several occasions. They rushed through the visits, didn't listen to me or give me time to explain my heathcote concerns or needs. Their doctors ended the visits abruptly and signed out of the app before I could even finish asking them questions. Highly DO NOT recommend this app!",
        "This has been an amazing resource. Have not had a bad experience and have used it twice. Great.",
        "What's the point of getting charged $40 for a \"visit\" that's just the doctor telling me I'll need to see a doctor in person? If I could see a doctor in person, I wouldn't be using an app like this in the first place.",
        "This is supposed to be text-based. I logged in to try and get care for a simple issue. I got as far as entering my name and phone number before the on-screen guidance asked if a video chat was ok. The options were Yes or End Visit. This is a bogus program.",
        "Fairly agreeable app, I've not had trouble in the two times I've used it.",
        "This app is the best thing they've done with smart phones in A long time. The physicians I've chat with are all really nice and helpful. I don't have insurance and to pay 120 a year for this is life changing. They've helped with so much including mental health issues like depression.",
        "So far, I've had ONLY good experiences using this app. It's super easy to use and safer and more efficient than venturing into a clinic for things that can just as easily be diagnosed via text and photo communication.",
        "My wait time was only 2 minutes and the doctor was very attentive and asked the right questions and allow me to share what normally works best for me! It was a very pleasant experience and it took no time at all to get the help I needed!",
        "Takes a couple minutes to get through all the basic questions but its a great bridge and time saver especially on the weekends.",
        "This is a great way to avoid picking up unnecessary germs and possibly bringing those germs home to be spread around.",
        "I love being able to discuss symptoms with a Dr and they can help me with figuring out home remedies or if we need a trip to a Dr in person. I feel very confident in the advice they give me. It's a free service through my insurance and I really appreciate it!",
        "Faat and easy for simple things that you need quickly but would be a chore to do the traditional way.",
        "I love this app! It's very convenient and easy to use. All your questions and concerns are answered by a doctor. It saves time by not having to go to a doctors office.",
        "Quick, easy, professional. Great for little nagging issues that aren't bad enough to schedule an actual doctor visit for.",
        "Easy to use. Perfect to meet my schedule needs and each doctor has provided amazing patient skills.",
        "Excellent experience! Doctor helps you step by step. Would recommend this app who's insurance allows it.",
        "Awesome App! They can order medications but cannot schedule diagnostic exams yet.",
        "I had throbbing aches to the back of my right side of my head and times to my neck and tight shoulders to realize it could be a muscle strain.",
        "The doctors are always happy and helpful. It is quick and helps when you have those quick questions.",
        "This service is a joke. Happy to take your money and direct you to a real doctor for a real assessment. Wish I had thought of this business model.",
        "Doctor was great, app covered a whole lot of questions.",
        "So efficient and easy to use.",
        "I was skeptical of using this service at first. But when my Dr told me I had to wait till March to see him, I gave it a shot. Got an appointment within minutes. It was a nice hybrid text/video appt and very convenient. I needed a follow up to release back to work and that was done through text with the same Dr as before within 20 min start to finish. Will definitely use again",
        "This app almost seems to good to be true. Been using it a year now. Visit a doctor anytime, from anywhere for a dollar a visit (plus $120 annual fee) App works great and the doctors really listen. I love being able to talk to a doctor over chat. I don't have to worry about setting up a webcam, or family members overhearing the visit. Not a full replacement for an in person doctor, but for things that can be diagnosed remotely it's more convenient, and less stressful than going in person.",
        "Second time using i got help right away. Received doctors not for work and got medication prescription. as little as $30 for 3 months of subscription to 98point6,i would of paid over $500 alone for a visit to the doctors or emergency room",
        "Easy, quick, and very helpful!",
        "The first time i used this app was great...after that it was useless.. The drs didnt want to do anything to help me and suggested i go to a dr... I have no insurance and my normal dr is a low income clinic that takes months to get an appt at... And i cant afford an er visit each time i need a medication refilled... And it wasnt even a narcotic medication or anything along those lines... So whats the point of this app??",
        "Very easy and convenient",
        "So, take it for what it's worth, I have only used this app for 3 days. In those 3 days, I had 2 appointments, they are $1 each plus $20 to register. As far I know, that is the cheapest doctor's visit possible. I th I'll nk you can do telehealth for free with most insurance. This is essentially telehealth but, text based. I recently retired from 20 years in the Army and haven't been able to get my insurance (USFHP) to cover any health care since retiring. So, finding this has been a relief.",
        "Such a smooth process! I did answer some questions initially before talking to a doctor but it's no different than going to an office. The doctor was professional and courteous. I will definitely use the app again!",
        "Good experience overall. Though keep your symptom description to bullet point summary. It said \"in detail\" but my \"narrative\" description was timed out and I had to start the visit over.",
        "As someone without insurance, this app is invaluable because it allows me to access care that I need, including my asthma medications, antidepressants, migraine preventives, and sick notes for work! A three month trial subscription is only $30, and each visit is only $1. A year subscription is $120. Even if you have insurance, this app is a money saver \ud83e\udd70"
