    "comments": [
        "Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.",
        "I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.",
        "This app sucks, its slooow, buttons work at random, when they decide to work at all, I couldn't even get far enough in the app to completely describe my ailments. I DON'T RECOMMEND!! I uninstalled immediately after this review.",
        "I have found that searching for certain terms, such as \"dementia\", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",
        "A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!",
        "I love how it elaborate and explain. Its not just helpful but learning.",
        "I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled",
        "The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.",
        "This is such an app for info on medical anything. Including identifying pills that you find in your cabinet and can't remember or know what it is.",
        "Don't download, you'll get daily spamming. They don't accept unsubscribe.",
        "It's easy to find the right information you wand plus ways of helping you and showing ways to exercise to help with the problem 1 It gets my vote",
        "poorest symptom tracker, really irritating. even it cant find acne and pain? better you developers remove this fraud app, or make a proper diagnosis algorithm,, really hate your app.",
        "Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.",
        "I do like this app because I also went to the website on my computer. I do wish that they would bring back the old symptom checker rather than the new one cuz I do not like the new interface with it it's a lot harder to navigate than when you could just click on the body parts and then click on the subcategories and go from there",
        "It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays",
        "Good information and podcasts are good.",
        "Tried to give me results before I even have a chance to explain the symptoms. Useless",
        "Symptom checker seldom works properly. You're better off going to Google.",
        "I couldn't find some of the meds I take. I'm not sure if this app is aware of Canadian medicine terms and generic drug names. Uninstalled.",
        "This is one of the most helpful apps that I have ever installed on my phone, the most complete and reliable also accurate information about health, medicine, drugs etc, you could ever find online is here!",
        "It's great for primary self assessment and insyructions about common medical cases where knowledge and self awareness is important to take healthy steps but not for medication or therapy",
        "I like this app especially for possible interactions,which is very important for me but I had problems making an account",
        "Wonderful app to have. Love the notifications that are truly handy, instead of annoying.",
        "DOB calendar starts at 2001 and you have to scroll back a month at a time to get to your year which is ridiculous.",
        "Too many ads",
        "Complete trash. I type in painful numb swollen feet the only suggestions you offered was swollen testicles what the heck",
        "Probably the least helpful app I've ever used",
        "It should have a better symptoms checker.",
        "Always get the straight scoop",
        "Hard to put in my health symptoms. Touchy with even short word descriptions. Like trying to crack a code that you know nothing about.",
        "Permanent Email Spam. Literally sent hundreds of messages telling them to quit sending email. Regardless of the number of times you unsubscribe, or tell them to stop, these clowns continue to send it loads of messages. A situation I find completely unacceptable. So for me, it is pure trash.",
        "Useless app! What use is it when it doesnt specify all the diseases known to man. Found it useless when i searched for a common illness without any single result of my search. Moreover, you must choose the required number of illness before you complete your medical check. Nonsense! What use is it? Make a better service instead!",
        "One of the better aps out there. It is quick and easy to use. Wish there was an actual Doctor to talk to that accepts every form of medical. insurances. ***** (5) stars. A must have apt that is within reach for those all important emergencies, that always seem to pop up out of nowhere.",
        "Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!",
        "Tried to use the symptom checker but I couldn't even enter knee pain as an option. All of the preselected options were covid-19 symptoms! If this is all that is offered, the symptom checker can be trashed.",
        "reliable and fantastic",
        "The old online symptom checker would let you select an area on the body where you had pain. If only the app did, too. This app makes you type in what specific organ/part is causing pain. Well... I don't know specifically where it's coming from. The list they had to choose from didn't seem to apply, anyway. The old online format would then ask additional questions to narrow results down. This app only asked me one question that didn't really get me anywhere.",
        "Great app for getting an idea about medical conditions you may be experiencing. What happened to the visual selection? The one with the picture of the human? I'd much rather select a body part than type and scroll through a list of words. Might work for some people, but I prefer the visual aspect of that selection method. Please bring it back... Just as an additional option. Why take it out?",
        "Notifications have become political. Delete",
        "I only need reminders for meds and supplements. This app only allows you to select pre-set brand name pharmaceuticals. Cannot add your own custom items (such as Cucurmin or Alpha-Lipoic Acid). Also, reminder notifications are not aggressive enough. People with cognitive issues such as Alzheimer's or ADHD will most likely fail to take their meds. The app needs to repeat popup reminders until the user acknowledges taking their scheduled dosage."
