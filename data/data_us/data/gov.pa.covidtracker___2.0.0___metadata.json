    "description": "The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  \r\n\r\nThe use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children\r\nunder the age of 13.,\r\n\r\nHow the COVID Alert PA App works\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person\u2019s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.\r\n\r\nIf an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. \r\n\r\nUsers who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an \u201cExposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.\r\n\r\nIn the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.",

        "Now that there's a vaccine why don't you show where there's a vaccine. It's great that you have this app available and I've been using it for 10 months but can we pivot to showing where vaccines are or trying to help out with where that is? It's great finding out about all the problems with COVID but now that there's actually a solution available it'd be good to know where to find them instead of going to 50 different websites",
        "Exposure alert does not work, or I'll get a call next month that I've been exposed to COVID 6 weeks after it matters. A co-worker, that has the app with the alert ON, tested positive weeks ago. I work side by side with him everyday and found out a week after he was out why he was out. Not through the app though.",
        "The app itself is decent however it will only work when the County department of health is willing to work with it. I recently got diagnosed with covid and has been almost a week for a call with the validation code for the app.",
        "Since the last update they took off the daily death count. They only tell you the total death count up to the current date. Because of this the app doesn't exactly tell you the whole situation currently. In begining I actually liked the way app, but since of the many changes that isn't the case anymore. I feel as if they are trying to hide the real truth to the situation & that isn't a good thing at all.",
        "Save your time & storage space, it doesn't work. I received a call today as a follow-up to my quarantine. \"What quarantine?\" I ask. It appears that I was exposed to COVID-19 on Jan 7. I should have been notified to quarantine. Only, the entire system failed. 1. Employer never notified me of an exposure. 2. PA Department of Health never notified me of an exposure until 3 days AFTER quarantine ended. 3. App with exposure alert on did nothing! Waste of time. #NoConfidence #SystemIsBroken",
        "Everyone should use this app. It's easy to use to check in your health symptoms. I have experienced no battery drain on my phone. The battery use is less then 1 minute today and only 0.1% of my total battery use since last charge. So far no exposure notifications and I hope it stays that way.",
        "Great & Easy to use although I have only ever selected \"I'm good no issues\". Participate in surveys about how to improve app also.",
        "Not real sure it actually works. I've been out shopping for Necessities and it's never went off yet & info stats are available before noon news.",
        "It would be nice if there was a spot on the daily check in section of the app that had a CURRENT LOST OF SYMPTOMS. Just asking if you're okay or not doesn't help people to realize if they may have symptoms or not.",
        "Was OK. Now it has Vaccine info and wants my birthday. In order to put it in the way you have it set up, I would have to go back on your calendar 67 years, one month at a time (about 800 taps to reach Nov 1953). Please fix this with drop downs vs calendar selection. Otherwise, it's useless.",
        "Since I never received a call from the department of health when I tested positive to contact trace and give me the code to input in the app, this is a useless battery drainer.",
        "I suggest adding PA stats about vaccinations....as well as info on or even ability to make a vaccine appointment...and current phase status",
        "this isn't a reflective rating on this app; however, maybe this is proof on how well my VPN is working.. because i don't live in PA. does it even matter that i don't live in PA, if i was wanting to use the app? this raises another concern of mine. my VPN is on all the time, so how could this app, if i did set it up, know where I've been? does it all permission to bypass VPN settings? if not, how would it accurately know where I've been? or have i been mislead on what a VPN does?",
        "App asks me daily how I feel, thought this app would warn me if someone close has covid19, but after thinking that's a privacy issue.",
        "I like this App and think it's an excellent idea. My issue is that it requires bluetooth to run constantly and that really takes a toll on device battery life. If your phone dies or power is very low, you can't use the app. Try to make this more device resource friendly. I can imagine some devices losing power rather quickly as a result of keeping bluetooth on for long periods of time, and most people will use this when they are on the go and charging is limited. *Show check count - main page",
        "This app does not allow me to enable the alert feature. Bummer",
        "This app is a must have I don't leave my house without it running . The state of Pennsylvania had done a great job creating this app",
        "The only advantage to this app is immediate information. However, I am not convinced that is accurate. I realize that this app relies on participants checking in..... but it seems extremely suspect... With the extremely rising cases in this county and with myself coming in to contact with 10 times the population of this county and I haven't been close to even one person with symptoms???? Very strange.using this app I need to keep my phone on charge because my phone only last 3 hours on standby.",
        "Simple and unobtrusive, though I worry about how effective it can really be, since it would only work best if everyone installs it, *and* if everyone honestly reports their conditions. Still, it's a good effort, and a great app! Just limited by having to try to trust others to do the right thing.",
        "This app has helped me by notifying me if a store/shop/place is safe to enter.",
        "Error code 104. I have tried multiple times to install and Uninstaller the app but each time I click continue on the 2nd screen for sharing data analytics, I keep getting \"sorry that didn't work properly. Error code 104. Please try again\"",
        "Also IT technician: pixel 3a phone: this app does absolutely everything correctly. 1% battery after 2 hours so far. No popups, no slowing down my phone. It doesn't use GPS or my contacts list. It doesn't even ask for my name. The app doesn't need any of those to work. It just needs Bluetooth. Please encourage everyone to get this. We are in this together. Let's get out together.",
        "It does not appear to follow me via GPS, i live in lancaster but work all over the Philadelphia area and the app seems to only use the default county selection (unless i missed something). Makes it pretty useless for anynone that travels in PA.",
        "I like the information but the numbers don't match up to what the state reports on the website or what the news reports. The app is saying that there were over 7,200 new cases yesterday but a news website is reporting over 8,700.",
        "I am grateful to have them available to get the latest information on this awful virus!! I THINK the news they have been giving has so far been on target, based on what I see on the news. BUT, I don't think it's a great idea to read more than ~ for me, a few times a week. I can't speak for anyone else.",
        "Easy to install and use. Also includes a symptom tracker and gives weekly notifications reminding you that exposure notifications are active or when you turn off Bluetooth. I would like to see a feature where you can see how many \"contacts\" you've had. How many random IDs has the device collected? This would tell me how many people around me are using the app & how likely it is that the app would sense a \"contact\" with an infected person.",
        "This app doesn't require any permissions, including contacts and gps. Go to settings>apps>Covid alert PA, and you'll see. You don't need your bluetooth on if you're not out, so it doesn't need to be running. But mine's on all the time for my fitbit, anyway w/no issue.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Very clean aesthetic. Includes covid info, like stats. Wish there was a way to manually add locations you've visited and when. And the ability to interact more with the data. Solid effort, but needs more function.",
        "Easy to use. I like the county breakdowns. It should have a back button on the symptom checklist, though. The one day I missed checking a symptom on the first list page and couldn't go back from the second page to check it. I wish everyone was using this.",
        "Despite the description saying that this app uses Bluetooth to determine if you have been near someone with Covid/Covid symptoms, it is telling me I must have location services (GPS) turned on to work (to get Exposure Notifications). Between privacy and battery life concerns, this is a no-go for me. Publisher - please explain why location services (GPS) is required. Update: In reply to CoP, the app does say when trying to enable Exposure Notifications: \"(!) Location needs to be on; Feature is inactive until setting is on\". So I'm calling BS. Please fix.",
        "Very clever idea. Part of me wants it to alert me so I know it works but then I don't want to know I was that close to a positive person. There is very minimal battery draw even with location on. Since I have hands free phone in my car, the bluetooth is always on anyway. I have a samsung A10e. Nice job!!",
        "Bug: Cannot update/add symptoms after selecting \"no symptoms\" for the day. I like to check in in the mornings, but one day I checked in with \"no symptoms\" and later in the day felt unwell; I wanted to report my symptoms but apparently could not since I had already checked in with no symptoms. Seems like a glaring oversight. Otherwise, it's a good looking app with a solid premise.",
        "This DOES *NOT* use friends lists, contact lists, GPS, physical tracking, or ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. What this DOES use is near-range Bluetooth beacon scanning, so if someone else has the app and you pass them, their UNIDENTIFIABLE \"id\" gets tagged by you, and if their medical professional/PCP/etc positively tests them for COVID-19, it will alert those whose tokens were saved. It's effectively the 3DS's Street Pass lol. AGAIN IT DOES NOT USE OR REQUIRE CONTACTS OR PRIVATE INFORMATION. Help be safe, help others be safe.",
        "Ok folks, does the app ask for gps permission? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your contacts? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your storage? Nope. The claims by so called IT professionals who don't have the least understanding on how the Android OS allows aps to work on your device and are claiming it invades your privacy are bogus. Battery drain, that could be an issue, sure. Chances are if that is your case, you need to backup your device and do a factory reset then restore.",
        "This is a very useful app, easy read & helps inform everybody aware of anything old & new about COVID, ESP. since it is such a very deadly disease striking everybody in it's parh in many horrible ways & symptoms, & sadly death. God Bless\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",
        "The app says that exposure alerts are disabled and that I need to check my devices settings. When going to check the device's settings it tells me that the correct settings are enabled. It also gives me a random notification every once in awhile that just basically tells me that the app is installed. Seems pretty useless. I may be missing something, but I'm fairly sure I'm not.",
        "Requires location permission for no reason I can discern since this supposedly relies purely upon bluetooth. Maybe this app doesn't use it, but as a convenient (for Google & other advertisers) side effect it gives EVERY OTHER APP with said permission access to my location at ALL times (never mind the additional battery drain they'll cause). Other apps can use BT without location being on. Google's being slimy in order to get full-time location tracking through other apps. KMA, Google.",
        "Excellent app! But there can be a few improvements on the data presentation. The graph cannot be filtered right now. And without a more recent trend, it becomes useless for us to make an informed decision about the risk factor. Also, if the graph can be filtered by county level. And also add the percentage of positive tests being reported, it would be amazing!",
        "So introverted I was never around anyone long enough to set it off, but I was around people who contracted covid",
        "There's a bunch of armchair developers in these reviews. Anyone with any common knowledge can go into the app's info to see that it clearly says \"No permissions requested\". The only issue with is that it may not protect you because not enough people are running the exposure system. As poorly developed as it is, the app does it's job and has an easy UI. None of you have the knowledge nor the room to speak about how the app is developed and it's privacy - the blind is misinforming the blind.",
        "I figured out that every time I had attempted to install the app I was at work and the wifi was blocking the startup page. Turned off wifi and found a cell signal and it works just fine. I have a pixel 2xl with android 11. The app would not get past the start screen that asks if I'm ok sharing usage data."
