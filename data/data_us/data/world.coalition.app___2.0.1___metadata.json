        "It's a shame more people aren't downloading this app! It's also a problem when I search Google play store for COVID-19 apps and they only show 2 apps that aren't even for my area. I appreciate you and your team for helping with the issue \ud83d\ude4f",
        "Good concept and technology behind. Only a minor downside with some phone models draining the battwry but I see they are working to fix the issues.",
        "The app we all need for reliable contact-tracing with security and privacy in mind.",
        "Privacy and security oriented tracker especially useful during pandemics.",
        "I like the level of privacy assured and I recommended it on NextDoor. But I have a question. As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Micha Benoliel - Do you go stalking everyone who leaves a negative review about your products? I know you visited my linkedin, so I guess you visited all my other social profiles. Privacy isn't much of a concern to you or your company. I definitly came to the right conclusion about this app. I saw your previous reply before you deleted it. I'm just a user. Your behaviour is disgusting. I'm reporting you to Google."
