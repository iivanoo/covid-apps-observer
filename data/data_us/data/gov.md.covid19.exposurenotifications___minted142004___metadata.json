    "description": "MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nHow MD COVID Alert works:\r\nWhen devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.\r\n\r\nApple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:\r\nMaryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.\r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.\r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!",

        "Worthless. Even after someone in my household tested positive and the MD Health person doing contact tracing told me the app would notify me (due to their manual entry) this app still (13 days later) states that I've had no exposures. Not sure what the app is doing but it's certainly not notifying anyone of COVID exposures.",
        "The app literally doesn't work. There's not much else to say. When you open the app, and press \"Turn on exposure notifications\", all you get is an error saying \"Something went wrong. Try again\". I've had it installed for several weeks. It happened when I first downloaded it, and still continues. I'm going to uninstall it. It's pointless. EDIT: So, I decided to try this app again to see if it had been fixed. I guess I'll never know, because when I try to download, I just get an error message. ??",
        "Useless! As other reviewers stated, to enter positive results you need a code. My husband tested positive on 1-02-20, and the healthcare providers never reported his positive results to anyone. As a matter of fact, he has several coworkers that also tested positive and I don't think their positive results were reported either. No wonder covid keeps spreading in Maryland! Typical Maryland department of health. (Can't say that I am surprised!)",
        "Works well I guess. My biggest gripe is no feedback on the number of contacts made. It would be good to know how many people I have passed by that use or do not use the app in a given day. Why trust the app if I have no idea if it is registering or missing the people I pass by? There aren't even numbers on how effective this app is for me or everyone in general.",
        "It's certainly valuable to have a way of being notified if I was close to someone for 15 minutes who didn't know my name and who came down with COVID-19. The reason I didn't give the app 5 stars is that it doesn't allow me to check in daily and report suspicious symptoms. The only thing I can report is a test result. The other thing I don't like is that there are separate apps for neighboring states. That means that I have to have multiple contact tracing apps on my phone.",
        "There is absolutely no way to turn on exposure notifications. I've tried everything. Keep getting an error message when trying to do it from within the app, and the option is greyed-out when trying from within the phone settings, where it instead gives me a message telling me to install a participating app first. The phone does not seem to recognize this app as a participating app. Samsung Galaxy S20+, fully up-to-date Android OS, but cannot turn this on via app OR phone settings. Please fix.",
        "Very basic and not helpful, not as good as the PA state app. MD needs to up their game and show they're serious about getting us to use the app. The app directs us to the MD Dept of Health app which is not very user friendly on mobile devices. In comparison the PA app contains statistics by county, helps you determine if you need a test based on your symptoms, and how to report positive results. MD needs to include the same options.",
        "I have android 5 samsung note phone and I could install it. Read the info about the app which explains how it works (without IDg person or phone) and that made it clear that location setting doesnt have to be on. Bluetooth was activated by app; assume i need to have it active when outside the house. Haven't been anywhere yet, so can't really evaluate app properly. But happy to have this app and plenty of free and nearby testing where I live. We can use all the help we can get!",
        "Seems simple enough, not sure what the review claiming they couldn't enable notifications was talking about. Installer had message about permissions when it was starting, and \"Settings\" button was right inside the app. AND in the \"Apps\" management entry under \"System Settings\", the normal toggle switch allowing notifications was there. I admit there is no way to tell if it's working until you actually get \"pinged\". Users might need to make sure Battery Optimization doesn't put it to sleep.",
        "Broken Process. Useless app. My husband tested positive. The process: your health care provider reports your positive result to the MD Depth of Health and THEY text you a code to enter into the app to report your status. It took 4 days to get that code. Even after entering it, I still haven't received an exposure notification and we're together constantly. Verified all settings are correct. It actually has to work & QUICKLY to benefit individual users & public health. Extremely disappointed.",
        "Had to find a link from an article because it never showed up in the play store. Otherwise, I assume it's built on the same framework/template as many other states' apps and it remains to be seen how effective it is.If it really requires you to volunteer a positive test result, I'm not sure how they can expect much participation (or prevent trolling).Considering how little messaging I've seen and how resistant people are to even the most basic prevention, it seems like it may be a token gesture.",
        "Glad Maryland finally got one of these. It's absurd we don't just have a national system, but this is the next best thing. If you're worried about privacy, look up the \"3blue1brown\" video on YouTube explaining the cryptography behind contact tracing apps like this, and see for yourself how it keeps you safe and anonymous. Let's stop the spread.",
        "Requires GPS to be on all the time. Another reviewer stated the phone's location doesnt need to be turned on, but as soon as I turn it off I get a notification stating \"Exposure Notifications Inactive To use this feature, turn on location\".",
        "Thank you for this app. My grandparents have covid-19. This is very serious. Bluetooth does take up a lot of battery so I basically just turn it on before I leave to go to the store or out and shut it off while I'm safe at home. Please wear your masks and continue to social distance.",
        "Installation hung, had to reinstall. though feedback is mentioned, no feedback method built into app. to save power would be nice to be able to turn off when at home location where no visitors or exposure is possible. just installed so may be more feedback later, but no method within app.",
        "I wish there was a way to enable exposure notifications from multiple jurisdictions. As someone that works in dc/md/va it would be nice to have all 3 apps on and able to notify you, but you can only have one app enabled at a time.",
        "Glad MD was able to get this going. A nationwide alert system would of course be preferable, but the US is obviously not ready for that. Trivial to setup, unobtrusive, and the privacy/security framework seems sound.",
        "This app doesn't work. I was tested positive last week but am not able to update my status. I am living with at least 3 other family members who also tested positive but the app says I am not exposed. Maybe its too early and lots of bugs.",
        "The app does not register as being associated with Exposure Notifications for the Samsung Galaxy S20+. I attempted to contact the developer through the Play store, but received the following: \"Message bounced due to organizational settings.\"",
        "Garbage. Doesn't work. Incredible that money was spent on a useless app. It gives hope for no reason. You can't report positives. So it doesn't work.",
        "This app is WORTHLESS, a family member of mine has COVID and it's impossible to use the app. The verification codes do not work and there is no way to problem solve.",
        "It was horrible trying to download and install this app at first. Something told me to try again at 5am. It was installed in a flash. If this is an indication that servers were busy, then I am extremely happy that Marylanders are using it.",
        "Answer other's review: cannot turn on this app. Samsung S20, All the Android phone is automatic turn on the COVID notification. Go to setting and go Google set. will see the COVID 19 Notification turn on. Finally the MD launch the COVID 19 app. Thanks.",
        "App not turn on. Sends an error message each time. I've installed an uninstalled three times with no success. Google Pixel 3 XL running newest version of Android. Please fix the bugs.",
        "I don't quite understand how this is keeping me safe. It's relying on the honesty of the population. Those that self report using this app most likely won't be spending much outside their home. They'll be using door dash or have a family member or friend pick up what they need. Those that are positive and out in the community regularly will less likely self report on this app, if they even have the app installed.",
        "Without good data, useless. It should allow you to report known exposure sites and events rather than just personal test results. Oddly, a search for 'Maryland' does not find this app.",
        "This app is great! Easy to figure out, and the interface is good too. Exposure notifications were easy to turn on also.",
        "App is dependent on assumptions. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID19/SARS2 testing done by PCR is questionable. It is traditionally a quantitative test NOT a qualitative one used for ID. Viral culture is the gold standard. App presumably works by your phone's bluetooth communication with COVID + patient's phone. This function may not work properly. I have my doubts. Anyway, most people survive. Infectious disease has been part of the human condition since the beginning of time.",
        "Tried to install on 2 different devices and app will only enable notifications on one of them. Update: 01/08/2021 Still unable to enable notifications on Xiaomi 10 Ultra",
        "Just Downloaded But Unable To Turn On Notifications. Now It's Just Useless. And No It's Not My Phone. Please Fix Bugs.",
        "I have an LG ThinQ Android and was also unable to turn on notification directly or in settings. Same experience as comment below. Also tried uninstalling and re-installing app.",
        "Great app. Does not kill battery or face location. Please don't listen to the dumb conspiracy people. Everyone in MD should have this on their phone so we can get a control over the now uncontrolled virus.",
        "I tested positive for covid and I can't get the alert to activate in the app. It asks for a one time verification code but there is no information on where I get this code. I am finding this app useless.",
        "Can't turn on exposure notifications. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It still doesn't work.",
        "I have covid and need some kind of verification number to report my result. I don't have such a number and there is a useless help button that does not lead to any further information about getting a number.",
        "Trying to report myself that I tested positive but it won't let me enter in my verification code. Oh well, good luck everyone who crossed path with me this week.",
        "Hopefully this app keeps me safe so far what I have read about it seems safe for my phone privacy I'm giving it five stars for now I wonder if it will protect me and notify me in a safe distance from a infected person before they get within 6 feet with me I don't want to be talking to that person we're walking by somebody or around anybody and they are infected what about the people who are infected and don't even know that they are so many questions not enough words hope everybody's safe.",
        "Great app and genius idea. Easy install and easy instructions. Could be a life saver!",
        "I have Covid and it won't let me mark I do. When I ask any testing facility or official they tell me it is all handled through CDC... I know it's all bull shirt now... greeeat. Just thought I'll be helpful and tell everybody to stay inside and stop the spread, don't rely on the governor's app, it doesn't work AT ALL. Ive been positive for 2 days. No changes can or were made on my app.",
        "It will not work for me. I receive a notification saying \" something went wrong, try again\""
