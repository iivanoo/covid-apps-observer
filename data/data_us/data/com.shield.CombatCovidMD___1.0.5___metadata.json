        "Telling you to be tested IMMEDIATELY will give people false assurance when they test negative & haven't had sufficient viral load for detection. It does maintain confidentiality appropriately.",
        "Application is fantastic. Love the privacy and feel safer!",
        "Working fine so far... Let's spread the word, the more people install it the better it will work!!!!",
        "It's not sending me the pin # to access the app. I put in the correct phone #.",
        "This is a very necessary health app.",
        "Sweet, this is pretty cool that it doesn\u2019t track me.  It just uses Bluetooth to connect with others.  I did some research and this is the way to go.  Hope I never get notified of anything but will be glad to know I may have been at risk  if I ever do.",
        "Not working right says am positive when I am not",
        "This is a well made app.  I\u2019m a very private person and value my privacy.  This app is made so that it is respected.  It doesn\u2019t record my location or my phone number or track my location.  Well done.",
        "The app is explained well in the download process.  It should let people know that they were ever close to someone that later reported they were positive.  and its private. Load it use it tell everyone to use the app",
        "It is awful. When I am reading the message with the code number, the page changes to another. It does not allow me to get in.",
        "No issues at this point and it wasn\u2019t hard to download.  Hope it works as described."
