Nowhere did I do so much as insinuate that the app was for medical diagnosis. I know exactly what the app is meant to do, & insulting my intelligence is not going to hide the fact that the app is useless & does not do the job. They still haven't fixed anything. Literally thousands of complaints similar to mine & they still don't get it. The entire point is that chronically ill people ALREADY HAVE BASELINE SYMPTOMS, and if those aren't entered into ANY tracing application, the RESULTS WILL BE WRONG. How are you allowed to work on this app or respond to questions without that basic understanding? This is very definition of ableist trash. I stand by my original review: Absolutely worthless garbage. They don't listen & things keep getting worse. Inexcusable incompetence. I dont want your lying responses, I want you to do your job or get out of the way so someone who can has the chance to fix your mess. This is ridiculous. *** Original review: How can you possibly do anything like this without first allowing for a person's baseline health? I've got chronic conditions that share C19 symptoms. This app now thinks I've got C19. This is thoughtless, ableist, privileged foolishness. Throwing the chronically ill under the bus, as always. Why do you refuse to learn? Uninstalled. I want to be part of the solution, but your ignorant gatekeeping shuts me out. Nice job.",
