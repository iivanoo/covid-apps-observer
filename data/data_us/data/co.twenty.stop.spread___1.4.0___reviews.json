I've been watching other countries develop tracing solutions and have been anxiously waiting a domestic solution... this is unquestionably the most comprehensive, well built, solution. It looks and feels great, you can check your symptoms, locate test centers, and be notified if you may have been exposed to someone who has tested positive. Please share!! Everyone needs to participate for this to have the optimal outcome. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2",
