        "I really like this app. Keeps me informed about meds I might switch to or others I might need to take with the ones I am on now. Always like reading the post too. FYI to anyone who is reading this and who made WebMD. I tried to open it and it kept rejecting me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and worked. So if having any problems try it. It's like the last update didn't fully install or install right. Hope that helps someone.",
        "This was updated. Since then, I can't save my medications on the check interactions. We use to be able to do that. Save our medications. That helped me a lot. It helped me remember what not to take together. I have about a dozen medications that I take. I was really liking this. The medication you added, was there until you would delete it. Now, that's not a option at all. What's the clear all needed for, if medications don't get saved. Now, I hate it.",
        "I am tired of trying to read an article of interest and having interruptions that change what am reading and I can't back to the original article. Either permit to read my article to it's end or I will remove this app.",
        "Very informative app that I use as a primary and secondary resource for medical applications. Used in support of medical disability issues.",
        "Good app but lately crashing alot on my galaxy since January update.",
        "Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.",
        "Can't even open the app anymore. It just says WebMD has stopped or keeps stopping",
        "I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.",
        "This App is NOT WORKING. Won't even open.",
        "I really love this app its help me out more way than I would have thought its awesome \ud83d\udc4c",
        "Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.",
        "This app sucks, its slooow, buttons work at random, when they decide to work at all, I couldn't even get far enough in the app to completely describe my ailments. I DON'T RECOMMEND!! I uninstalled immediately after this review.",
        "I have found that searching for certain terms, such as \"dementia\", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",
        "A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!",
        "Was a good app. Now won't even open.",
        "Wanted to learn about possible thyroid problem and got a lousy quiz instead. What a joke!",
        "The app just updated and the app will not open.",
        "This is such an app for info on medical anything. Including identifying pills that you find in your cabinet and can't remember or know what it is.",
        "Terrible service ..trouble diagnosing problem or illness",
        "Symptom checker? If you say your arse hurts it tells you heart attack!",
        "Started getting political propaganda from web md. Very disappointed. Removing App. They should stick to Science and Medicine.",
        "Tried to give me results before I even have a chance to explain the symptoms. Useless",
        "Symptom checker seldom works properly. You're better off going to Google.",
        "Great info when you need it !!",
        "Permanent Email Spam. Literally sent hundreds of messages telling them to quit sending email. Regardless of the number of times you unsubscribe, or tell them to stop, these clowns continue to send it loads of messages. A situation I find completely unacceptable. So for me, it is pure trash.",
        "Great for finding out what symptoms can be indicating or treatment at home to help with a illness, injury, or ailment.",
        "The old online symptom checker would let you select an area on the body where you had pain. If only the app did, too. This app makes you type in what specific organ/part is causing pain. Well... I don't know specifically where it's coming from. The list they had to choose from didn't seem to apply, anyway. The old online format would then ask additional questions to narrow results down. This app only asked me one question that didn't really get me anywhere.",
        "I only need reminders for meds and supplements. This app only allows you to select pre-set brand name pharmaceuticals. Cannot add your own custom items (such as Cucurmin or Alpha-Lipoic Acid). Also, reminder notifications are not aggressive enough. People with cognitive issues such as Alzheimer's or ADHD will most likely fail to take their meds. The app needs to repeat popup reminders until the user acknowledges taking their scheduled dosage.",
        "this app used to be great. It would give you an avatar to select the affected areas, and a very extensive list of symptoms. It would then have follow up questions about the symptoms you chose. Now you must enter it all manually, and there are no follow up questions. In my opinion, this used to the best symptom checker available, but now it's just garbage.",
        "Honestly, I miss the old symptom checker. It seemed to be more accurate. This new form says (Over Exaggeration) that I died 7 years ago. I know nothing beats a living breathing medical professional, but none happen to be open today (Sunday) with out going to ER. In my profession, Saturday and Sunday are just days when no one's around.",
        "I miss the old symptom checker interface. I mostly used this app to help figure out the vocabulary of the parts involved with my symptoms but now I don't have a place to start. I also do not like all the added features, I have separate apps for those and it's creating clutter on my device. I'd rather have an app that does one thing well than a bunch of things poorly.",
        "This is a very helpful app to have on hand. It's versatile to many ailments and conditions. Saves a trip to the Dr or at least gives you symptons you can arm yourself with before going. Especially where children are concerned. I use it for my grown daughters and their grown kids. A must have app.",
        "Great information so helpful\ud83d\ude4f in so many ways. There are so many topics are useful to read. Its informative & I find interest in learning something new. WebMD talks about health, preparing for procedures, biopsies, etc ,. Being aware\ud83d\udc40 gives me an extra advantage of what's happening today. I always say do your homework before having anything medically done. Because knowing early will make the difference in life or death. Highly recommend subscribing.\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb",
        "Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.",
        "Used to be a really great resource, in perfect working order. Theyve since updated the symptom checker, which is now extremely frustrating to use and is very disfunctional. Should have left it the way it was. No longer happy with how this app works.",
        "I love having this app at my disposal. I dont use it often, fortunately Im pretty educates in medicine, but its great to have an immediate answer, research, education, facts, articles, even someonw live to assiat you! Plus the notifications are great! They constantly keep you in the medical loop with the latest news, explorations, diagnostics, current events with certain crisis' or even tips on how to stay healthier. I wish they had this when I was a child but its here now!",
        "One of the better aps out there. It is quick and easy to use. Wish there was an actual Doctor to talk to that accepts every form of medical. insurances. ***** (5) stars. A must have apt that is within reach for those all important emergencies, that always seem to pop up out of nowhere.",
        "It has some bugs here & there*, but overall it's great! 4out of 5 *(I am connected to the intenet, so i know this is a bug)on the Symptom Checker it won't show some of the medications that you take when you search for them & on the 'Drugs and Medications' button, if you added a medication to the 'My Drugs' tab then go to that tab and click on one of the medications you added, it'll prompt you with a message that says that you aren't connected to the Internet. TL:DR - then go back & read it...",
        "Used to be a very friendly symptom checker but, I can't even specify where the pain is because the app doesn't have that symptom in their data base. For example, pain under left breast or even left side of the rib. It's that simple, but I made it too generalize to even get an idea what to tell your doctor.",
        "Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!"
