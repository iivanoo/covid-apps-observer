    "description": "HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.\r\n\r\nTwo ways to tap in:\r\n\r\nHealthTap Prime. For a $15 monthly membership fee, you get:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Urgent Care visits, just $30 each. Available 24/7. For time-sensitive issues like fever, stomach pain, or dizziness. Connects you with a doctor in one minute or less.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Primary Care visits, just $40 each. Choose your doctor, see the same doctor for subsequent visits, and book appointments online. For ongoing preventative medicine and managing chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension.\r\n\r\nFor use without insurance.\u00a0HealthTap Basic:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Urgent Care visits for $80 each or a copay. Copay amount depends on the insurance plan. Many plans cover 100%.\r\nPrimary Care is currently not available through HealthTap Basic.\r\nHealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you\u2019re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Just like with in-person doctors, getting a prescription depends on many things. For example, your doctor might refill your antidepressant prescription in an Urgent Care visit, but they\u2019re unlikely to start you on a new drug. For managing ongoing conditions, it\u2019s best to start seeing a Primary Care doctor on HealthTap who can get to know you and your medical history.\r\nThere are some medications that telemedicine providers, including HealthTap doctors, rarely if ever prescribe or refill. These medications are nearly always prescribed in-person.\r\nBelow is a sample list of medications HealthTap doctors cannot prescribe. The list uses brand brand and generic names based on what\u2019s best known to consumers.\r\n\r\nOpioids and other controlled substances like:\r\nAdderall\r\nAtivan\r\nNorco\r\noxycodone\r\nValium\r\nXanax\r\n\r\nPsychiatric drugs like:\r\nAbilify\r\ngabapentin\r\nlithium\r\n\r\nLifestyle drugs like:\r\nChantix\r\nContrave\r\nQsymia\r\n\r\nIn addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:\r\n\r\n1.

        "so fast! I saw a doctor within 2 minutes that was polite professional and prescribed antibiotic which is exactly what I needed The whole thing was over and done with within 5 minutes from my downloading the app, amazing!",
        "Stay away! If you're needing a prescription filled and needing it filled correctly do not use this app or company. They will gladly take your money but not make any corrections once they have submitted a prescription. My pill quantity was supposed to be 180 as I take 6 pills a day. They gave me 30, gee thanks guys just enough to last me 5 days. Worthless!",
        "Very Professional...easy to navigate app...Md was Friendly, professional and took exceptional care of my medical situation. As a Registered Nurse for 25 plus years, I highly recommend this service and find it far superior to one other app I've tried.",
        "Awesome this is the best telemedicine service out there. Health tap doctors listen and actually care! I can't thank you health tap enough for actually bringing quality and affordable health Care to everyone. I honestly can't imagine not having health tap you are Lifesavers. I had I tell everyone and will continue to tell everyone to use health tap! Thank You",
        "Helpful and efficient. I may have waited 5-7 minutes but it honestly wasn't a big deal. The doctor was kind and he was also quick which for me when I am not feeling well is a even better score for me.",
        "Easy to use, free, user friendly. However, sometimes it freezes from start and I have to reinstall it repeatedly. Otherwise, it is a perfect app.",
        "I used this app twice and it was so quick and I seen a dr and he sent over prescription. This app is great I had no problem",
        "I've been using HT for months and now have my primary care physicians through them. Grest doctors, great service.",
        "Less than half an hour to download app speak with doctor and my prescription sent! Great service great doctor and I don't have to hassle with insurance company \ud83d\ude00",

        "i loved this apps,it is because how they help you here anytime i like how they serve you politely thank you",
        "Great, fast, and excellent service",
        "I've used the app twice. Once for myself and once for my teenaged son. Both times I was connected with a Dr. quickly - within 2 minutes. They listened to my symptoms, gave me some treatment advice and put in a Rx as needed to my local pharmacy. The whole process took maybe 10-15 minutes. The service is wonderful for someone like me - a working mom who often can't get a Drs appt for weeks and doesn't want to visit the ER for a non emergency, esp.during covid. And as a bonus the price is great.",
        "Much better than the competition. There is a lot offered in the app for free including the ability to get doctors answers to your personal medical questions. As well as an AI symptom checker. The $10 monthly fee for telemedicine visits is very reasonably priced, and you can cancel your subscription at anytime. Much better than going to an urgent care clinic during a pandemic. And perfect for requesting prescription refills from the comfort and safety of home.",
        "This is a wonderful virtual health program. Have tried others. It took one 6 hrs to get back to me. I like the monthly price. The physician, Dr. Patel, was very pleasant and professional. I like the fact that they are affiliated w a lab so test can be ordered if necessary. All in all it was a 5 star performance and experience. Kudos Health Tap.",
        "I have used this app twice now. Both times I had great knowledgeable doctors. 10 bucks a month is way cheaper than a trip to urgent care. Absolutely no wait time to connect to the doc even on a Sunday.",
        "So much faster, easier and cheaper than an ER visit. I've used the service twice so far, and the doctors are very good. I highly recommend this for anyone who does not have insurance or wants to avoid physical ER visits.",
        "Love it! Great pricing, and I had a Doctor in two minutes. Talked to the Doctor for about 15 minutes, and my prescription was ready by the time I got to the pharmacy. I get a lot of sinus infections, so this is perfect when I just need a prescription.",
        "Didn't have insurance and didn't have to put out of pocket during pandemic but money wasn't an issue I received a consult a prescription and so much kindness from Dr. Goldeburg then I ever have from any high prices DRs this app is no joke it really did save my life and prevented a stroke a heart attach without the fear anxiety or leaving where I feel safe. Try it is the act of to good but true",
        "I am happy with the process and the care I received. It is more affordable them my local clinics, I am paying out of pocket and $45 is more than reasonable.",
        "We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!",
        "Makes life sooo much easier for working people who are busy and without insurance. 10$ per month versus 170$ office visit and having to take time off work to go in. Love it!!!",
        "Health Tap has very professional doctors and make it easy for me to get my refills in between visits with my primary doctor! Also, more affordable than Lemonaid Health and K Health.",

        "This is the best app for health insights",
        "Excellent service and was completed in 15 minutes. Awesome app and great price too!!!",
        "This is such an easy quick experience. The Docs are so nice. It takes less than 5 minutes to get a refilll.",

        "best app ever spoke to a real doctor and getting treatment right away no lines no 40 min waiting rooms i love it",
        "Forces you to pay $45 set up fee or $65 per month for a Basic Membership. No longer affordable.",
        "Very convenient and helpful, the physicians are very quick and professional.",
        "Awesome so. And a great company. So easy and affordable. Nice work guys! \ud83e\udd18\ud83d\ude09",
