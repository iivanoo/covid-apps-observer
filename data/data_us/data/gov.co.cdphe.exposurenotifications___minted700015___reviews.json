I only have bluetooth on/exposure alerts enabled when I am at work around other people or out grocery shopping. When I am at home, alone, not doing anything or going out because there's a global pandemic, I wish this app would stop bugging me to turn on bluetooth. This was not previously an issue.

The health agency says if you have the virus between the ages of 0 to 70, you have a 99% survival rate. And if you\u2019re over 70, the survival rate is nearly 95%. While this CDC update is a relief for many, doctors are extremely worried, and an NCH Healthcare System doctor hopes you still take precautions.",
