        "Easy, easy, easy. The app installed in seconds. There is NO setup. It doesn't ask for any input at all. You don't need a username, password, or email address. Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.",
        "Great concept and actually really secure. Of course info security risk is the big red flag here, but after some serious digging it all checks out and they do keep your info safe.",
        "Idiotic making an app that's not backwardly compatible. My wife's iphone 6+ is up to date however the iphone version of the app won't install because it wants a newer update? Brilliant!",
        "Good idea ... But not yet ready for prime time, methinks. After I installed it, I could no longer use my Qardio Blood Pressure machine, which also communicates via Bluetooth. So I uninstalled this Nov. 30, 2020, and the Qardio app could connect again. Possibly a coincidence. I'll try this app again in a few weeks, after they've had a chance to iron out the wrinkles. Like I said ... a good idea ... assuming that the app attracts enough users to be useful. It'll need a lot.",
