        "An essential app for public health. I received an exposure alert in November and it was very helpful. The bluetooth proximity sensor is a clever way to contact trace while maintaining privacy for users. I wish I could dismiss the \"unable to check for exposures\" alert that appears hourly if your bluetooth is off. I only have bluetooth on/exposure alerts enabled when I am at work around other people or out grocery shopping. When I am at home, alone, not doing anything or going out because there's a global pandemic, I wish this app would stop bugging me to turn on bluetooth. This was not previously an issue. I can understand this from a public health perspective- you want to avoid people forgetting to turn the app off. But really, the hourly reminders are very annoying and actually unnecessary for a lot of users.",
        "Confusing app. When you go to notify the app you have covid it prompts you to enter a notification code. But the text message you receive doesn't contain a code, but a link you click on and follow prompts. The text I got after testing positive came 2 days later and was in a spam folder (I didn't know my phone filtered suspected spam). So I kept thinking I didn't have the verification code & contacted CDPHE several times to no avail. They should email the info too & have an FAQ on the app.",
        "To notify somebody if I have been exposed it asks for a verification code that was never given to me....so there's no way for me to notify. It defeats the purpose of having the app.",
        "Used to only notify you once about bluetooth, now does it all the time. That incentivizes me to uninstall since you cannot turn that notification off. Unfortunate.",
        "Thank you! There seem to be many people here complaining about the app who don't seem to get how it works. Ignore the reviews and use this app.",
        "Great information to have with so much going on its hard to keep up! This will make it a little bit easier!\ud83d\ude0a",
        "I have a question.. If your app uses Bluetooth to recognize other phones and that phone's user's status, what happens if I 'always' listen to music on Bluetooth headphones when out in downtown.. Is your app useless in this situation?",
        "I've had this app for several months but I've never had any reports of someone having Covid-19 which doesn't seem realistic.",
        "When you actually test positive you cant report it if you open the test results to see for yourself, as the code is one time only. so this app is useless.",
        "I tested positive for covid on Wed 2/3 and have been trying to report it to the app since to notify others and help contact trace. I haven't heard from the health dept or been able to get in touch w them in order to get my \"verification code\", which makes this app completely useless.",
        "Pretty useless since you can't let it know if you test positive without entering some sort of mysterious missing/failing verification code. Where is that supposed to come? Who knows because it is not mentioned in their guidance.",
        "Excellent design with regards to privacy and seems to work seamlessly in the background. If you read the reviews here very few negative reviews actually have anything to do with the app itself or it's capabilities. It's interesting how people are happy to give you identifiable information for no real reason, but get all concerned when it's something that actually benefits the public and doesn't give up identifiable information.",
        "This app doesn't work. I installed it when it first became available. It has never once in all that time reported an exposure regardless of how remote the exposure might be.",
        "I discovered the magic link was being texted to my home phone number! Mine is through Google Voice so I get an email copy. That email goes to a seldom used gmail address and the link won't open on anything but my mobile phone but clicking on the link bypasses the need for a code. Still one star. There's no documentation, it's pretty stupid to text a home phone especially when you have an email address and you shouldn't have to have an engineering degree to figure out reporting.",
        "This is an excellent tool. I think they could do a better job informing people on how they get the code to start the notification part though. For those interested, the health department can generate the code for you when you receive a call from a contact tracer. You cannot just trigger it based on a positive test result. Please answer the phone when they call after you have been tested or call them back.",
        "It seems rather useless. It's entirely dependent upon people reporting themselves. It's never reported a possible exposure until today. There is a zero chance that I don't encounter at least one covid positive person within a hundred feet of myself on a daily basis. The possible exposure was seven days prior to the notification. It said to quarantine immediately... Seven days ago. Yikes.",
        "This tool has a serious flaw. In order to notify others of a positive test result, you need a verification code. There is no explanation as to how to get this verification code. I have found media articles saying that a contact tracer may call me and provide this number. I'm on day five of potentially exposing others. I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Please communicate how we are supposed to verify positive test results.",
        "I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.",
        "It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.",
        "As others have pointed out, this program has a huge flaw. I tested positive for covid and I am not able to tell the program the app on the phone that I am positive because it needs some verification code that I don't have. Pretty much makes the app useless if nobody can report themselves as positive.",
        "This app is completely useless. I have been around three people who are verified positive for covid-19. Also my wife just had a positive covid-19 test and we have not been able to put that information on the application because there's nowhere to find a code to enter that is requesting. Might as well just remove this app completely.",
        "The previous complaints of not being able to fill out the app to notify people if you have been positive should be addressed in two ways: it should either be on the person who tested positive to figure out what the test number is from the department they used to get tested and it should be on the applications developers to notify people of this strategy. So both. But really it's just one thing.five stars because this is obviously helpful I think I mean some people might be embarrassed but whatev",
        "Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.",
        "The app seems great (simple, unobtrusive, easy to use, no major privacy issues) but what good is the app if people can't easily report their covid results? Why haven't they partnered with testing facilities to provide this code automatically upon getting a positive result? I've had this app for months and haven't gotten a single notification ever",
        "DOES NOT WORK! I work for a government entity and we recently had three positive cases on our floor alone in this building and we didn't get a single notification not when it started and not two weeks later. This app is a complete failure and a waste of your battery time and space!",
        "Most users won't have the patience or technical know-how to setup or use this app correctly which makes it nearly completely ineffective. The FAQ site did not have any info on where I could find a confirmation code to report a positive test; I found the answer in the freaking app reviews (CDPHE will eventually text you the code). While the idea is novel, the execution actively discourages adoption and use by anyone except tech-savy users.",
        "I find as others have said not getting notified. I would also like to see the areas in which covid is reported and numbers. This app seems pretty useless. I hope we as coloradoans aren't having to pay for this. It's clearly broken and doesn't work. Going to delete hate wasting space on my phone.",
        "App is fine and has not caused issues that I know of. It's completely useless. I work in retail and with the infection and positivity rates in the Denver Metro and suburbs you would think I'd have come in contact with someone who had tested positive over that month I've had the app.",
        "This is a great idea in theory. Unfortunately when you try to report a positive test result it asks for a verification code. To get a code you must look up your local public health agency, call them and ask to speak to a COVID-19 case investigator. Then give that person a bunch of information in order to get a code (none of which is explained on the app itself). With this much hassle required in order to simply report a result, this app is doomed to be an utter failure.",
        "Have the developers done away with the requirement for the verification code?I didnt see 1 review where a person stated the app successfully notified them.I did see plenty where ppl said it failed to.That's a good indication that something has got to be done.Perhaps notify ppl that there is a chance they came in contact with a user who reported positive results, however verification is still pending?When talking importance, 1st over all should be the need for users to report pos results IMMEDIAT",
        "Good call, Colorado but an issue with the app is that there is no verification code sent when trying to enter test results. I suggest you make this process a little more clear, and provide an FAQ if anyone else has run into this as well.",
        "I tested positive for covid and had no idea how to get the code to report my positive test. I seen its supposed to come from a contract tracer however they were so backed up they announced they're unable to contact everyone that is positive. So I never got contacted, and never got the verification code or link. This app was pointless. I don't trust the accuracy knowing how many people probably had the same experience as me.",
        "This app is too difficult to use for such a life threatening issue. It needs to be more intuitive before the public will actually begin using this app. It is should be easy to use by those who are not comfortable with technology, yet I am very comfortable with technology and the app took a while to figure out Please do something to make this better",
        "Time is of the essence! Trying to help a friend report a positive, but without the code it's pointless. Why create a roadblock like this that slows down awareness for everyone???",
        "Anonymous and opt-in only so your information and privacy is protected. Since it's release, the old manual verification system has been updated to be more automated. This app can save lives and works better when more users have it installed.",
        "People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.",
        "I tested positive for Covid on Oct. 26 and have never been able to report it because of the verification code issue. I even spoke with Tri-County Health and they couldn't help. Worthless app.",
        "I work with COVID patients. I haven't been alerted once in 1.5 weeks about a known positive, and I've been exposed each work day. I go to work and go home but many don't.. Definitely do not depend on this app. It's a wonderful idea in theory, though!",
        "Cannot turn on. Says: Something went wrong. Try again. 11.30 - still getting same error. 12.18 with new OS update still the same error. The Wyoming app works for me. No response from dev email.",
        "The app appears useless. I tested + . When I try to enter the result, it asks for one time verification code. After extensive searching, I was unable to learn how to get the verification code."
