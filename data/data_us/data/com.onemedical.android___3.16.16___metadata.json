        "The doctors are great. The treat me now feature is fantastic. However, customer service 100% unreachable and insurance admin / billing issues take months to resolve.",
        "It would be best if the app remembers the last office I went to and keeps that available on My 1med app . Also be on each page maybe. I only use the app on my android. When I see a dot by messages it should dissappear after I have looked at it. Under care plan, there needs to be an option for \"other\" to leave specific information. I would say....I tried to go to appointment but got lost, or it was too far, or they don't take my insurance. Love the Chat!!!!",
        "The provider was amazing: helpful, kind, knowledgeable, pleasant, answered all my questions, and easy and fun to talk with. Perfect!",
        "The video chat option is great for last minute visits for non-urgent medical issues. One Medical has been my provider for nearly a decade and I've been very happy with my medical needs, both preventative and reactive.",
        "I had a covid test a week ago and still no results. And I can't get anyone to answer what is going on. The lack of information is frustrating and makes me question my membership.",
        "I love One Medical! Telemedicine has been such a comfort for minor health issues like refills during the pandemic.",
        "The app does not even open and immediately crashes",
        "Extremely helpful service so far. Originally got one medical when I was having issues getting a covid test after exposure at work. Ended up using their extremely convenient drive through option 3 times over 6 months, all great experiences and easy to book through the app. Took my previous doctor 3 weeks to mail me a list of referrals, and now I can literally click a button and see people in network with available appointment times. So helpful! Definitely makes it easier to get treatment.",
        "Unable to make a Covid-19 vaccination appointment.",
        "They've been improving it as they go along and it shows. The video chat feature, with a knowledgable medical professional, 24/7, is invaluable. It's taken this \"old codger\" a while to get used to this approach, but I'm learning to like it.",
        "A ton of things fall through the cracks causing an immense amount of confusion with your healthcare that's the last thing you want to not have a quality application especially since this company leans heavily on the application alone outside of in person or Zoom meetings",
        "App is very straightforward to navigate. Response times from providers are usually very quick. Overall very happy with my experience",
        "I freaking LOVE One Medical!! They are the one bright shining spot in the dark hole that is the American healthcare system. I just got a flu shot plus a covid test, and the whole thing was so easy! The appointment system, app notifications, text reminders - such a breeze.",
        "It was reasonable until yesterday. Then, it forgot my password and later felt back to using a webpage. It completely changed the layout and I cannot enter information anymore the way I was used to.",
        "Almost perfect. It works very well. The best of my medical apps. But unread and unread messages look almost exactly the same. The title can be bold, not bold, or grey. Hard to differentiate, even with the screen magnified.",
        "One medical does a great job providing the features in app that make working with one medical so fantastic. You can schedule appointments, talk to a medical provider via video chat, and see test results. Honestly, it's such a game changer for primary care. Two thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
        "Have had a couple of calls using this up, and it's always been very clear, and keeps all content in one place! Great!",
        "Forward-thinking app that makes medical care more accessible - a great use of technology that I hope others follow suit on. Excellent UX design, very usable, great connections with doctors and physician assistants.",
        "Horrible, steer away at all costs",
        "Accessible, informative, helpful, pleasant, professional",
        "Registered and had a virtual visit. Great so far! Extremely easy to use.",
        "the app is equally as good as the one I used at Yale University when I worked there. efficient effective you can always count on it.",
        "It's the best thing to know that you can contact someone when you're really concerned about how you're feeling at any time of the day! Erin Barbacow is fantastic . She makes sure you have a way forward that you both feel comfortable with.",
        "Super useful to be able to chat with people whenever you have questions",
        "So far not good the app is slow and cumbersome....seems to do something weird to my camera",
        "Doesn't list the provider and clinic I want to go to...pretty frustrating",
        "Great app takes care of alot of issues with ease in one place",
        "Augments One Medical's already excellent service with video, text, etc, access to my medical team. Even more valuable in the midst of a pandemic.",
        "New users: Be very careful! One Medical did not indicate that my appointment would not be covered by my insurance nor was any amount ever presented to me beforehand. For a service that is digital and online, that is outright dishonesty, which is tantamount to scamming your customers. Shame on you, One Medical!",
        "Please update home screen icon to adaptive icons to fit in with android 11.",
        "Never felt so connected to my doctor before. Great app.",
        "Everyone needs this! The calling feature is amazing I recommend it to everyone!",
        "One Medical is the better then any other places I've been to, they are always in time, and always there for you 24/7",
        "It is awesome, you get the best care anytime and anywhere, Doctors are very pacient and always helpful",
        "Works pretty darn good to be honest, didn't know for a while but you can video chat with someone on demand, it took me about 10 minutes from tapping the thing to speaking with a clinician, neat! Also crucial was the fact that I told this guy that I had sent a message to the med team, and he was able to pull it up and see it. Well integrated and actually easy to use, which is insane for a medical app",
        "Very easy to use and convenient.",
        "Great unless you move outside an office area. Then extremely unhelpful. Their customer service staff also play games on phone calls. Will not sign up again for the same service I can get elsewhere without paying $200 extra.",
        "You have to have one medical service to use this app. Really great service! Totally worth every penny! Thanks One Medical!",
        "Super efficient and reliable",
        "This app is pretty much trash on Android. The ability to take a clear photo of your insurance card is not possible. I have a Samsung S10. Push notifications are inconsistent. Thank goodness I get email reminders. The questionnaire is not adaptive. Respond with \"None of the above\" and the following prompt asks you for more details \ud83d\ude44. This app has a ways to go before it's useful for more than simply booking an appointment."
