        "It doesn't use the same contact tracing technology as the rest of apps. Which largely renders it useless. While arguably using a more privacy oriented technology. In this rare instance it's pointless and a waste of taxpayer money.",
        "Absolutely useless. I found out that my neighbor has treated positive and the app did not notify me. Why isn't the official app for android and apple being used. What a joke",
        "The app is built on old technology. The app needs to be open in order to detect other phones. It does not run in the background, so if you forget to open it before you leave home, it is useless. Not good for such a critical app. Google and Apple built Covid apps to run in the background but this one does not. I emailed the company 2 weeks ago and no response.",
        "Requiring a permanent notification is a terrible way to setup this app. The majority of users aren't going to want a permanent notification running and taking up room and this isn't required by Android to keep an app running in background. If I disable permanent notification will app continue to run?",
        "Telling you to be tested IMMEDIATELY will give people false assurance when they test negative & haven't had sufficient viral load for detection. It does maintain confidentiality appropriately.",
        "Application is fantastic. Love the privacy and feel safer!",
        "Working fine so far... Let's spread the word, the more people install it the better it will work!!!!",
        "It's not sending me the pin # to access the app. I put in the correct phone #.",
        "Sweet, this is pretty cool that it doesn\u2019t track me.  It just uses Bluetooth to connect with others.  I did some research and this is the way to go.  Hope I never get notified of anything but will be glad to know I may have been at risk  if I ever do.",
        "This is a well made app.  I\u2019m a very private person and value my privacy.  This app is made so that it is respected.  It doesn\u2019t record my location or my phone number or track my location.  Well done.",
        "This is a very necessary health app.",
        "The app is explained well in the download process.  It should let people know that they were ever close to someone that later reported they were positive.  and its private. Load it use it tell everyone to use the app",
        "It is awful. When I am reading the message with the code number, the page changes to another. It does not allow me to get in.",
        "No issues at this point and it wasn\u2019t hard to download.  Hope it works as described.",
        "Not working right says am positive when I am not"
