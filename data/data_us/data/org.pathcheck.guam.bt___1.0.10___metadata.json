        "*Love* the design and ease of installation. Good job Guam and Path Check Foundation! Bias toward action. I like the transparency around privacy, but I wish there were external links to a credible audit of the open source code so that the in-app marketing assertions could be 3rd-party verified. I don't live in Guam and don't work as a Path Check developer, so I can't judge how the EN functionality works, but as an interested consumer, I say thumbs up.",
        "Great to have and keeps us alert for COVID virus",
        "Cool, whatever helps, even if the app isn't what everybody expected, atleast it's a value and can probably get you started on preperation.",
        "The app won't open",
        "It does what's it supposed to. I feel better knowing this app is available to help If the need arises.",
        "HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS INFECTED? I ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP MY BLUETOOTH ON. I WISH THIS APP WILL LET ME KNOW IF SOMEONE NEXT TOO ME IS INFECTED WITH COVID-19.",
        "I'm just curious as to why Bluetooth has to be turned on",
        "It doesn't open",
        "My president BT said her dad can choose who will die so I have to vote 5 stars for this. Otherwise it's a pretty good app",
        "Do people really think someone positive would report it in this app for nearby people to know",
        "Google",
        "The best!",
        "Not from Guam works fine",
        "Easy onboarding",
