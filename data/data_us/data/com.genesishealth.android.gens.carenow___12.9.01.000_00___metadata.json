        "Extremely helpful to avoid in-person visits during COVID spike era!",

        "This was an amazing experience. I was really scared to leave the house with all this covid-19 stuff going around and especially to the urgent care since I am comprised. So my call only took about 5 minutes and I had a diagnosis and meds sent to the pharmacy. I am so very thankful for this!",
        "Great app to use if you want to save a trip to an actual doctor's office or clinic. If your symptoms sound serious enough THEN they recommend coming in. :)",

        "Very professional doctor. Pleased with how she took the time to perform a thorough virtual exam and provided excellent education. A convenient and inexpensive alternative to urgent care for many acute symptoms.",
        "This is the best way to get quick help without getting exposed to other illnesses. Everyone was super nice and helpful.",
        "It's great just doesn't let you go your full length of time for your dr. Appt before it cuts you off",
        "Once setup is done, very easy to use",
