        "2nd time using the online doctor visit. Both good experiences. Better than going into a possible covid infested waiting room. I used my phone and had no issues with the connection at all. This will always be my 1st choice if it's something that can be diagnosed over video chat. I was only billed $59 so no complaints about that at all. Wait time was less than 10 minutes.",
        "With two kids, this is the best app on my tablet. I have used it while traveling, after hours, and holiday. My kids seem to suddenly need medical attention at the most inopportune times. This app has saved me 4 trips to ER/Urgent care in less than 2 years.",
        "Really horrible service 100% of time - multiple attempts. I wanted this service to be successful, its not. Disappointing.",
        "I was able to set up my account and talk to the doctor in less than 15 minutes (this includes the time that I spent on the phone with the doctor). I would highly recommend!!!",
        "This app is very easy to use. There were lots of provider options and the entire process took less time than checking in at urgent care.",
        "Don't understand why BCBSofM couldn't verify my insurance. I pay way to high a premium for that. That's very iritating. However, other than that this was a positive experience.",
        "Good visit with nurse had to do over phone due to video actually not working but will not do again.Have to see in person doctor Even though just a normal script refill something that is well documented and nothing major.",
        "Overall good experiences, perosnel were very educated. The video quality was a little spotty but did not dissrupt my visit.",
        "Doctor Good, App Mediocre. Doctor Boehr was quick to evaluate and get me the help I needed. The BCBSM online app, however, failed to connect to my BCBSM insurance information. It also failed five times to verify and accept any credit card information.",
        "Worked very well. Be sure to have any PCP information and any of your meical history, allergies & list of medications to speed things up.",
        "My Doctor was very helpful and understanding. This is a new way to have ailments addressed more immediately.",
        "I used it for online doctor consult. Took me 10 minutes and cost $10 !",
        "Overall great! Addressed my issues with care & understanding.",
        "Was fast and easy. Safe way to stay away from covid.",
        "Excellent experience, the doctor was very professional and friendly",
        "Very easy to use, right from home...thanks",
        "What a FANTASTIC experience! You can choose from several doctors, and you can see how they look and their experience. The only thing missing, obviously, is a physical exam, but how nice to be treated and not have to leave home!",
        "The experience was great. Quick and easy.",
        "Easy and convenient",
        "So this was incredibly easy to set up. Was able to create an account, list all my symptoms and see a doctor within about 45 minutes. That's just awesome. Thank you very much for making the entire process incredibly seamless.",
        "They charged me for the visit I had for my daughter, even though they told me there was nothing they could do about her uti and said to take her to urgent care. Um, hello, covid. Why tf do you think I did a virtual visit?!?!",
        "Visits and prescriptions in under 10 minutes for any basic illnesses. Fantastic every time I've used it!",
        "I really liked knowing that I did not have to go out to the doctors office. It would have been very difficult for me. The app worked perfectly.",
        "It went very well. Easy to use. My doctor was nice. Quicker than going to an urgent care location. I will definitely be using this in the future.",
        "Very Professional and helpful",
        "Great way to see a dr. With out haveing to leave home. Very convenient.",
        "Awesome and quick. Was able to do at work in a few minutes. No need to wait at urgent care later for ear ache",
        "Photos wouldn't upload but otherwise everything was great.",
        "Fast, easy, less expensive and safe.",
        "Psychiatrist can only \"do\" medication management. How can anyone \"do\" med management without your records or psychiatric work up. If you just want a bunch of Xanax, this is the place. If you need a help or are trying to determine what you should do for a loved one, this is not the place. Shame on you bcbs.",
        "Real convenient. Thanks!",
        "Fast an simple respectful",
        "Easy to use and very helpful!",
        "Doctors are nice and usually not a long wait.",
        "It has been a very positive experience using the app",
        "Excellent option to see a doctor virtually, especially when you don't feel well!",
        "Easy to use and fast",
        "So fast & easy to use!",
        "Convenient, worked great for me",
        "Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting. You'll have to re-log back in again although the info. you previously entered will still be there to copy over."
