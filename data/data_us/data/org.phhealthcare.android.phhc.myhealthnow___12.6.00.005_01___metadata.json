        "Great for fast covid screaming and test order",
        "Sound isn't very loud. If my house hadn't been totally quiet, I'd have never been able to hear my doctor. Trying to get this app downloaded and set up was a little aggravating but now that I got it done, this is a really neat app! So much better than having to run to the doctor! I can talk to him in the privacy of my own home. This also helps me to remember the things I want to discuss with him.",
        "I was able to see my dr, talk to her like I would of if I was in the office! This app is great! The only downfall is if you have good signal/internet. There were delays when we were speaking and when I was showing her the problem with my leg. Otherwise, I would DEFINITELY use it again!",
        "Easy to use fast and responsive much better than going in for little things unless you absolutely need to be seen right then and there it's a better alternative. Wait times are still slow but that's with anything nowhere near as long as a hospital would be on average",
        "Works pretty well. Could use a few fields for entering your vitals before the visit but other than that a great App. Video and audio was clear. App was easy to use.",
        "Very fast and reliable. Easier then having to drag my daughter out in the weather and during this pandemic. Highly recommend!",
        "Only used once but felt good about it. The Dr was very kind and listened to what I had to say. The app was fairly easy to use and I had no issues utilizing it.",
        "Kept us safe from Covid 19 exposure. We are \"at risk\" persons. Appreciate being able to communicate with our doctor safely.",
        "I could not find the lung center on Friday just Q-Care. The Lung Center called me on Friday stating that how they will do my appointment on 3/30/2020. I have an appointment with the Lung Center this morning 3/30/2020.",
        "Easy to follow thru the pages of the app., too get to the actual appointment page.",
        "Overall a great app, but there was a rather long delay.",
        "I was so nervous about getting this app and setting it up the doctor's office walked me through everything it was so easy I thank them all",
        "Easy peasy. Wait was a bit long but I would wait just as long if not longer at my pcp",
        "Everything worked smoothly. Very convenient.",
        "Excellent service,a little quiet between talking",
        "Clear view, great sound, no issues",
        "It saved time no waiting and was really quick.",
        "Makes life easier when you can have your appointments in the comfort of your home",
        "First time using the app and I had a doctors appointment to see my doctor. It was experience to go thru and I'll never forget it. We was both laughing and I told him i hope i see him soon face to face. Hopefully this COVID-19 goes away soon. God Bless Everyone.",
        "Sound was very choppy and missing pieces",
        "The doctor is very polite make sure the guy was very nervous at first but he's a play guy and it wasn't bad at all actually was nice I got to sit at home in my bed and do it have my appointment",
        "Easy and convenient to use.",
        "Was good but cut out quite a bit",
        "All things considered it was fast and easy.",
        "I met Bethany for the first time today & did my first ever video appointment... Both were wonderful... My internet connection not so great but she was very helpful & I can't wait to talk with her again!",
        "Excellent app. Works very well.",
        "Was easy and fast",
        "Very satisfying and convenient",
        "Worked like a charm which is awesome during covid-19.",
        "Very easy to use.",
        "Good but kept breaking up due to poor receorion",
        "It was helpful WHEN you could get it downloaded",
        "Great thing to have",
        "App fried the camera on my phone.",
        "It was good",
        "Excellent",
        "EXCELLENT!!!",
        "Very Professional",
        "Good experience.",
