Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service.\r\n\r\nUT Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you were closer than 6 feet from someone who has the virus for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or longer in a 24 hour period, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you\u2019ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you of a possible exposure.\r\n\r\nIf you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://coronavirus.utah.gov/exposure-notifications/",

        "I'm excited for an app to notify about exposure, if we had this 6-9 months ago we could have seriously flattened the curve and saved lots of lives. This app will need pretty good installation rate to be effective. It looks like 5k installations today so far.(I think this is the first day), hopefully the adoption continues. We needed this 6-9 months ago, before the vaccine was available to slow the spread. Well here's hoping lots of people install it!",
        "I appreciate that this app allows people to be notified anonymously that they've been exposed so maybe people will feel more comfortable communicating testing status vs trying to reach out to everyone they may have been in contact with. Hoping enough people download it to make a difference.",
        "Definitely late to the game, but I am happy to see Utah finally supporting the Exposure Notifications System.",
        "Let's hope enough people install this.",
        "About time Utah felt like making one.",
        "Yeah... I'm just not okay with this. Like I get they want to beat the virus, but letting everyone know you have it is a bit much. Not everyone needs to know.",
        "Easy install and ability to share the app with others. Would rate it higher but so far no vital information has been shared as the only way it works is if a majority of people install/use it. PSA to other users....Share the word post it on social media.",
        "Very intrusive. Runs during phone calls. It also drains my battery.",
        "Excellent to have someone tell you you're sunburned or not",
        "Easy install."
