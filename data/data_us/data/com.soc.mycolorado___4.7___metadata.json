        "My app was working just fine and I was using it constantly then about a month ago it stopped working. When I would log in it would go back and forth to the pingid and login screen. It will not properly work. I also sent an email about it and never received a response back. This app needs to work properly! Edit to add even after the new update it still doesn't work. Just does the same login then ping I'd then login again. Very disappointed as I would use this often.",
        "This app is currently unusable on Android 11. Clicking the login results in an immediate certificate error that boots the user from the login page. There is no way to access the app as an authenticated user. I have tried the following to fix the error with no success: 1) Clear app cache 2) Clear all app storage 3) Delete and reinstall app Please fix this. It is a great idea and I really want to use the app to purchase a fishing license. I will update this review when the issue is resolved!",
        "Not for use in any situation where speed or proof of insurance is necessary. Alot of layers of security just to open the app, then I'd get kicked completely out of the app when I tried to open the proof of insurance. Then of course all the security again. I ended up using the paper documents anyway. And didn't we fight a war or something to avoid apps like this anyway?",
        "Update as of June 2021: App is unusable, keeps telling me to update, brings me to the app store, then no update available. Shame because now I can't use the digital fishing license... Old 5 star review: This app is great, no idea what the others are saying. Easy to add vaccine card, insurance cards, fishing licenses. I can't wait until this gets more adoption across the state (and nation).",
        "Worked fine until the update. Tried to update and it would go right back to the start screen. Would not update or allow me to log in. Now I don't have digital drivers license or a hard copy because I lost it. This really sucks. Can't use it. Fix this app!!!!",
        "This app worked fine until april/may 2021. Now the app just crashes. The app is a good idea and nice especially if on a bike so you dont need to carry as much, problem is the app does not and will not stay open. It crashes constantly and some features will not open at all and when tried, it causes the app to crash as well. I wish the powers at be could get this app to actually work. Ride safe, Kg",
        "App not user friendly - doesn't accept correct password. Reset password link fails to generate verification email /code. Login brings up PingIdentification page with error code 400 badurl. That's on my Android. On my daughter's apple phone the app won't even load - just sits on login page constantly loading. Be nice if it would get better instead of worse over time. Did CO State Gov give up on this and forget to tell everyone?",
        "Was once brilliant. Now I can't sign in. I called and was on hold, person answered, then hung up. I called again, left my phone number for a customer service rep to call me back, got the call, answered, then they hung up. Just incompetent and unprofessional. Get it together.",
        "Nine out of 10 times I'm unable to log in. On the few times I've been able to get to the authentication page afterwards I get an error message. I thought this app would be a game changer having everything in one place but I can't even get it to open",
        "I created an account and the page was down. I thought it might just be doing maintenance so I waited 24 hours and tried again; it still doesn't work. I'm starting to wonder if that app is legit and who I sent a copy of my ID to",
        "Developers let their certificates expire. Impossible to log in. All I can do is report the error via email which I have done. Can't believe it hasn't been resolved already.",
        "This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with \"certificate errors\" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.",
        "Worked for 2 month, now it says there is an update in the app store but it will not do so... no matter how many force closes and resets.",
        "Worked great at first now it just gives me an error code and says it will be fixed soon. It has been a month now and still wont work",
        "Cool at first now it keeps saying there is an update even after downloading it it just keeps going back and forth from update screen to the app and occasionally it will lete click on the sighm in button but say all certificates need check or remewed",
        "It was working awhile ago but now I can't log in. I've tried verifying my user ID and reseting my password. It tells me a message will be emailed, multiple requests and no message sent.",
        "Left my wallet at home before a night of drinking. When all hope was lost, the bouncer at a bar downtown recommended that I download this app and get my ID virtual because it works scanning-wise. One family member at home and a quick set up later, and I was good to go starting my saga of belligerence. 10/10 wingman this app",
        "Worked for a while, but now it won't open my ID, registration, or insurance card. This app is useless if it's not reliable.",
        "This app continues to be rather useless. Login process repeatedly kicks you back to the login page after entering a two factor code.",
        "Just stopped working. I try to login and it says page ain't available. Please fix issue.",
        "I've used the app twice. Now it won't even open well it opens but when I hit log in nothing happens some warning sign pops up saying it's down. Lies lies lies lies good Ole Colorado",
        "Was a great app till they updated something and it's doesn't let you log in anymore , also doesn't send the recovery password to email?",
        "Won't accept my password to sign-in, and won't accept my existing password to let me change my password. So, it's completely useless. You wouldn't want to rely on this for ID.",
        "Great way to have a backup of your fishing license and ID in one spot. Bars are starting to accept it as valid ID!",
        "Went to the DMV literally TODAY, and it will not authenticate me. Says it can't match my photo. I look exactly like i did 3 hours ago, hairstyle, clothes and all. This is absurd.",
        "It's absolutely useless. The image recognition tool simply does not work. Surely there is a better way to verify identity.",
        "After some initial troubles the app is now stable and very efficient. More features are being added and it is a useful tool for residents.",
        "The scanning took forever to get right but once you get it working it's good.",
        "Won't even open!! ... tells me it has an update and sends me to the store....there's no update....typical bureaucratic incompetence...",
        "Created an account and can't log in plus no way to recover account. Trouble logging in button does nothing : (",
        "Tried to sign up when the servers were down. It works now and is great. Really glad Colorado developed this.",
        "Unable to log in now, says there is an update but when \u00cc try to update it says it's up to date.",
        "Can even get the app to scan my ID. So many other people are having the same issue. would not give any stars for the Shyte quality CO wants to make their ID's from.",
        "Can't create an account. The app will scan my ID and let me go all the way through the username and password creation and then when I click okay, it pops an error message saying null",
        "no longer works now that \"PingID\" was implemented - I've been \"authenticated\" more than 10 times in the last few mins and still can't access any of my digital documents. Keeps asking me to log in again (never actually logs me in after authentication - just takes me back to the home screen) I even tried resetting my password in case my account was locked. NOPE. same results -- if you want us to use this, MAKE IT RELIABLE!!!!!!!!!!",
        "Buggy for now but it's still new. Very useful when you've forgotten or lost your ID or wallet.",
        "I saw other comments about the digital ID not recognizing them the same day they went to the DMV. I gave it a try after I went in yesterday and got the same error message as everyone else. I gave it another try today and it worked! Looks like it takes a bit of time for their system to update, which is understandable. A government app that kinda works... what a nice surprise! 4 stars!",
        "Very easy to use and upload information. Wish all agencies along with TSA accepted the digital documents. Still solid after 6 months.",
        "App stop working a few month ago. when try to login it cant find my account and when try making a new account the app wont scan my ID",
        "App crash and doesn't work. I email about the issue and get no response back."
