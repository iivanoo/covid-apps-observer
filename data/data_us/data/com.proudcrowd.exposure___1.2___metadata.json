Care19 Alert uses Apple\u2019s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. \r\n\r\nCare19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.\r\n\r\nCare19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. \r\n \r\nThe downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.",

        "I see my review got deleted. Here is my thoughts. I have to turn off and on wifi with bluetooth all the time for a chance for this app to work and log. Please allow the app to control Bluetooth and notify when it isnt truly working and option to turn on and off bluetooth automatically for it to work. Simple programing and still not working right.",
        "App won't open past the second screen where you have to agree to the disclosure. When you click the \"I agree\" button, nothing happens. Fully updated Samsung Galaxy S9. App is worthless if it won't open.",
        "Not really sure how often it does a check but from what I see from the pictures it's suppose to check 2 hours or so and I will go hours between checks kind of disappointed in the app not going to know if I have been exposed if it don't check when it is suppose to",
        "I can't get passed the accept screen. When I push the button nothing happens . I am a college student and the only family member leaving my house so this is a very important part of staying safe. Any help? I'm using a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro and the most recent android patch.",
        "I had the app and was diagnosed with Covid. I sent my caseworker a screenshot of the app so I could get my 'notify others' button turned on. I don't know if she could do that or not, but she didn't address it. I had no idea how to activate the button to do the only thing this app is supposed to do.",
        "This app will only be effective and useful if a large percentage of the population install and use it. It looks like only 10k people have downloaded the app. With a combined total of 1.3M people between ND and WY, that is less than %1, the install base is likely even less since people have probably uninstalled it.",
        "It worked when I first downloaded it now it stopped working and can't get it to work at all. I tried everything. How can I get it to work please help",
        "Doesn't work anymore Edit: It is working again",
        "Disappointed...was exposed to person on 22nd...who began symptoms on 24th, tested positive on 25th. I was notified by state as a close contact (within 48 hours of symptoms) and to quarantine 14 days. We both have the apps on phones and Bluetooth turned on. The positive person 'notify button' was not activated until 30th. I received zero notification from the app. Needs some work from what I experienced.",
        "Doesn't do what it should. Just takes up space on your phone or tablet",
        "I think this is a great way of keeping track of where you have been and who you could possibly come into contact with, without any effort.",
        "Contacted the developers asking why Wyoming residents need to contact the Wisconsin department of health as stated on the \"notify\" screen. Received a canned response that had nothing to do with my question.",
        "I dont live in the states that are provided, please add more states to this, and I will be an ambassador for the app.",
        "I love the concept of this app, but major issues needing addressed. Functionality of my device (android) slowed to near unusable, it was very \"buggy\" ie: Device would freeze up, apps closed without warning or would not open at all! Device shut down or restarted spontaneously, battery drained incredibly fast, plus any available memory was used sometimes within minutes so that I had to go through each installed & factory app to dump cache 2-3 times DAILY. If fixed I'd love to try using it again.",
        "This is an anonymous way of doing contact tracing. Great Job!",
        "App has stopped checking for recent exposures .",
        "With ND's depressing lack of proper response to COVID-19, I was afraid this might not exist for the area. Thank you.",
        "I love the app because I love it",
        "Shouldn't have any sort of tracker koek this. If there isn't o e for the flu or any other virus we shouldn't have it for this.",
        "Should not have a location requirement! More coerced privacy invasion from Google APIs.",
        "We all need to take positive action to control the spread of the virus. It is our responsibility to keep us all safe.",
        "Add support for SD, please!",
        "Absolutely love it",
        "The idea is garbage, but the app is absolutely garbage how it works. Ot is a virus its self.",
        "Not any relevant information for right now!! 11-15-20",
        "This app was no good it gave me covid",
        "Seems like a good app but here's a question, will this app be effective even though I am in Colorado? Will it be effective in another state",
        "Communism is the very definition of failure.",
        "Don't put stuff on my phone if I want it I would get it",
        "I didnt open it at all",
        "Great!-!!\ud83e\udd14",
        "Works great",
        "It thinks I'm in North decode and Wyoming but I live in utah.",
