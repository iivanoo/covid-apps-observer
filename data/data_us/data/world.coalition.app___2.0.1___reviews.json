As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron \ud83d\udc4d",
