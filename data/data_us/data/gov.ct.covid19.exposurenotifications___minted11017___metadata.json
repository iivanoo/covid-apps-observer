    "description": "COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut, supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health.\r\n\r\nUsing COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain the virus.\r\n\r\nOnce you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users\u2019 privacy, these keys are only kept on the user\u2019s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.\r\n\r\nIf a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.\r\n\r\nA positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.\r\n\r\nCDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CTDPH to know where or who you are for COVID Alert CT to work.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CDPH.",

        "Happy with this app so far. It was easy to set up. I like that it focuses on privacy (no permissions required, data anonimized, etc) while helping me do my part to keep us all safe.",
        "Cannot turn on Exposure Notifications. Keep getting \"Something went wrong. Try again.\" Followed settings instructions, uninstalled/reinstalled app. Still getting \"something went wrong\" message.",
        "So far so good. I like that you are not required to put your personal information in to use the app. Im happy they came up with something to notify you if someone nearby has the coronavirus.",
        "Great app. I was reading Wormwood a book about apocalypse in Connecticut and the app reminded me of the one the main character has in that book. Its also nice to know when its better to just stay home.",
        "You have to keep your location and Bluetooth on for it to work. That eats up battery. Otherwise it's functional. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
        "The app requires ZERO permissions on your phone. the app doesn't know who you are, and doesn't know where you are. They did a great job at anonymizing your data. again, GPS IS NOT REQUIRED OR ASKED FOR. it's either we install this app or shutdown the country.",
        "Installed without any issues. I was worried that it might drain the battery but so far, it uses so little it registers as 0% per hour.",
        "I had no problems downloading this app on my Android phone. The more people who download this app will make this more effective. Will ask friends and family to download as well.",
        "Seems like they did a good job to make this as anonymous as possible. no permissions are required by the app, which is really nice.",
        "Can't turn on the exposure notice. Keeps saying something went wrong even Uninstaller it and that didn't work.",
        "This app is worthless! Unless you input positive it will not alert you. There is no way I drive through Waterbury and not 1 alert!!!! What a scam.",
        "Install on my Pixel 4A was smooth and you can tell it's well designed and not a hacked together iOS port.",
        "Easy to install, but I can't put a shortcut on my home screen. I have to search for it every time I want to open it. Everyone be safe.",
        "I had no trouble downloading the app on my android, and it automatically activated notifications.",
        "Error free install on Samsung galaxy with current OS. Looking forward to everyone doing their part.",
        "Downloaded and went to turn on notifications and it immediately says something went wrong try again",
        "Works fine. Hope I never get a ping about being near someone thats infected!",
        "Finally! Took the state forever to get a tracing app out, was looking for something like this months ago.",
        "Clean interface, and it seems to work well so far. Stop the spread!",
        "It ONLY tells if the Bluetooth is ON ? Right... if the person tested positive and the Bluetooth is off dosen't work?",
        "Cant turn on exposure notification keep getting something went wrong try again",
        "Overreaching, evil tracking, just so govt can get you used to \"social tracking\" & who you intact with",
        "Easy to download and activate on my Samsung Galaxy device.",
        "Quick and easy to install.",
        "I researched how this app works and I'm very comfortable with the way it protects privacy. I am curious though, if I'm around someone from another state that has their state's app and they get covid, will I get notified?",
        "Just DL'd it so i don't know how well it works but WHAT AN AMAZING idea and UTILIZATION of technology! And it's ANONYMOUS!",
        "This is by all senses of the word a life saver. Thanks guys",
        "This will save lives, Thank you",
        "So far so good, I just hope enough people are downloading this app!",
        "exposure notifications won't enable",
        "As long as it helps people and can't identify me I'm cool with it. I",
        "I can't turn on my notifications",
        "Very helpful app",
        "I cannot turn on exposure notifications -- I keep getting an error message.",
        "Do your part, wear your mask, keep your distance and install the app",
        "Its help know whats going on ct...",
        "Useless. Reports \"something went wrong, try again\" endlessly. Thanks for nothing.",
        "Dont know if realy work",
        "This app dont work at all..i downloud but no said anything at all.",
