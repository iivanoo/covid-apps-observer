        "Great app lot easier than having to go and see the doctor for a simple refill",
        "Messages stopped working on app and online! I keep getting an error when all fields filled in.",
        "This was awesome,,,the practitioner was fast and very nice.",
        "This app is garbage and so is the desktop version. I've been waiting an hour and a half and it just keeps glitching and kicking me out of my spot in line. It gave the option to connect with the provider by phone call instead, so I hit that option and still nothing. No call. No video appointment. Nothing. Guess I'll get dressed and have my hubby take me to the instacare instead. I better not get billed for this.",
        "Update: 2 hours of down time now. I'm trying to see a decent doctor for a misdiagnosis from Dr. Tyler D'Hulst about my hand. He said tendonitis but it's turned into a bulge in my tendon and it feels like it split and latched onto an adjacent tendon in my hand. My middle and ring finger on my dominant hand will not move independently anymore 24/7/365 is a lie I've been trying to get on for an hour and it just says they're \"upgrading my experience\". I don't see downtime as an upgraded experience!",
        "Risky, the PA I got said that it didnt look like an allergic reaction and said to go to insta care. I did and the provider said I was an allergic reaction. 59 dollars to 173",
        "Why there is no summary or report of the appointment? The appointment was okay, the Dr. said she was gonna send in a request for OTC meds to my pharmacy, got there to pick it up, but of course it wasn't there and they had no idea and since it is OTC just go and pick it up. But what?! No details were given by the Dr about the type of meds and there is no record of it anywhere in the app. So basically the only way yo find out is to have another appointment for another $40....",
        "Unable to enter insurance into BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD not on provided list Unable to edit out mistaken insurance. I have limited computer skills. Filling out the other info was a waste of time.",
        "This app is impressively user friendly and surprisingly easy to navigate. It took only seconds to get logged in and set up for my very first video chat appointment. I'm also pretty impressed with the overall quality of the audio & video. I didn't encounter not one issue, delay or any cause to roll my eyes throughout the whole 75 minute call. Pretty Sweet!",
        "Had an appt for my daughter with the EAP that we waited a couple of weeks for. I downloaded the app and set up an account a week in advance. We joined our appt 15 min early. When the appt time came the provider's video wouldn't connect. We were connected to wifi and had a strong signal. We kept waiting and about 10 min after appt time we got a notification that the provider had canceled the appt. We didn't get a call, the appt was just canceled due to the provider's connectivity problem.",
        "Nice that I didn't have to take off work. Easy to access!",
        "This was my first time using this app for a doctor's appointment and the connection and video all went through smoothly. I had done this with another doctor with a different app prior to this appointment, and the success was not so wonderful, so I was really grateful for how well this went.",
        "Love this app! It has all your history of your health, doctor and ER visits, as well as all of the shots or medications that you have ever been put on with dates and detailed info of visits, or surgeries that you have had in your past.",
        "I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice. It's very difficult when you are trying to do psychotherapy about trauma and halfway through the connection dies or you can't hear your provider anymore. This needs lots of work!",
        "The provider was very concerned about why I was using connect care. She was just a caring person.",
        "The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare.",
        "I waited two hours to be seen, and kept getting canceled on each time I got to my turn on the waitlist. Four different times. I hate leaving negative reviews, but this experience was awful and extremely frustrating.",
        "Installed just to check a covid test result. I see no way of doing that. The only thing I see is how to make an appointment. What a waste if time.",
        "Part 1: Five stars for the app and the concept. My car battery was dead so I couldn't get my daughter to the pediatrician so I finally gave Connect Care a try. I loved my experience! She was diagnosed quickly and I didnt have to drag three kids to the doc. I quickly told my husband how happy I was. Part 2: It's now 16.5 hours later and the prescription HAS STILL NOT BEEN SENT TO MY PHARMACY. The support line and I have done all we can. We're all waiting for Robin Dale.",
        "3 tries, haven't gotten through yet. I know they're really busy right now but I waited in line for an extremely long time and when it was my turn next the wait got even longer and then it hung up on me because the provider left and it just said you won't be charged. No apology, putting me at front if line...Yeah, like being charged was my big concern. Then, got in line again, 7 ahead of me, then 5... Then they suddenly transferred me to a different doc with *11* ahead of me. U of U WAY BETTER.",
        "Very easy to use. Doc. understands my time too. Questions are answered very clearly. Also tech staff to set up is great too",
        "Great, got me in in the early morning hours before urgent cares were even open.",
        "The PA I saw was great, but the app seemed to have issues working properly. I could see my doctor, and I could see my video was being captured by my device, but he had trouble seeing me multiple times during the visit. I know my wifi signal is strong because I used it to work from home today. Not sure what the problem was. However, I did really, really appreciate not having to wait in a doctor's office during COVID-19. I'll continue to use the service again and see if the app works next time.",
        "Connect care is the worst app! I was waiting in line for a doctor for 2 and a half hours when i finally was next in line the system kicked me out! Teladoc is so much better! At least they call you back if you get dropped at the finish line!!!! I would rather go in to the doctor and risk getting sick than dealing with this service! I will not use this service again!! I'm installing it and warning others away from it!",
        "my first experience on here was great. the wait time is what i would have expected (25 minutes or so), but i was able to do laundry while I waited and I didn't have to take my rowdy boys to the clinic. several doctors were on call. Robin was great. She explained to me why i needed an antibiotic and was very nice. I'm sorry for those on here that had bad experiences. I think this was worth 49. Its cheaper than my copay in the office!",
        "I was next to see someone 6 times and got booted back to the beginning, had to reenter my info, and wasted 45 minutes.",
        "From an app standpoint, it performs great and makes for a very easy online appointment. Since this pertains to the app itself I gave it 5 stars. As for the service, typical IHC ineptitude. Wait 2 hours to get the same old \"tell whatever you can to collect a check without doing anything.\" So ended being told to reverse a prescription back to a state that had stopped working and to just take the same medication I've used without any success for the last week. I'm going back to the U, app or not.",
        "The app ran very smoothly. Here are 2 pieces of feedback: 1) While in the waiting room the app should have a pane that shows the patient what their video looks like so they can make sure they are ok with what is going to be seen by the provider. 2) I have a 300 mb internet connection yet my doctor's feed was coming through low res. It may be a problem with the app or the facility may need faster internet, either one would be worth fixing in order to make the experience feel premium.",
        "Probably the easiest and most comfortable medical inquiry experience I have had. Where has this functionality been my whole life?! :) My only frustration was having to set up my profile during the stress of having a medical need. I highly suggest users create their profile at a calm moment before having to actually use the app for a medical need.",
        "The app itself is well made, but my experience made me ask myself \"What's the point?\". I have a sore throat and my ears have been bothering me for awhile so I finally decide to give this thing a shot. There is an option within the app that specifically states sore throat/ear problems. I get in touch with the provider and they tell me that both of those things require an in person evaluation. This is the most minor thing a person could have. If you can't diagnose it on the app what's the point?",
        "I'm very disappointed in the queue. I waited for nearly 2 hours in queue waiting on a doctor they paired me with. I was down to 2 patients ahead of me when I was messaged by the clinic manager saying it was going to be some time before I could be helped. I stayed patient, stuck on 2 in queue, then it dropped me saying the provider is no longer available. I had to restart altogether. After seeing another 15 patients in with a new doctor, I quit. I don't have another >2 hours to waste on here.",
        "The provider was awesome! My experience.. not so much. Yesterday the doctor's assistant messaged me to ask me a couple of things and then to let me know I was next in line. after 2.5 hours waiting. Then 48 mins later i message to ask if it usually takes so long. No response. 10 more mins no response. So I cancel the visit. Dr was offline. Wait 1.5 more hrs get to 1 person left then dr declines my request for visit..no explanation just declined.by 9 Over 6 hrs and never even got a visit.",
        "I was able to address 3 medical needs and get a note excusing me from work. It was so simple. We did get disconnected (my phone's issue) and I was able to jump right back on with the same provider and keep the appointment going. It was awesome!",
        "Great experience. With a toddler running to Urgent Care is hard. It was hard getting connected, as the first provider's call glitched and dropped. I wasn't charged until I successfully talked to a Dr. My sinus infection got bad enough to try this method. I don't have insurance but it was affordable to talk to a dr and get the medical help needed. Thanks IHS team!",
        "Wow! That was so fast and easy! I needed to talk about a prescription, during covid19 pandemic, and I used this alternative way to visit my doctor! Best Appointment ever! Thank goodness for new ways of getting quick health care, without the drive, the wait, or worrying about possibly catching something, from someone else at the clinic! LOVE this app! I highly recommend using it!",
        "It's definitely hard not to have personal contact with your doctor but for the situation at hand overall it's a pretty good experience I just feel that in situations where you need your doctor person to person or face to face in a environment you're comfortable with is better than sitting before a camera but overall is a pretty good experience",
        "Wonderful direct care and right in my own home. App is very intuitive and easy to use.",
        "I loved it at first. The Dr. Was very nice and willing to help. Once they got my money however all help went out the window. I was in excruciating pain for HOURS sending email after email for the dr. To send the medication to the pharmacy. I can see she's available to.take another paying customer. But wont respond to my email. Still waiting......no prescription....in pain. They ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR $49!! I'll never do this again. Horrible experience. We'll see if she ever sends my prescription in. I'm doubtful.",
        "The visit was fine and I didn't have to wait long at all. However, out of the two prescriptions that they called in to my pharmacy, one wasn't there. My pharmacist called and was told that only the patient can call, because reasons. So then I called, sat on hold for half an hour, then someone picked up the line and immediately hung up. I mean, you're completely at their mercy and your only option to contact them is a phone number. So I don't know how I'm ever going to get my medication.",
        "It was great. Communication back and forth with my doctor was great. No hiccups or issues with the app. It was the first time that I used it, but it will be nice if I do t need to answer the health questions every time that I'll use the app."
