        "I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.",
        "I assume it does what it says it does, but it's also caused panic in a bunch of people I know because for example I put in fatigue this morning and it was like YOU MIGHT HAVE COVID. And that caused a panic attack. I'm going to keep it installed so that I can be notified and stuff, but I talked to my doctor and he agreed that I shouldn't look at it so that I don't have daily panic attacks over what's probably nothing.",
        "This app has been working the way it should but this morning the app seems to be a little crazy. It says that bluetooth is off, and it's on, Then also it said my closeness setting is off. I don't know what is going on but the powers to be should fix the problem. Thank you",
        "Solid app. The Bluetooth exposure is very minimal and very very hard to hack. You would be more vulnerable to hacks if you wore a smartwatch with or without the app. The only minor complaint I have is the recommendations being off, but it is only a recommendation and it is not shared with anyone. Only time anything is sent is if you test positive and you get a call from an agent with the Department of Health and they give you a code. I hope this app will make a difference and I expect it to",
        "Overall, this is a great, simple app. It does what it sets out to do. The hacking concerns are unfounded. After the February patch,, older Androids are doing well. Newer was already very hard to. In response to another comment, it recommends you stay home if you have one of the symptoms listed. There is no true \"COVID-specific\" symptom. Some have just diarrhea or rash as their first symptom. SARS-cov-2 creates a viral syndrome and this differs person to person.",
        "I heard about this app on one of the news stations (WNYC maybe?) and was anxious for it to be released. Easy to install and I like the updates. I wish it would ask for some kind of basic health history. I, too, had Covid-19 months ago and am still experiencing relapses at various times. I don't want to be labeled as having Covid-19 while in the middle of a relapse. Can that be worked into the app?",
        "Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
        "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
        "This app uses the Exposure API developed by Apple and Google jointly. If you are within 6 feet of another person with the app for 10 minutes, your phone exchanges a secure Bluetooth token (code) with that person's. Then, if that person gets COVID, you get a notification that you were exposed- because you have their token. There is NO way for this app to see your location. There is NO tracking of your location through the app. It does NOT compromise bluetooth. This app can save lives.",
        "Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
        "Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
        "The app works. I got notified about being in close contact and was able to narrow down where I was that day. I deleted the app 3 days ago (just cause) and was called today about exposure 11 days ago. Not sure why it took so long to be notified but I appreciate it nonetheless.",
        "It's quite a relief having this app. It lets you go about with a little more confidence that no one is near you with Covid. Even for my husband's sake, who's a cab driver upstate and takes full precautions, I don't have to spray Lysol all over him when he walks in the house. There is no invasion of privacy; if someone is near you with Covid you get an alert with a code number. No names at all. Thank you Gov. Cuomo.",
        "Kept telling me I need to turn on Bluetooth although every possible Bluetooth setting was already enabled.. The issue turned out to be that Location also needs to be on - doesn't say this anywhere - and also that Battery Saver was creating a problem. Finally, successful setup! Now to see how well it works.",
        "If you watch this review because you have privacy concern against this app. I can tell you that.... there is \"no concern\". I confirm the app has no access to any personal info in your phone. I use third party product to scan it and confirm this. The application design really ensure that you cannot be tracked. Your privacy is safe. So, go ahead to download it to increase protection for youself.",
        "It lets me report symptoms and logg them. It needs to have the tracing for everybody however. I need to know which areas have covid not which people which are few have the app and who I know of these that download it's zero. People aren't responsible enough and too paranoid to help others. Great attempt on the apps behalf however.",
        "I'm worried as to its accuracy. I'm still waiting for my COVID-19 results, which I'm expecting since around September 24. I haven't felt sick, but given the high amount of asymptomatic carriers idk how reliable this app would be with so many people out on the streets without any knowledge of being infected due to irresponsible testing measures in the city. And yes, I've tried to call several times. No answer and they keep hanging up the phone.",
        "While I appreciate this app and it's goal, the symptom tracker needs some tweaking. One of my chronic health issues shares symptoms with COVID and therefore flags me as potentially having COVID. I've seen others in the reviews have this issue too. Maybe something can be done to fix this?",
        "Cool app my only issue is if you select any of the symptoms you are told to stay home. I understand the abundance of caution, but you can have some of those symptoms and not have COVID-19. My suggestion is unless it is a symptom such as loss of taste/smell or something more specific to COVID-19 one should not be told to stay home.",
        "Google Exposure Notification API is not available on secondary profiles on the same Google device. Also not really useful since most people that really should be using this - schools, clinics, barbers, etc. - are not, and have not heard of this app!",
        "Good but not enough. Data is several days behind. There should be a way to log in if you had a test and log the results. The symptoms tracker does not allow you to quantify symptoms like a runny nose.. what if I have hay fever? This app needs some serious refining to be worthwhile.",
        "I have a problem. When I go to Exposure Check, it has my email address. When I type in a password, it says Try Again. I just downloaded the app today. How did it it get my email address (More like 1 of 4 email addresses. ). How do I tell them that I forgot my password (Again, I just downloaded the app today just about 30 minutes to an hour ago. And how did it get 1 of my 4 email addresses.?)? What password? Update: I figured it out the password. It looks like a very useful app.,",
        "The app is well documented and clearly explains how it works. Spend more than 10 minutes in close proximity with someone else and the apps will exchange a token. No location and other information. All the paranoid scaremongers should read the details before leaving misleading nonsense reviews.",
        "More work on the app is needed. Despite enabling Bluetooth, the app still ask for you to do so; then it hangs. Keep work on it.",
        "Assume this app works, but haven't had any alerts. Also the symptoms are similar to common cold and allergies so that may cause alarm to people.",
        "App is vulnerable and open to code manipulation and attacks via Bluetooth vulnerabilities. Scans via Indeoendsnt analysis software find vulnerabilities that can expose your personal device to attackers. Great idea, but the security is highly flawed for the time being until certain patches are developed by device manufacturers and app developers.",
        "Good app but needs broader compatibility if we're to get a critical mass of users. Easy setup with no account or registration. Everyone who thinks this is some sort of tracking conspiracy should just get rid of their cell phone altogether.",
        "To those with chronic illnesses or a symptom or two like a headache: Covid doesn't respect the symptoms of other conditions and diseases. Its symptoms overlap a lot of them. Use common sense. Only note symptoms that are unusual or suddenly more severe. Or don't use that feature at all. You can still use the closeness sensing (or not) or you can just look at the NY data. And this app will not sell your personal info to Putin, send sexts to your boss, or eat your baby.",
        "Good probably, but SILLY. it asks how you're feeling, and when I checked the box for a runny nose it gave me a \"sorry you're not feeling well\" page, complete with \"could be COVID19\" warnings. Ridiculous.",
        "This is the easiest way to save lives! It's completely private, the data stays on your phone, no location info is used and all that good stuff. Tell your friends, family, coworkers, local businesses to add their phone \u2014 the more people participate, the more effective it will be.",
        "Wish this had an \"I tested negative\" button for people with symptoms that turn out to be unrelated. Also, I suspect this gives a false sense of security--the main threat is people who don't take this seriously. Those people aren't using this app.",
        "Easy to install and set up. Requires someone who is exposed to reach out to their health department and put in a provided code in order to notify others, so there's a reliance on all users doing their part for this to work.",
        "The app seems fine. I think it would be good to add some stats about app installs, reports from users, etc. The NJ app has this. Also it has been poorly marketed by Cuomo et al. I'm not sure most NYers know it exists",
        "Nothing to report so I guess that is good. However, when I go to check see what exposure checks there are it wouldn't verify me. It's not clear why or if there are settings for this.",
        "I have asthma and allergies. So I have shortness of breath occasionally. This should also be noted in the symptoms checking. It is misleading to associate all shortness of breath with Covid19.",
        "This implements the Google and Apple bluetooth-based contact tracing. Also provided some nice data on how risks are evolving. It's a really great app and a shame more states (or the federal government) haven't done something similar. They really should advertise it more though.",
        "Great app, I just wish it would get some background medical info on you so if you do have a symptom, it doesn't automatically say you might have Covid.",
        "Idea behind the app is great, but this only works if EVERYONE downloads it and does their due diligence of reporting covid. Released for 3 weeks, only 100k+ downloads(not sure if this includes apple side). If people care that much to go through the motions of reporting, putting on a mask shouldn't be an issue on the first place.",
        "This works similar to the Citizen app. The only difference is that this one shows the charts and graphs. My only concern is that many won't download this because of privacy issues or because they just don't understand.",
        "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8As far as I'm concerned everyone is going to get sick at some point. Heck even if vaccine gets you sick, it just lessens the symptoms!!!\ud83c\udfaf Overall I just like having the ability to tell people I've never been exposed!!! Well at least as far as my interactions are concerned, I haven't been notified that I've been you're an exposure yet!! \ud83d\ude05 Praise be to God and thank everybody for all their hard work in developing this App!!!\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u2122\ufe0f\u00a9\ufe0f"
