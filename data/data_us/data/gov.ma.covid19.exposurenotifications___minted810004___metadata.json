        "If adoption were wider, this app might be more useful; but as of 2021-05-01, it looks like there are still more new cases every day than the total number of downloads of this app. So let's get vaccinated and connected!",
        "Looks to be strictly an app that relays if you have been near someone, but not who. Does rely on honor system of self reporting and getting tested. Still seeing if battery life it impacted in a noticeable way. Also - this seems to be almost year too late?",
        "I rarely receive relevant notifications. Brighton is not considered a part of this Mayor's Boston.",
        "Does not give nearly as much data as the NOVID app",
        "The fact the state gov isn't telling people about this renders it useless. If barely 1k people have it, it cannot possibly be a reliable system for contact tracing. Just add it to the pile of lazily enforced covid protections and restrictions.",
        "Does not track you, does not share your identity, so use it!!!!!",
        "Basically useless to me now.",
        "Could never figure out where they got their information and always said I was not exposed.",
        "What took so long?",
        "App came out too late to be of any use in MA"
