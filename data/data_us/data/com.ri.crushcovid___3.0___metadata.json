        "At first it was helpful tracking my help and keeping me up to date with new information. However, it's now been unable to retrieve new data for a couple months and I'm unable to access new information about testing or vaccinations.",
        "Good concept but it stopped tracking, which is a major function of the app. I deleted and downloaded again and still no tracking, so finding a reason to keep hard to come by.",
        "I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the \"No thanks\" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.",
        "I appreciate this app so much that I've kept it on my phone pretty much since day 1, and have let it log my location for the chance that I catch COVID-19 and want to send it in. I just want to do anything I can to help stop the spread. However, this app accounts for 35 PERCENT of my battery usage. There's simply no need for an app to be that power-hungry, just logging my location idly. That, and the fact that it doesn't integrate Google's contact tracing technology, I have to say goodbye for now",
        "My app hasn't tracked my location since Dec 23, 2020. It has said it is \"in progress\" since then.",
        "The app was ok but the most recent update drained my battery worse than a Pokemon go binge, just with the app running in the background. It's not worth having until this issue is fixed.",
        "Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.",
        "Easy install. All you need is to enable gps permissions. Location data is saved on the phone and you can review the locations you went to. I found you can turn off the tracking in the settings by pulling down the menu, swiping left on the crush covid icon, and clicking the cog icon. Then toggle the button to disable. There needs to be a way to turn on and off easier from the top pull down menu. This will allow users to turn off when at home to save battery.",
        "This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.",
        "I am rooting for this app. But there are several problems: 1) I can't access the new version on my Android phone, the \"Let's go\" button doesn't seem to work when trying to boot up the app the first time. 2) I wish it would just keep itself running and send my info continuously, once I have given it permission (I often forget to log in and then it stops sending updates). I know it's trying to respect privacy, but there should be an option for those who don't mind to just let it do it's thing.",
        "Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.",
        "Glitchy and inaccurate. Has not updated my whereabouts in 4 days even though I traveled to the other end of the state where I stayed for four hours. Prior to the last place it says I've been, it also records me being places I have never been (including a street over when I was sleeping in my bed) and missed my entire 30 min grocery shop run. Sent messages to IT but no response. How much did this app cost?",
        "Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.",
        "PLEASE REFACTOR LOCATION TRACKING! Perhaps the sensing approach met privacy goals, battery drain etc., but it's not delivering and some courage is needed (leadership) to face the reality and use or license someone else's proven working tracing approach. (And having to load app manually and keep in a foreground process all the time is plain daffy! When I happen to remember and do it, the location data it gathers is more wrong than right...)",
        "I finally left app with newest Version 2.1. As Android user the new update has changed app for the worse. You can't send info as it just keeps saying u have to fill out info you have already done...and the location tracker is do far off..it has had me listed in Connecticut for hours when I had not left my house in RI.. Until u fix the bugs...I won't use the app. It started off good... programmers...please don't make the users your Beta group! You should have noticed these bugs if u tested!",
        "It is incredibly inaccurate. I live in Cranston. We went to the border of CT and got off the motorcycle for over 30 minutes. It didn't record my location at all that day. Now it's reading I was at Ace Hardware for HOURS. I wasn't there at all. Worthless. UPDATE - MY LOCATION DIARY HAS NOT UPDATED IN 10 DAYS. REMOVING THIS FROM MY PHONE.",
        "I can't even get through the agreement/permissions page. This is my second attempt with this app after the first version was sending alerts and push messages non stop. I guess for every minute I am frustrated trying to use the app, that is a minute that I am less likely to be exposed to Covid.",
        "I stopped keeping my own contact tracker, due to the ease of using this app. I installed it the first day it was released. I just took a look at the log it has kept and found that it stopped working on 5/20 and started tracking once again today. I wish is worked well, but I find it not very reliable at this point.",
        "I have an LG Aristo 2 Plus. App worked great for 1 month. Then it stopped working. When I hit Send after putting in my zip code, it reads:. \"Cannot submit data. Please try again.\". I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Contacted T Mobile. They checked my phone and say it was the app.",
        "I had the app when it first came out and it worked fine until 3 weeks ago then it stopped tracking me. I just got a new Note 10 and it won't let me finish setting it up . Won't respond on last page of setup to allow it to track, etc. So I uninstalled it and am going to try to install it again",
        "After I use symptom diary, the next screen freezes. I have to uninstall the app and then install it again.",
        "The my location diary is not very useful if it's only going to register somewhere I've been for 10 minutes or more. It takes less then a second for somebody to cough or sneeze on you. I went to 3 places today and only one registered in my diary. One of the places that did not register had a worker who was not wearing a face mask. So this place would have been the highest likelihood to get me sick and I wouldn't have been able to track it and the DOH would have inaccurate information.",
        "The location diary is a joke - records places that I have never been near. This is disturbing as I only downloaded for purposes of contact tracing. If tracers were to go by my diary they would be doing a lot of unnecessary work - and, I would hate to be contacted based upon inaccurate data in other users diary. VERSION 2.0 LOCATION DIARY IS WORSE THAN V1.5. HAS ME IN PLACES THAT I LOOKED UP, BUT NEVER WENT TO, IN GOOGLE MAPS. ALSO, HAS ME AT HOME FOR 23HR, 59MIN ONE DAY BUT I TRAVELED TO MA.",
        "Completely inaccurate. This is the wrong solution. Should use Google COVID-19 Proximity Tracking API, which already works. But app relies on ineffective method that (sometimes) stores your (wong) location history locally and then flags you as a contact if RIDOH parameters have been met. So you still have to rely on people correlating information and calling you. Way too many variables will mean very slow, and never complete, adiption. Don't reinvent the wheel.",
        "I can't get past the \"Let's Go\" button on a Pixel 5. This used to work on my Pixel.",
        "This app still doesn't accurately keep track of my location \ud83d\ude12! I did everything suggested to assist it that was given as \"tips\" and it's not right 95% of the time! I always have my phone on and use either data or wi-fi. The only location that it gets correct sometimes is home. If it doesn't get fixed I might as well uninstall it.",
        "While I understand and appreciate the good will and intent behind the creation of this app, the implementation is severely flawed. Using a persistent foreground service with GPS lock is going to significantly drain users battery, to the point where this app will likely become less useful as devices enter battery saving mode or simply turn off. I believe there are better and more user-friendly ways to introduce an experience like this that balance good will while preserving device resources.",
        "I've had this app on my phone for about a month now and I assumed it was keeping track of where I go, apparently that isn't the case because it's only showing two places in a month which is wrong. I also stopped keeping a contact diary after downloading the app and now I will have a hard time remembering everywhere I've been the past month. Luckily I stay home a lot more than I used to but it's not showing any markets or stores I've been to. I think I'm just going to delete the app.",
        "Constantly says that I need to connect to Wi-Fi or mobile which are both connected tried turning each off individually with the same message. I am removing the app from my phone",
        "Completely inaccurate and doesn't stay open. If I haven't clicked on it, it doesn't track anything and it seems to close out on its own. When it IS tracking, the location is incorrect for about 90% of the time. Great idea, poor app.",
        "At first the app seemed to function well with some useful information. However it doesn't work with a VPN enabled. When I try looking at My Location Diary with it says it needs wifi/cellular network. Why is it failing when the VPN is enabled? Why is it going to a server for data when the location diary is supposed to be stored on my phone?",
        "This app is not accurate at all. It will put you two miles from your actual location. It had me at an elementary school in Coventry when I was at Walgreens in West Warwick. When I am home it says I'm in Barrington on the other side of the bay. I'm pretty sure accuracy is important.",
        "I think the point of this app is great. And I don't know if it's my phone or the app but I have been home all day today yet it says I have been to places up the street from me. Like I said, it could be my phone. This hasn't just happened today, but other days too.",
        "Location has never worked even though all settings and permissions have been done. My phone with Google maps me correctly on the few occasions I went out, so I know the phone functions work . What is the problem with this?",
        "On my Google Pixel 3 Android, the app only gives me the options to access location while using the app or to deny location services. There is no option for allow all the time. Thus, my location diary has nothing in it! Also, an excellent feature for this app would be a contact diary.",
        "Location does not work all the time, only if app is running, so it useless, as I can't seem to set it to access location all the time? So the location data is not updating.",
        "In principle it's great. The developer need to patch a few things, though. Also, it doesn't do passive tracking so either the app is open and running or it won't do anything",
        "I am deleting this app. The location data is joke. I have had it installed for 3 days now and there about a dozen locations in the data that say I was there for long periods of time that I have been nowhere near. Useless.",
        "Flawed tracking. Please give option to manually add days/locations when there is no tracking history. Just checking location history today and there's been no tracking since the 20th. App has been running and I had expected that it was working.",
        "This should be integrated with the exposure notification system from Apple and Google. Without it, this app exists in its own tiny silo and won't be successful."
