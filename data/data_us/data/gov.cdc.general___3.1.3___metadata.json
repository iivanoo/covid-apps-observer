        "I've tried several times to get the app to open. All i get is a white screen. I've uninstalled and installed the app several time and it won't open.",
        "I've had this app for maybe a year or two before the Covid-19 pandemic. It used to always be fact and science based, focusing on what you need to know to stay safe! However, recently the \"articles\" have been touting Trump's \"strong and swift action\" in dealing with this virus. I don't need to read a bunch of political BS before getting to the useful information and data! This is really a shameful decline and I will be uninstalling and getting my health and safety information elsewhere.",
        "For \"up-to-the-minute\" reporting, this app is three weeks past due. The CDC direct website is easier to navigate with factual details than this half-assed attempt of an app. My google web browser lends more useful up to date info than this app does. When i attempt to navigate the app it sends me to the CDC website. Think ill save memory space. *delete*",
        "Has great potential. However, during a pandemic you would think devs would update the content occasionally. Covid19 facts and stats worldwide are changing by the moment. This app hasn't updated since I downloaded it early last week making this app pointless and not relevant. It's very scary this is the best the CDC can do with an app for the public.",
        "It's a very confusing app. You see a topic and you cick on it and it takes you to page that does not continue the article and you can't find where the continuation of the article is. Considering how important this app should be it really sucks in getting the info you need...",
        "Worthless. The \"lead\" article is over a week old. Seriously? Why even have an app for the public if you're not going to provide current infotmation? No COVID-19 numbers or statistics. It's not even on the disease list. Ridiculous.",
        "Tried to look up vaccine schedule which worked so well previously. Could not access that without going to the web - then still poor. Yes there is a wealth of information. No it is not as useful as a now incompatible app. Sad.",
        "I think it is a great idea and it's definitely one that should be improved upon. The app falls short in information and in many ways it's easier to navigate the CDC website. Local alerts and information would greatly increase the useful aspects of the app.",
        "Very difficult to navagate. Impossible to find Anything local that actually has a direct impact on me. I live in Oregon, not New York. Yes, it is very tragic what is happening there, but what is going on in Oregon? I get NO tv, so I get no local news. How am I supposed to know what is happening here? For all I know, everyone in Oregon could be zombies.",
        "Absolute scam. Just as useless as the rest of our government. I will never get the coronavirus vaccine.",
        "App does not stay up to date. When you receive a notification and click, it takes you to a blank page. When you check your states info goes to an error page.",
        "I like this app it helps to keep me informed on food outbreaks. ( I'm a cook) very important to have this information. I order thousands of dollars worth of food a month. Plus, very educational on all matter of health. Thank You",
        "A very informative app on Disease and general health protocol. Could have 5 stars if it was easier to navigate and find information such as a search bar to find exactly what I'm looking for.",
        "Disappointing. Not as useful as I expected. Doesn't show up to date info. Just info we've already seen 1000 times. Expected more from the CDC whom I've always respected.",
        "This application was good but I wish it would have a section on were the were the covid-19 was maybe they should work with Google maps to show the information. Like how the escort raider detector application live feed.",
        "I haven't found anything of the issues that others reviewers had using this app. The app works as its claims and then some. Honestly, I really don't know what are they talking about. Happy with the app, so I give a 5 star rating. Case closed.",
        "This app is lacking in many ways. Was hoping for close to real time mapping of the global epidemic crisis on novel coranvirus. Only features journals and publications some of which are outdated.",
        "Same as using the webpage. Useless. Just use the browser and see the same faster. It should have notifications about the alerts they issue but it doesn't.",
        "great for someone who is pregnant and very anxious over anti-vax movements and outbreaks, helps me be on the lookout when my immune system is low and will be even more helpful for future baby on the way to being fully vaccinated!",
        "To me it was filled with useful information, and if necessary I will definitely download the application again for the next update",
        "I was hoping you'd have the numbers of cases on the Covid 19 virus to keep me updated & whomever else decides to add this app?.I'm glad someone has created it though making it easier to check on outbreaks..I'm aware that it's an old virus mutation & newly somehow released or spread that's probably why the techs haven't had the chance to update info..Join the club I can't seem to get much done myself..Life is like a roller coaster..\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc47",
        "Wasn't even able to load any of the reports just home page! Just a waste of time! I was able to get more info of my app News Break & NBC, HLN & Fox!",
        "THE APP IS NOT OPENING UP TO THE PAGES THAT ARE LINKED WITH THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION . ITS A BLANK WHITE PAGE MY ISP INTERNET CONNECTION IS WORKING FINE. ITS YOUR APP NOT WORKING FRIDAY IT WORKED SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BUT NOW ITS USELESS",
        "Ever since the COVID-19 Coronavirus struck the U.S., I want to be more informed and so I installed the CDC app so I can be so. Unfortunately for me however, everytime I tap on notifications fron this app, this app fails to display the news article it notified me about within the app once it starts it.",
        "Good information, But sends several push messages every day and there is no obvious way to turn them off. Makes it a virus in my book. Uninstalled",
        "I mean, why not just use the website? It just seems kinda useless. Maybe if it was a covid-19 exposure tracker, then it may be useful, but it's not so I can't recommend it.",
        "Useful to keep up, especially with the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak, but really annoying design. Harder to help less technically inclined use it.",
        "Very useful, & GPS keep one updated!",
        "It has a lot of information if you want to shift through all of it to find what you want. I can't find a search function so it is easier to Google the web for information",
        "i have a good internet connection but the app hangs when you want to access information. close to useless.",
        "This app is a joke! Major virus outbreak and it sends no notifications at all, despite being asked for notification information. The CDC needs to get a new developer.",
        "Awesome \ud83d\udc4c app that keeps you well informed \ud83d\udc4d on the COVID-19 virus and much more! This is definitely the app that EVERYONE should be using for the most important and useful information about your health \ud83d\udc4d and wellness!!!",
        "Last update Covid-19 date back to 4 days and it's not even an update. This app is poor and cannot be relied upon.",
        "This app is the definition of the cdc. It's late on news, it's not consistent on anything, and work like biden's brains, coumo's hands, and harris' knees.",
        "Case count for covid is not available. Covid information is too bast it lacks its own menu or search box.",
        "I just downloaded this app and it not only covers the coronavirus pandemic, but issues concerning the public. Very informative.",
        "Acts on constructive feedback immediately and a great source of relevant information during a global pandemic. Never mentioned disinfectant injections and also very fact focused.",
        "Questions about symptoms is all grouped together. Choices for different symptoms is really important. I answered YES to symptoms, because I had no choice. Results came up urgent. That's scary. Needs to be more broad.",
        "A lot of info ... easy to find what ur looking for. Thanks Great Job!",
        "To far behind in data and to confusing! Should rank \"0\" stars, but can't post comments without giveng at least 1 star."
