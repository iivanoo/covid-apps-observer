Your symptom checker provided me with advice to make a GP appointment, which I will do. Another less positive aspect, was the upcoming appointments, I have two booked in, they aren't on there. \"Olivia\" the interface to the app was giving me the spiel over how she had access to this and she doesn't., She also has no access for booking appointments. Admin Request - \"Currently, your practice is not set up for this service...\".although Olivia did offer to dial the surgery on my behalf. It needs to be all or nothing for the service, you cant ask people to embrace technology and leaving them not being able to embrace it. Also the implementation of the app for my practice was been poor. No forward notice, no tailored communications of its capability, all the things \"Olivia\" promised should have been available or the welcome messages should not have claimed them. Implementation should have been slicker. I'm happy to discuss this outside of here if you want more feedback, or to hear from an end user. Stephen.",

My two trials seemed to result in long-winded unrelated questions and simply resulted in me being advised to phone 999 or 111 for something that was truly quite trivial - leg pain which cured itself after two days.

This app can only be used for yourself and requires you to register.
