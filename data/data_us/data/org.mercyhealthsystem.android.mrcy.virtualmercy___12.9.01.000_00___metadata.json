        "I love this service! In this day and age, with Covid protocols and the stigma following even the common cold - it was a relief to be seen in less than five minutes and have a prescription ready in less than an hour - without having to disrupt my day. I didn't have to leave my bed! There are obviously instances where going to the doctor is more appropriate, but for the quick illnesses that can be easily diagnosed and treated, this services is A+! 5 GOLDEN STARS!",
        "Needed a simple antibiotic for an ear infection which I get about twice a year. Would not prescribe anything for me, even tough that's listed as one of the benefits of the site. Today, my eardrum ruptured due to the extreme pressure of the infection, causing quite a bit of bleeding onto my neck and pillow. Would a picture of the blood convince anyone of what I needed and did not receive ??? Complained to \" customer service \". Never got a response. Nothing. Time to look for another provider...",
