        "Very happy that my liuna laborer union anthem blue cross blue shield has this option. Especially with my son living with his mother through the week sometimes, and this pandemic. It has taken the issue and barriers of leaving work early & scheduling my son and myself for the same day concurrently after my appointment or vice versa. I very much appreciate this service. I am a union laborer. I've been a pipe layer and built wind farms on nightshift. So some weeks I have 72 hours worked",
        "Logged on as a last-ditch effort to refill a psychiatric prescription before running out, and within ten minutes I was connected to a lovely nurse practitioner who chatted with me about symptoms and wrote the prescription. The app was not clear before making the appointment about whether this particular provider accepts my insurance, but either way, I was happy to get care at a moment's notice on a Saturday morning in my pajamas!",
        "My experience with LiveHealth was delightful. I expected the Dr. to grab her RX-pad to quickly write & refill my prescriptions. But, i was pleasantly surprised to find that she actually took the time to ask me several questions about my underlying condition & I feel quite confident that together we were able to come up with a preventative plan that (over time) will improve my overall health. She was helpful & informative. I will definitely be using this app again, when it's time for a refill!",
        "I had rated this app after looking at what seemed like a double charge on a visit but I called customer service. I learned that one of the transactions went through as what is like a void or a reversal. It's like when you go to the gas station & get charged twice but you get a reversal on the extra charge. I came back here to change the rating I made but Google Store here wouldn't let me make a 3rd edit (I had added additional info on the original rating, first rating). Call customer service!",
        "App is very frustrating. Filled out my information and accidentally put in my credit card instead of my HSA card. I immediately cancelled and later, I received an email from my CC company stating my credit card was charged. I had to start over entering all my my information along with my son's ailments. I selected to see the first Dr. available. The app said someone would be with me soon. No estimate on how much time so I am sitting staring at my phone thinking soon would be 5 minutes.",
        "I set up a doctor appointment for my sleep, waited 16 minutes in the waiting room after the set appointment time, only to be told that he's unavailable. I would rate him but so far I'm unable to find his information or even asked why he's declined to see me as a patient today. So far this app has been the worse to appointments, I'm giving it one more chance with a therapist to see if it's any better this round.",
        "I downloaded this app with some pretty strong reservations and doubts about how doing virtual appointments would help me. I have to say that I am more than happy. The therapist and psychiatrist that I work with are really vested in my mental health and have been a godsend! I definitely recommend this app!",
        "Access to lots of doctors of all kinds almost instantly, my prescription was ready an hour later and the only thing I left the house for was to pick up the medicine. Far exceeded my expectations.",
        "Camera won't connect. This is a huge failure, and the idea had so much promise. There are problems with the camera on my phone connecting every time. I'm very disappointed.",
        "Amazing!! I was about to leave my home at 2:30am on Christmas Day because I was feeling so bad. I grabbed my insurance card and noticed the 24/7 nurse helpline. She then informed /directed me to the app and I'm soo glad she did. I didnt have to leave my bed, talk to a great Dr, got my prescription and I'm so happy.",
        "Hubby's work suggested this app. It is great. Saw a doctor within minutes and he was really nice, professional and courteous. He helped out with what we needed and everything was taken care of in a short amount of time.",
        "Sometimes there are glitches like loss of volume ,or one day we couldn't connect at all but over all I like it.",
        "App was useful for a couple of months but it hasn't had available providers for months now. I scheduled an appt with a doctor a month in advance and was cancelled with no notice the day of. Useless and demeaning.",
        "Absolute garbage. The app itself feels like a 90s webpage and it's abysmal in terms of managing it's providers. Mine vanished without a trace, leaving me with needing a prescription renewal and the only way to get one was to spend another $175 on finding a new provider in the app. What's the point if you have no doctors continuity? And if this happens only occasionally, why wasn't I informed? Absolute trash -- find a better platform than this for yourself, honestly.",
        "Really makes life easier! Having 2 littles at home, no vehicle and all the restrictions due to covid about bringing more than one person to the appt creates a TON of stress for myself. Thankful!!",
        "This is a scam. They took my payment then sat on a waiting screen for 30 minutes and no dr ever came to the appt. The number listed is not working either. This is a total scam and should be illegal.",
        "$59 for a visit, the doctor recommended that I receive a COVID-19 test but the catch is, no testing sight within a hundred miles of my area would take the recommendation because this company can't send it in a fax. Had to be seen for another visit and evaluation in person and pay ANOTHER co-pay to get tested. Wasted $59 dollars. Great virtual doctor and was able to prescribe non-conrtolled substance medication, just that they're basically treated as illegitimate by actual health care facilities.",
        "I have used this app a few times. It is great to put your mind at ease and not have to load up and troop in to the dr.'s and then wait. Its fast and answers most of our questions with real dr.'s. It makes the the dr. office experience changed for the better. We only do office appointments if we have to be in person. Its a great app.",
        "LiveHealth Online was super easy to use. Choose your provider answer a few questions and visit your chosen provider all from the comfort of your home. Very convenient will definitely use this app again.",
        "The app is convenient but the doctor I had was rude, didn't really listen to my issues and kept interrupting me.",
        "There was a wait of about 15 minutes & no getting out in the nasty weather. Dr. Whyte was very easy to speak to & made me feel at ease. Great experience!",
        "Excellent from start to finish. Very well organized app. Quick visit got the help I needed.",
        "Super easy. Though i should warn others : if you love video chat , you need good WiFi. The app will tell you that you need WiFi and plus it's difficult to load pictures. But i was able to talk to a doctor and got my answers. I didn't need to wait too long.",
        "I really like this app, it's pretty user friendly, I've always been connected to a doctor in under 10 mins, they have a large selection of doctors to choose from and the doctors have all been really awesome. They accept my anthem blue cross so I've never had to pay out of pocket. Great job!",
        "I have been using Live Health for years and the service has always helped me when I am struggling.",
        "Worst medical app I've ever used. My card was charged 4 times and all the \"doctor\" did was tell me to go somewhere else. Never using again and I'm filing to get my money back.",
        "Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.",
        "Overall excellent experience. Dr Antall seemed very knowledgeable and confident and concerned with my issues and made some suggestions on how to get better results. She also made sure I understood her directions on following up with my pcp.",
        "Was pretty well impressed all the way around now maybe it's cuz I'm a little older but I think that it's pretty cool and it works well this was my second time using it and the doctor was a normal regular guy with English as first language and everything I highly recommend it for anyone including my own family",
        "First time using app. First time I did an appointment, the doctor had to cancel due to technical issues. I wasnt charged for it. The second time I was able to get ahold of a doctor and she was very nice. Recommend if you are unable to make a same day appointment with doctor.",
        "This app is amazing and I love my new therapist, easy to navigate and get help",
        "I had a pleasant experience with this app. I selected a provider, provided some information and went to a video chat. It was straight to the point and I would use this method again for my medical needs.",
        "Quick, convenient, very easy app to navigate. Dr. was very thorough. Will definitely use again!",
        "GREAT! This was the most convenient thing I've ever tried. The doctor was so welcoming, I felt very comfortable. I would rather use this anytime then actually having to go to an actual office. This is fast, efficient, convenient. I'm just so pleased.",
        "Very convenient! Dr was very caring and concerned. It made getting care so easy when I may not have gone through the hassle to make and go to a Drs office because my time is extremely limited and I'm nervous about exposure. Thank you!",
        "Great experience. Easy to use app. The doctor was prompt and thorough.",
        "Great first experience! First time I used the app and it ran smoothly. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the video to submit pictures wouldn't work.",
        "This app has made my life so much easier! It is easy to navigate and they provide the services that you need.",
        "10 out of 10 customer service. Had some issues with video connection with one doctor and LiveHealth quickly fixed the problem and went beyond and above what they really needed to do. This is the only company I'll ever use when I need to see a doctor online. They really care about the people and not just about money like most the companies. Thank you again guys!!",
        "This was my first experience with using the app. I am very pleased with the efficiency of scheduling an appointment the same day and my therapist was very helpful. I will use this app again."
