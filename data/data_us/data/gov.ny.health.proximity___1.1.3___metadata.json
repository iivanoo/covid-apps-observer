        "Invasive use of solicitation to user by recommending via notification outside of the app store. I should not be getting push notifications that override my settings for these to be unable to do so. Google and affiliates are invading users privacy by doing so.",
        "App can be manipulated for false positives. After providing symptoms, it tells me unfortunately and I may have Covid-19, yet these symptoms are for a different diagnosis that someone like myself deals with due to other health reasons. So basically this app is not fool proof and cannot be taken seriously. I'm now uninstalling it and hope that no residue applications within the app has been left behind in my device as some apps do leave behind unwanted features. Use at your own discretion",
        "It's a well designed app and is useful even if only for a convenient way to keep an eye on the charts. Of course the fact that it's opt-in is a limitation, but I really don't understand the complaints on this. People are saying they've never gotten an exposure notification like it's a bad thing. Are you sick with covid-19? If not, then what is the complaint exactly? You want false alarms?",
        "Randomly popped up with a notification even though I'd never had it installed. Basically tricked me into installing based on the assumption that it was trying to warn me of a potential exposure.",
        "I have it installed. With such an allegedly important tool that could save life's it really is discouraging that it only relies 9n Bluetooth. Even a ping of data could provide enough location for triangular based location. Uninstalling, scientific based precautions will help. Not on a COB Job cell phone app, and also this is a lesson for the people of NY also. Common sense and caution will benefit not this. C",
        "Caused 6 other apps to fail and stop working. Uninstalled from phone, but still getting this apps notifications when Bluetooth is disabled. Very disappointed. Not recommended.",
        "Easy to use. I will check in on it everyday to report my health condition. I am healthy now. I am looking for a vaccination. I guess that's a different app.",
        "Pointless if no one else uses it. At this point I trust other people as far as the magic yellow lines in the road.",
        "my bluetooth always on cause my wireless ear buds. I work in a clinic that does covid testing and people who have symptoms for covid. not 1 notification.",
        "Why does this have such bad reviews, it works perfectly fine for me! Love the design too.",
        "its a good app, but some times i receive alarm when no one close to me, fix it please",
        "12/26 I got an alert that someone was close to me for a prolonged time with Covid. The worst part was getting tested which seemed like it was more difficult then it needed to be and finding a testing cite was annoying and Imo this is a PUBLIC health crisis and ALL testing should be free. I had to go to a place and pay for a test. I was satisfied with this app because I was warned! So for that I'm happy. I was able to be proactive. I was negative in the end so this worked at least for me.",
        "This app is full of security holes. Leaves your Bluetooth open to vulernability. It's a great concept, but I work from home and I'd rather not risk (more) identity theft",
        "The app itself is fine. But the problem is the effectiveness of this app is limited by how few people install it. If you're the only person in town who has this app, it's useless. I've never received a notification from this app ever. I live in an area with almost 9% infection rate. I live in an apartment building and I've been out to supermarkets, etc. Not a single alert. As long as the app is not mandatory, it's pretty useless.",
        "This is stupid. Google the CDC weekly flu numbers and you'll see all these Covid numbers are actually flu. There's 23 total flu for 1 week in USA but a billion covid cases? Bullcrap. They just want to do \"the great reset\" .",
        "Just tested positive. Tried to send a notification to all codes I've come into contact with and app requires 6 digit code from a contact tracer. 1. So I'm going to sit here not being able to notify anyone until a contact tracer calls me? A day can mean the difference between life and death. 2. Give us the option to edit our symptoms today. I usually do it in the morning but developed a symptom this afternoon but it was too late, I had already submitted for the day.",
        "Data respected/reflected /time travel to the end of Pandemic",
        "Says my Bluetooth is off, but it is on (following the link to settings changes nothing) and the only other option is to turn it off. I have no idea how this app works because I was under the impression it was working this whole time and can't turn Bluetooth on when it already is on. BT works fine for my headphones its weird that this app says its not on.",
        "The closeness sensing won't work if your phone is in battery saver mode (at least with my phone). If your Bluetooth + location are both on and you're still getting errors, try turning off battery saver/power saving mode.",
        "I give it 1 star and a thumb up, that's for all information you can find on this app. But I can't give more stars because the most important feature of this app is to let others know that you get tested for Covid, but it doesn't work! The code you are supposed to get from a Trace worker doesn't work, so the app can't (anonymously) send out important information and contact other people or their devices... (I reinstalled the app, turned of/on bluetooth, and tried multiple codes = nothing worked)",
        "All of these apps need to work together, not try to supercede each other. People who travel should not need to switch which app is doing sensing depending on which state they are in. If this is the fault of state health departments, they need to stop the bickering and all work together",
        "Overall, this is a great, simple app. It does what it sets out to do. The hacking concerns are unfounded. After the February patch,, older Androids are doing well. Newer was already very hard to. In response to another comment, it recommends you stay home if you have one of the symptoms listed. There is no true \"COVID-specific\" symptom. Some have just diarrhea or rash as their first symptom. SARS-cov-2 creates a viral syndrome and this differs person to person.",
        "I will say, recently in our area we've had an outbreak. The app was scanning daily to see if anyone in the vicinity had reported symptoms. This will only work if everyone down loads this and enters symptoms or lack thereof often.",
        "I wish there was a slot on the symptom list for noting seasonal allergic reactions. Also, I was directed to NYS alert app when I installed the covid one. That is annoying, be cause it alerts me to problems far from my home. I'll Soon delete it.",
        "Solid app. The Bluetooth exposure is very minimal and very very hard to hack. You would be more vulnerable to hacks if you wore a smartwatch with or without the app. The only minor complaint I have is the recommendations being off, but it is only a recommendation and it is not shared with anyone. Only time anything is sent is if you test positive and you get a call from an agent with the Department of Health and they give you a code. I hope this app will make a difference and I expect it to",
        "I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.",
        "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
        "Simple, Easy, and Fast. The \"Covid Alert NY\" app is simply fantastic. I've been using the app for over 2 months now and I don't have any complaints with the app. This app will notify me if I come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for Coronavirus. Another great aspect of the app is it gives me up-to-date information on all positve and negtive Covid-19 test in New York State. The app breaks down the data for the whole state and also shows you your Local County data too. 5 Star app.",
        "Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
        "Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
        "Could be more useful and informative. Details related to current current zone level and useful misc subjects should be added. User provided information to include self reporting of testing, type of testing, postive/false-positive/negative results, and self/state/organization/employer imposed quarantine. Application update/\"whats new\" information needs to be detailed, rather than a general out of date blanket statement describing the application.",
        "I heard about this app on one of the news stations (WNYC maybe?) and was anxious for it to be released. Easy to install and I like the updates. I wish it would ask for some kind of basic health history. I, too, had Covid-19 months ago and am still experiencing relapses at various times. I don't want to be labeled as having Covid-19 while in the middle of a relapse. Can that be worked into the app?",
        "I understand privacy but for this app to truly work.... work related we make house calls but ask a series of questions before we enter the home. They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.",
        "Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
        "Cant really use it for now. Bluetooth on and when I try to set it up ,the button for closeness alert won't work. I even uninstalled the app and reinstalled same thing. I really would like to be alerted. Please help. I have emailed also. I will change my rating once the app works for me. Thank you.",
        "Cool app my only issue is if you select any of the symptoms you are told to stay home. I understand the abundance of caution, but you can have some of those symptoms and not have COVID-19. My suggestion is unless it is a symptom such as loss of taste/smell or something more specific to COVID-19 one should not be told to stay home.",
        "This app uses the Exposure API developed by Apple and Google jointly. If you are within 6 feet of another person with the app for 10 minutes, your phone exchanges a secure Bluetooth token (code) with that person's. Then, if that person gets COVID, you get a notification that you were exposed- because you have their token. There is NO way for this app to see your location. There is NO tracking of your location through the app. It does NOT compromise bluetooth. This app can save lives.",
        "Dosen't Work, No Support. I click turn on & nothing happens. Bluetooth is on. NFC on. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Updated my phone. Installed again same problem. I wrote the developer over 4 days ago no response. Only an automated message: thanks for doing your part to stop the spread. SGS9.",
        "App is vulnerable and open to code manipulation and attacks via Bluetooth vulnerabilities. Scans via Indeoendsnt analysis software find vulnerabilities that can expose your personal device to attackers. Great idea, but the security is highly flawed for the time being until certain patches are developed by device manufacturers and app developers.",
        "Kept telling me I need to turn on Bluetooth although every possible Bluetooth setting was already enabled.. The issue turned out to be that Location also needs to be on - doesn't say this anywhere - and also that Battery Saver was creating a problem. Finally, successful setup! Now to see how well it works."
