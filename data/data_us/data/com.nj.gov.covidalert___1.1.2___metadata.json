        "Decent app, bad support. Tested positive with a quick test in December, got a call from a contact tracer about a week later. Answered questions, then asked, \"Do you have a code number for me to put into the app?\" Lady didn't know about code numbers or the app. Colleague got COVID, contact tracer called. Again, no question about app or code numbers. No point to the app if code numbers aren't delivered. Otherwise, it's just propaganda. 2 stars.",
        "Still does not work for me. Tried turning off WiFi & Bluetooth\u2014no difference. Gives \"Error 104\" \u2014totally unhelpfull. Uninstalling. For those complaining about vaccine being unavailable, well it is NJ. We don't do anything sensibly. In my area, there 3 websites (State, Atlantic Health & RWJ). All are unconnected, so need register on all 3\u2014and wait. Seriously? \ud83d\ude20",
        "I LOVE THIS APP! I Live In Essex County, NJ Which Is The 2nd Highest In The State. While Taking NJ Transit Yesterday, I Actually Received An Exposure Alert While On The Bus! I Immediately Got Off The Bus, And Waited For The Next One, And The Exposure Alert Stopped!",
        "Has done what it says. As long as other people have this on their phone you are safer. It always you if someone nearby has had covid-19, as long as they use the app.",
        "Uninstalling. Does not give exposure alerts. I did not update the app to say I had covid, but the state knows and called me. I don't get exposure notifications when I'm at my house. The whole reason I downloaded this was to be notified of possible exposure and I have never gotten a notification ever. Waste of time.",
        "\u0139eads you to believe it will let you know where to get vaccinated. Nj has the worst system as it relates to vaccines. It so simple, every area code has there own site, if you prove you live in that zip, you can get vaccinated. Its a no brainer, but the state has NO CLUE!!!",
        "It's fine for the State of NJ tracking you. But, if you like me are struggling to get vaccinated it is totally useless, much like the State of NJ's vaccine site.",
        "Has ANYONE on this review thread been notified of a positive Covid-19 contact? Anyone? I was encouraged to download and use this app when I was first tested in Union County. I checked in with my status every day, for many months. I have NEVER been notified of a potential Covid-19 exposure. As a first responder, I know that I have been within close contact with dozens of Covid-positive people. I have lost confidence that this is a valid weapon against the continuing pandemic.",
        "I would like to see data where my phone randomly had contact with another device?",
        "It's the best app and with very accurate information.",
        "Don't work!! Just useless. Deinstalling.",
        "Had 1st shot. 2nd scheduled for 10th of March. But I have a head cold & a mild sore throat with a dormant ache in my chest!",
        "This app plus $1.50 geta you the star ledger. Useless.",
        "THIS IS NOT A VACCINE APP. IT IS A CONTACT TRACING APP- THAT'S IT (for everyone complaining that it won't help them find a vaccine distribution center)",
        "This app is useless to users. I've been close, very close, to at least 5 people who have all gotten Covid, none of them caused any notification to my app. I also know that the contact tracers were only asking if they knew about the app, not to do anything to trigger the positive notifications. I know notifications are on because I get one monthly to remind me it's running, well, got one monthly, I have since uninstalled it because it's useless to me as an end user.",
        "Doesn't help where you can be vaccinated & when",
        "What happens when you get vaccinated? How does the app know?",
        "I think the app is great. Very informative. It's all in one spot. You do not have to have bluetooth on all the time. You can switch it on when you would like to use it then switch it back off. Without bluetooth you are still able to access and use all of the other features like covids daily numbers local/global/etc and also you are able to check in with how you are feeling and report symptoms..just another tool in the fight against covid.",
        "For the elderly or those who cannot walk long distances, there is no information on which site is best; I am in category 1b. Everytime I search for a location. I am re-routed back to this site which I have already registered.",
        "Not very useful. The app only works, if someone who had or has COVID is using it too! It DOES NOT just detect people with Covid and alert you. I uninstalled it after a week of nothing and especially after 5 people tested positive where I work and the app never alerted me! It's really a waste of time.",
        "Death transparency is gone. What are you hiding?",
        "This app needs improvement. When you get an exposure alert it doesn't tell you the date of exposure, just that it was within the past 14 days. So you could already be out of the quarantine period or only need to test and isolate for a few days. Giving the date of exposure seems important.",
        "Work in an emergency room and downloaded to see how accurate the alerts would be. I assumed I would have to turn off the notification from being alerted to much. To my surprise I haven't been alerted once in over a month of having the app even after being in direct patient care with positive cases.",
        "Absolutely worthless. Contracted covid from a person that contracted covid while in hospital. The contact tracer was not able to get the 6 digit code I needed for the app. Also Drs are refusing to test likely positive people. There's no way to use the app as intended without a test or a code, don't bother with the invasion of privacy.",
        "I tested positive yesterday, but there is no way to tell the app. I can only report symptoms. Apparently I need a 6 digit code from some health department to let the app know I was positive. So until I get that code nobody who was in proximity to me will get a notification and will therefore keep spreading the 'rona.",
        "Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.",
        "During setup I realized that it requires both GPS and Bluetooth to be engaged. If I do this with my phone, it would die in 4 hours. I'm an emergency service personnel, I can't go with a dead phone all day. Sorry. Good idea but won't work for me.",
        "Unfortunately b cause of the blue tooth ne don't to be on it has caused issues with my phone. In which I have issues turning off and or turning on manually the bluetooth. It has also cause phone to lock up. This is causing issues with hands free calling. Uninstalled app.",
        "I am not leaving my Bluetooth on everywhere I go which isn't far but this will take a long time to get enough peoples info and get them on board before you can do that! Ifmt feels intrusive as well. Never leave your Bluetooth on unless you know what your hooked up to.",
        "Not very useful.: 1. You must have and utilize a smart phone 2. You must have it activated 3. You must report your status daily 4. You must be in close contact with an infected person for too long and they must have reported they have symptons 5. Will it be compatable with apps from other states",
        "Cannot even finish setup poor development. Simple alert app should not be inconvenient to use if it is most people won't go through the headache of setting it up. This fix should be top priority. Poor development something like this should be more easily usable.",
        "Graphs of the data are basically useless without the ability to filter on the last 30 days. The data from March-April dominates the plotted ranges which makes it difficult to determine the actual covid cases and deaths that are occurring now.",
        "I feel like if more people used this app it could help in lowering the cases in NJ. So the app senses if you come in contact with somebody that has covid. I have not ever been contacted so I'm not really sure if enough ppl are using the app or if I have been really lucky. Im pretty sure more people need to have the app in order for it to make a difference.",
        "I have this app in my phone but in order to make it more effective it needs more advertise and insist ppl to download it. It can only work more ppl uses and learn how to use it properly. I also not sure myself when its says it use bluetooth in order to make it work. Does it mean I require to wear actual blutooth on my year? Many ppl didnt even know that NJ has this app. Otherwise its a good idea.",
        "Your \"ENABLE EXPOSURE ALERT\" button has not worked since its launch. Gone into settings > exposure alert > enable and NOTHING. Have an Android phone but know of iPhone users with the same problem. Located in Morris County, NJ. PLEASE FIX THIS!!",
        "It has check in every day and also has alerts if you have been near a person with Covid 19.",
        "I spend most of my time at home, and this app constantly harasses me to turn on my location. I use my phone a lot, and I don't want to waste the battery. This is more inconvenient to me than it is helpful.",
        "Totally useless. We had people saying they had it just to set off red flags. This is based on the honor system and that hasn't been something people done in a very long time.",
        "Keeps telling me it can't track exposure always even tho i enabled location. Useless.",
        "I get to the getting started screen and my phone freezes and then says app isn't responding. I've tried on WiFi, ice tried with WiFi off. Same result each time."
