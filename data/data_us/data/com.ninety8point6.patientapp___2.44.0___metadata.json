        "I was so against these types of things, but my company got it for us. I have had a string of bad luck and have had to use this app twice in less than a week. It has been amazing, very fast, people always polite. It helps if you know a little bit about what's going on with you. I would definitely recommend this app,it has been a much appreciated option.",
        "This is supposed to be text-based. I logged in to try and get care for a simple issue. I got as far as entering my name and phone number before the on-screen guidance asked if a video chat was ok. The options were Yes or End Visit. This is a bogus program.",
        "So far, I've had ONLY good experiences using this app. It's super easy to use and safer and more efficient than venturing into a clinic for things that can just as easily be diagnosed via text and photo communication.",
        "My wait time was only 2 minutes and the doctor was very attentive and asked the right questions and allow me to share what normally works best for me! It was a very pleasant experience and it took no time at all to get the help I needed!",
        "Takes a couple minutes to get through all the basic questions but its a great bridge and time saver especially on the weekends.",
        "I was skeptical of using this service at first. But when my Dr told me I had to wait till March to see him, I gave it a shot. Got an appointment within minutes. It was a nice hybrid text/video appt and very convenient. I needed a follow up to release back to work and that was done through text with the same Dr as before within 20 min start to finish. Will definitely use again",
        "This app almost seems to good to be true. Been using it a year now. Visit a doctor anytime, from anywhere for a dollar a visit (plus $120 annual fee) App works great and the doctors really listen. I love being able to talk to a doctor over chat. I don't have to worry about setting up a webcam, or family members overhearing the visit. Not a full replacement for an in person doctor, but for things that can be diagnosed remotely it's more convenient, and less stressful than going in person.",
        "I love this app! It's very convenient and easy to use. All your questions and concerns are answered by a doctor. It saves time by not having to go to a doctors office.",
        "Quick, easy, professional. Great for little nagging issues that aren't bad enough to schedule an actual doctor visit for.",
        "Excellent experience! Doctor helps you step by step. Would recommend this app who's insurance allows it.",
        "The first time i used this app was great...after that it was useless.. The drs didnt want to do anything to help me and suggested i go to a dr... I have no insurance and my normal dr is a low income clinic that takes months to get an appt at... And i cant afford an er visit each time i need a medication refilled... And it wasnt even a narcotic medication or anything along those lines... So whats the point of this app??",
        "This app is the best thing they've done with smart phones in A long time. The physicians I've chat with are all really nice and helpful. I don't have insurance and to pay 120 a year for this is life changing. They've helped with so much including mental health issues like depression.",
        "This is a very handy service. As a mom of 4 I have seen my share of minor issues but sometimes they need a doctors signature for treatment. It was convenient to NOT make an appointment and go in office to get a prescribed medication I knew from experience, would do the trick.",
        "Useless. I have used the app three times. Each time the result was a big fat nothing. Each time i then went to Urgent care , around $140-$150, and was told I have a sinus infection and was subscribed an anti-biotic. I thought the hole point was to forgo the office visit and use these physicians.",
        "I had throbbing aches to the back of my right side of my head and times to my neck and tight shoulders to realize it could be a muscle strain.",
        "So, take it for what it's worth, I have only used this app for 3 days. In those 3 days, I had 2 appointments, they are $1 each plus $20 to register. As far I know, that is the cheapest doctor's visit possible. I th I'll nk you can do telehealth for free with most insurance. This is essentially telehealth but, text based. I recently retired from 20 years in the Army and haven't been able to get my insurance (USFHP) to cover any health care since retiring. So, finding this has been a relief.",
        "Such a smooth process! I did answer some questions initially before talking to a doctor but it's no different than going to an office. The doctor was professional and courteous. I will definitely use the app again!",
        "Good experience overall. Though keep your symptom description to bullet point summary. It said \"in detail\" but my \"narrative\" description was timed out and I had to start the visit over.",
        "I've used this app for a medical emergency and I was treated great. Used it twice and was treated for my condition. The drs are excellent. They can only diagnose what you tell them so be very thorough with your symptoms.",
        "The doctors are always happy and helpful. It is quick and helps when you have those quick questions.",
        "This is a very easy app to use and it is so convenient to check up on simple heath concerns. I find the doctors to be good and thoughtful as well!",
        "So convenient and easy to use, especially when my regular doctor's office is so busy, so I cant always schedule an appointment there in a reasonable time frame.",
        "This app is simple and to the point! There's not much else you can ask for. It quickly connects you with a doctor and is very easy to use. My only suggestion is that I wish there was a dark mode.",
        "Easy to use and quick, they answer questions and give results. For me the service is free due to the plan I have.",
        "App was easy to navigate and use with tele health patient subscription and for participating in a text message based doctors visit. The app disables screen shots apparently for legal reasons",
        "I've used this app twice now. Both times have been quick and easy and I've been satisfied and confident with the recommendations of the doctor.",
        "Doctor was great, app covered a whole lot of questions.",
        "I've used this a few times now and the doctors are very responsive and supportive regarding my issues. This is definetly the best option to use in general and on a pinch.",
        "It's very convenient to be able to see a doctor from the comfort of your own home. I feel like this is the future of Medicare, And can't wait for a video endoscope to be able to show your throat nose & ears to the doctor",
        "Very easy to use and got a quick response from a doctor about my wrist pain. She was able to diagnose the issue and recommend next steps.",
        "Quick and easy. The wait time was MUCH less than estimated! That was nice!",
        "A great way to see a doctor... Especially if you just need a prescription renewed with new labs without having to go through the hassle of an office visit.",
        "Fast, responsive, and simple to use. So relieved to have this service!!",
        "Amazing experience, very prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommended",
        "The Dr's on here don't listen and definately won't prescribe medicine. I clearly had an URI and they said to just rest and take allergy medicine. Went to my Dr and they immediately prescribed an antibiotic. Similar experience prior. This is a joke and GIANT waste of time!!",
        "Second time using i got help right away. Received doctors not for work and got medication prescription. as little as $30 for 3 months of subscription to 98point6,i would of paid over $500 alone for a visit to the doctors or emergency room",
        "Its just the right thing to have in this day and time. Its a way of getting to talk to a doctor without evwn leaving the house and it cuts down io v ER visits. I think its great.",
        "Faat and easy for simple things that you need quickly but would be a chore to do the traditional way.",
        "This service is great! Easy to use and I have always had very good doctors! It's a life saver these days!",
        "I'm so glad I got this app. It is well worth the cost to be able to see great doctors whenever you need to. Thank you for A-1 service!"
