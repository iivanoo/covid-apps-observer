My experience was worse than terrible it is very disturbing. I never spoke to a Dr. But was charged $49.00 ! the ui acted on my behalf so it was like the ai took over with its own dialogue based on very vague questions and my vague replys. based on this the Dr.  Actually wrote treatment notes; once again without any input from me! And i waited all day for him to contact me which he never did! I tried calling customer service several times as well but got an answering machine until finally 5 or 6 hours later i spoke with someone who was utterly  useless. After taking my money without having any communication with me but writing a treatment plan several hours later i was stunned and livid. What really got me was the cs rep said they have\" strict rules  not to contact or bother the Dr's bc they have other practices this is just a side job etc, etc!\" This was beyond  appalling! I was glad the call was recorded bc it proves everything I'm saying is 100% truthful! This really is so egregious in my opinion that a Dr. Has a consult with ai, nothing from me, writes a worthless treatment plan, does not help at all then charges me! Just so wrong!",

DIRTY PRACTICE. First of all, this is the first email they have mentioned that I'm even being charged at all. I looked at their past emails, and I was \"followed up\" by Support a total of two times, NOT mentioning I was being charged. Second, the other emails I've received from them are all but trash; the kind of stuff you would find via a simple Google search, for free, crap like \"7 Easy Ways to Manage Your Stress.\" THAT's worthy of a \"Prime Subscription\"?

        "content": "I feel that not only is the service important, but how it's presented. As a result, I could not help but notice, from the beginning that the resource captured my attention, right away. The bright colors and music were not overwhelming, but just enough for me want to see what was being featured. Once the information was presented, those speaking did not take attention away from the message. I felt the information was straight to the point and quite informative, in a short amount of time. Some favorable things regarding the doctor helping over the phone: It was a triage being conducted in the comfort of the home - especially with the doctor having access to the medical records; the doctor communicated with the parents and the patient; they could see one another; lastly, this allowed one less person to unnecessarily clog up the ER. There were just a couple of unfavorable details: The doctor is able to utilize all necessary senses, except touch; secondly, the doctor's glasses presented a distracting glare on the screen, when she was talking to the family.",

Don't have an issue right now, so don't need the app, but will be excited to try contacting my physician and setting up appointments. Seems easy-to-do. Doesn't seem to allow you to add family, but I will need to investigate the app more. This would be a huge plus.",
