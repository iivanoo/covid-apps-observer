        "Recent update broke ability to view results because date of birth can't be changed from year 2001. Will revise review when fixed. Update: the developers instruction does fix the DOB entry problem but it really should not be so complicated. The previous DOB interface was frustrating as well but it did work. Not sure why it is so complicated. Upgrading to three stars as most people still won't be able to figure out the DOB trick.",
        "App is not working. I enter my information and it keeps giving me an error message saying \u201csomething went wrong. Please try again\". The birth dates are correct, but it still doesn't work. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if it would fix it. Nothing!",
        "Cannot change birth year. Awful. Need to check my test result and can't! Have tried changing the birth year first, and every other way. It does not work. Reinstalling the app changes nothing either. Please help!",
        "Very good app! Functions as described! Thank you very much developers for creating something like this! It is greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude42!",
        "You need to put TEST RESULTS date on the test. Because of this I was unable to fly international even though I was negative and in compliance of the 72 hr period.",
        "Would not let me change birth year. Did receive fast support text saying I heeded to enter year first, which I did and then it worked. They have a fix planned for next revision.",
        "I'm annoyed. Got a message my results were available, but I had to download an app. When I finally got to request the results. Zip. No results available! Grr",
        "So I'm just going to assume someone would call me if I'm positive. At first I couldn't change my birthdate. And now I can, but I can't press the confirm button because it's blocked by my home key and the app doesn't rotate. A year into this, there's no excuse that this app is so bad.",
        "Great site and very fast with no issues. Definitely 5 stars",
        "Wow. This App works great. Very simple and smart. Thank you!!\ud83d\ude18// Esta App trabaja excelente. Muy sencilla e intuitiva. Gracias!!!",
        "Works now! However I wish you didn't have to enter the year first as it's counter intuitive.",
        ". .horrible experience! After 1/2hour trying to put in my birth year,it never worked! I needed to see my covid test results! App is not working!",
        "Says it sent text with my pin to my cell phone, but nothing came. Tried several times without success.",
        "I have put my birthdate, and for my husband as well, and it continues to go back to the date already on the form...it will not accept our proper birthdays.",
        "I type the phone number the request pin button never enables and no error message is shown. Did anybody test this?",
        "The app does not let me put the right burth year for my children. It keeps the year at 2001 when I try ti change it. It won't apply the changes.",
        "It took over 5 minutes to send a pin, I requested another and never was sent. Typical we anything associated with the government.",
        "Great app. Good to have results available anytime in case needed.",
        "I can no longer assess symptoms or use this to show that a test isn't needed, the screen is gone.",
        "easy to use and get your covid results faster than your doctor even calling you. I was notified at evening and then on a weekend so I didn't have to wait until the next day or in the case of the weekend, Monday, to get my, thank the Goddess, negative results. it also has the history of your test results.",
        "I stopped registering after the app required me to enter my device password. Not cool. I saw another comment say the same thing and the app denied it saying it was requesting the pin. I already entered the pin at this point and it will not let me continue unless I give my device password. Update after developer response: I already entered the texted pin when it explicitly asked for my device password",
        "Downloaded the app. Followed the instructions. Until they asked for the phone unlock code. I wouldn't have been using phone if it was locked. ? The folks providing the vaccine said they would email me as I had instructed. They did. So why are you texting me to install your app? I'm now going to uninstall now. And don't expect to hear from you again.",
        "It worked, I was able to sign up easily and was able to access my test results",
        "I have been trying to see my results and unistall twice and is not letting me see my results. This app is giving me a hard time",
        "Just downloaded it. Keeps asking to verify a code. I get the code, punch it in and nothing. I try again and nothing. I think they sent it 5 times and still I can't hit next. Already Uninstalled it.",
        "The app is very easy to use and provides quick reliable medical results.",
        "All I want to to get my results not interested in any game or anything else at this time and I am not able to see my results all I see is games to buy not interested again.",
        "Quickly installed and it works perfectly. Saw my results from the tests I've taken, type of test, and date taken. Thank you for this app.",
        "I'm receiving text to my PR area code number, but I can NOT proceed in the app, because is not accepting my #.",
        "This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.",
        "I can't get the right pin.The pin number is either to long,or too short.sucks!",
        "Relieved when read plenty of good information. The Art used makes it attractive to look for more, the selection of words to explain information is lovely, fantastic, understandable. Congratulations. Thanks.",
        "Excellent experience. Highly recommended for Home bound patients",
        "Very difficult and frustrating to place Pin # in order to get test results. It took several attempts to finally get my negative results.",
        "Can not get past the basic enter your phone number screen to continue. There's no regular website to check just the app and it doesn't work.",
        "the people at Brian Picolo Park were excellent. they were kind, diligent and efficient \ud83d\ude0e",
        "When I got my covid-19 test result, I was in the hospital. I'm not positive they ever got the report. Part of the excuses offered was that their computers weren't talking to each other. It was much more involved but I appreciate your app communication with me.",
        "the Health care workers were in the community the test were done it was an easy process and the results were send to my phone and it were free. I were very grateful for the test.",
        "free app, doesn't require a lot of space, gives the info needed, and seems to never crash.",
        "I have great services and information about my procedures, this is very much better than waiting on hold, this app I'm sure is better for the staff as well. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00"
