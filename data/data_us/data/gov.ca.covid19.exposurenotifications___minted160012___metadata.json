    "description": "CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.\r\nCA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State\u2019s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.\r\nOnce you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users\u2019 privacy, these keys are only kept on the user\u2019s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.\r\nIf a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.\r\nYou must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.\r\nHow CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:\r\nCDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.\r\nThank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.",

        "I understand this is based on people voluntarily adding covid +ve result so that others get alert. But having this on my phone for months now, I am always skeptical whether it is even doing anything other than consuming phone resources and probably tracking my location. I read all the other reviews below about actual covid +ve people unable to actually add the positive test and the app's failure to send notification to others. I am convinced this is useless app. Uninstalling now.",
        "Simple, easy, negligible effect on battery, and unobtrusive. That's great. The biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't indicate that it's even working in any way. I'd suggest that it at least note the number of other devices that it encountered on a daily basis, so a user would 1. be able to gauge how many actual potential exposures they've had and 2. see that the app is actually doing something. e.g. 'You saw 7 other phones today with the CA Notify app...no exposures reported.\"",
        "Nice concept but im not convinced its effective enough to justify battery drain and storage space- uninstalling and taking my chances.",
        "The app doesn't work. I recently had a high risk exposure & self quarenteened.-thankfully testing neg during this time. The affected ind attempted to update their results in app numerous times. But couldn' get a code at all! They ended up calling people 2 notify them of their exposure. The app creates a false sense of security. People assume their environment is safe since they haven't seen an alert. This creates opportunity for careless mistakes and covid spread. Disappointed so far.",
        "Good concept but poorly executed. This app goes by voluntary indication by people if they are positive. If people are not aware of the app, are lazy, do not want to have extra apps installed, or dont care, then the app will not know who's infected or not. It would be better if they tied people's medical info & made it a required install to get a more accurate reading of an area. However privacy advocates wouldn't want that & cell companies wont enforce this install.",
        "NEED manual location update button OR ability to temporarily change time between checkins for this to be effective and reduce false sense of security. DOES NOT check frequently enough. Users may go many places in between app updating our location, therefore MISSING DATA for all those locations and people. We NEED an update so app can know ALL places we have been. Otherwise WE MAY NEVER KNOW we were exposed to Covid by someone using the app because the app didn't realize we were near them! What good is this app if it only recognizes very few places someone with Covid has been instead of all of them? NOT HELPFUL!!",
        "Please remember that for this app to work everyone who tested positive has to participate. They can't just add peoples information if they don't agree to it. People need to give permission. So if they don't show up it's bc they aren't doing their job to warn people and the community. What else can you expect from an individualistic western culture.",
        "The app is a great idea, however, no one uses it. I spent a couple weeks in a covid unit and I normally work on an ambulance and have never had an exposure alert.",
        "If you're infected, getting a code is next to impossible. I got through to get a code 3 days after my positive test. I'm an ER nurse. I keep my phone in my pocket at work. After 2 months & having contact with over a couple of hundred confirmed positive patients, I have never gotten a notification. My husband was notified of a potential exposure 2 days after I entered the notify code. The phones charge next to each other on the counter regularly. The app gives you a false sense of security.",
        "This app is like facemasks, only works when you use it. Once the stupids die off we should be ok. I have not received any exposure notifications but then again I try to not to go out and when I do I wear a respirator. Overkill, yes, but I enjoy breathing.",
        "Does this app work? It does not seem to be doing anything after having used it for over a month. It does not show any feedback or confirmation if it is effective or even working. Another problem is the California government has never aggressively promoted this app, which needs widespread adoption to be effective. Without any apparent benefit, what this app only does is constantly consuming power and tracking my every movement, which is why I am uninstalling it after writing this review.",
        "I thought this was a good idea for safety but it doesn't seem to work cuz after the fact I was normally exposed and it did not work I was not notified my Bluetooth was on",
        "It wold be great to have an optionfor people to report when they get 1st and 2nd vaccination mapped by location. It would be wonderful positive reinforcement and an aid to the most vulnerable.",
        "We have several cases of Covid around the corner and the app does not show them. Very disappointed! I hoped this app would help keep my family safe. The app is working. They must have fixed the bugs!",
        "I tried to report my positive test result but couldn't get a code from them because they didn't have the record in their system. Not the fastest method for reporting something that spreads much faster",
        "Bad battery drain. Without the app installed I finish my day at 9pm around 30% battery on S21. With the app installed my phone is at 30% by 3pm. Similar use both days.",
        "I just let this app run it hasn't gone off yet so I guess that's a good thing. I hope more people install it so they have more data to work with and identify clusters and superspreader events with higher resolution.",
        "Useless app. Several of my wife's co-workers and patients have tested positive for covid-19 and they have reported it to the app but my wife has not gotten any alerts or shown any exposures on the app.",
        "Used it for a month, not a single notification. Just a battery drainer. I think it is just a way for Google and Apple to monitor people. If you read the comments, you will be hard-pressed to find a single person that actually received a notification.",
        "Download this app to be notified for possible exposure to Covid. You have to keep Blutooth on at all times for this app to work properly. Not battery intensive though.",
        "The underlying message is insuring individual privacy... I'm glad there is a way to get the word out via media tool kit.. nice....",
        "Two households for which I brought over groceries and other necessities have multiple people who have tested positive in their house and who I was within 10' of since they tested positive. I have yet to receive a notification of exposure over 30 days since exposure.",
        "My roommate had covid and this app showed no exposure. I was around him the whole time, fortunately I didn't get it. I've been around others who were positive and the app still said no exposure. It's useless. Uninstalling.",
        "If you dont have a data plan for wifi while not at home i dont think this works and there is no contact us or email to ask anyone . false sense of security and not protecting you or anyone else if you dont have data/roaming wifi.",
        "Does it even work? At the very least tell us how many devices did u check per day, if others are not using this service, it's just using my battery for nothing",
        "App is good, easy to use App should have option to enter Covid vaccination info, then could track vaccine versus exposure,",
        "I tested positive and apparently I got it somewhere. I am trying to add to the app Im a positive and I cant. This is super inaccurate!!",
        "How does this work? I read online but I don't get how it can tell if you have covid or not. Does it take the positive people's identities and connect it with the phone or do people with covid have to manually put in that they tested positive? If they have to manually put it in, it's unlikely that they will. I give it 2 stars for the effort but I don't understand how its suppose to tell who has covid or not.",
        "CA Notify used to appear on my phone, but I can't see it anymore. I tried to download it again, and my computer says that CA Notify is installed on my phone. Why can't I see it there?",
        "Doesn't work my friends tested Positive never got notified. They also have the app and put in that they had tested positive.",
        "Edit: I was told by someone I work with that they tested positive, however this app is not showing that info. That's concerning. I'm hoping more and more people download this app. I live in a small community so I'm not sure if I'm ever going to get a notification stating someone tested positive because I don't think many people know about this app. But there are a lot of positives reported to the news by our County Public Health Dept.",
        "App doesn't do much. I think it works off blue tooth and if the other person has their Bluetooth on. I know for certain I've been danger close to numerous people that tested positive with covid-19, but app doesn't recognize that. I assume they need to report it to the app as well . It's a good idea, but requires too many variables to line up.",
        "Seems simple enough to use. Turn it on and leave it on. If you receive a notification from app it means you've had a prolonged exposure to someone who reports a positive test. The app doesn't have any means of indicating whether you have the vaccine or not. I think in order to help determine if the vaccine also helps prevent the spread of the virus we should consider adding this data element. Or something to the desired effect.",
        "Do not work on my phone. Always \"Something went wrong\"",
        "I think its great concept but truthfully I haven't had time to use the app. but if it does what it says, it's a 5 star app, and if it saves just 1 life. well how many stars can you put on a humen life. More then the stars in the sky.",
        "Intuitive and easy but I don't think enough users to be effective. I'm an ER doc in CA and have had on my phone with bluetooth on fo weeks and haven't gotten a single alert despite knowing for certain that I've been exposed. A lot.",
        "Unable to turn on notification. Got error message \"Something went wrong. Try again.\" Update: I uninstalled, re-downloaded, re-installed a couple of times. Still unable to turn on notification. More update: I am pretty good with computers and phones, yet I still cannot activate. No wonder this pandemic is out of control. Now I question the accuracy of the information even for those who succeeded in activating the software. Uninstalled. Cannot download again. I am blocked!!!",
        "There has not been any impact. I cannot tell its working. I do not like that you have to have location on all the time. Kills the batt. It sais you dont need location in. Phones have a tracker inside for 911 for your location however there are too much privacy concerns being able to track you all the time. China does and a commy country. I would not be surprised if it does come with the biden admin since that side wants to hold you down.",
        "It only makes sense that in order to notify you and others that you have been exposed to C-19, GPS had to be on, I'm not sure if just Bluetooth along has the same reach... But, so what? if our phone batteries need charging more frequently than before...we are using the app to help stop this virus asap, we need to cooperate and sacrifice a little, minimize the complaining, feedback is better, continue using the rest of the prevention measures, remain healthy...",
        "This is a great start that was slow in coming. We need everyone to be using it. The user key ID is great for keeping privacy. The only draybacks are the extra power being used by the Bluetooth, that I normally would have had off. I will use this app for me, and for the others that I come in close contact with. If everyone would load and use this app the contact tracing of exposure would be faster to let people know they were possibly exposed and to start quarantining faster and to get tested"
