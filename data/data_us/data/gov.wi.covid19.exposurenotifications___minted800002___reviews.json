However, it never proved personally useful, as I was proactive immediately upon learning that the virus had been identified as a highly-contagious coronavirus. I avoided high-risk environments at the onset of reports of the whistleblower doctor, who was disciplined for sounding the public health alert. Nonetheless, the app appeared to function as intended, even though I was likely never exposed to a self-reporting Covid-positive person, also using the app.",

I'm not a front-line worker but I regularly travel all over Wisconsin supporting essential functions including medical research and the production of foods and hand sanitizer. I take this and other precautions not out of fear for my own health or that of my immediate family, but to try to protect the greater community. Please join me.",
