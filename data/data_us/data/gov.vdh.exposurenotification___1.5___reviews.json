However when I turned off my phone's location, I received a notification from Google's Exposure Notifications framework that I needed to enable location in order for the app to work. What??? Covidwise says that \"No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app.\" I've since learned that while the app itself doesn't ask for location, Google's Exposure Notification framework (used by the app) obtains location data by using Bluetooth. This is very confusing. Please work out the kinks in messaging this. Otherwise it looks like the app is trying to do something sneaky (trying to gather and store my location data without telling me).",

        "content": "Kudos to VDH for doing such a good job with this app. The app is lightweight and unobtrusive, and it was designed with privacy in mind. The app is easy to use; you just go through a short setup, and then it runs quietly in the background. Hopefully that's the last you will ever hear of it. If you test positive, you can open up the app and report the test. If another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test, you will get a notification, and then you know you need to go get tested. That's all there is to it. I see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires GPS, but I'm not sure where they are getting that, since it is patently not true. You can see that much by just checking the app's requested permissions from Android's settings menu. It does, however, require Bluetooth to be turned on, since that's how it detects the presence of other devices. TLDR: this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created, let alone kept. If everyone uses it, then people who are exposed can self-isolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on, and that's a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. Use it, and you might just save a life, maybe even your own. When was the last time you did that by installing an app?",
