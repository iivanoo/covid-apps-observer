        "A daily check-in to display my status. I care about my own health and that of others. I need to see how many people are affected by Covid-19 in my state, county, city. I highly recommend this app. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
        "Works as described. It does not require GPS location like some people say nor does it have permission to access local data. 100% anonymous. I wish more people used the app and the ones who have it check in. At the time of me writing this, about 5% of the people who downloaded the app actually check in, so kinda defeats the purpose but that's not the app or developers fault. I'd like it to see a reminder to check in every day if possible for future updates.",
        "I like to help. Thinking I read directions correctly, now it is clear. . . \"Use this app for 1 minute a day to make an important contribution to the fight against coronavirus.\" I don't know about all that, but the simple and straight forward dashboard is slick. Do your part and pray we get through this post-haste! I find it alarming that Kent County, DE is surrounded by higher infection rates, to the north and south. Software that does not suck is Cool.",
        "Useless. Have had positive results for 2 days and still dont have the code to put into the app to alert others. Total waste of an app.",
        "I think this is a good idea maybe it will help figure out areas that need more help to battle this mess. Stay safe all!",
        "It works fine but, we NEED A DAILY REMINDER TO CHECK IN!",
        "New. Just installed. However, this important app was very easy to follow and activate. Best of all..ITS FREE! We need this sorta information to help combat Covid. Stay Safe all.",
        "Simple interface, good execution. Should be simple enough for less-than-tech-savy people. Very good idea making it Bluetooth only; I can recommend this to others with peace of mind in terms of privacy. It doesn't even ask for other permissions! All around great job. If you have criticisms, please send it to there feedback department. Don't just rate the app low because you're having trouble with it. You're just hurting the reach of the app, and we need this to be widespread to work.",
        "Health education is key. As a retired healthcare provider science must prevail.",
        "Whats the use of downloading a dumb app for covid. Im not a robot that a phone thinks i have covid. I rather go to the hospital now and have a check up for me instead of downloading this app. This app can be dangerous and idk know if you guys are trying to look through my phone and seeing what i am talking about to my bf. I thought the government already have our information for a long. But Nooooo, they want to use this to be deep in our asses. I dont trust this app. Bye!",
        "This is a great app but the problem is that more residents of delaware need to download the app. Also most of the time only 1000 people check in. I removed it, until more people sign up and report every day.",
        "I'm from Maryland but travel to Delaware frequently. This app only works on one of my phone, the others are too old. Please expand the API to include phones down to 4.4. Also less than 100 installs (50+) indicates no one is using it at the time of review. This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less. For this type of app to be meaningful, you need to have engagement > 50% of the population or >500,000% more installs.",
        "Would like to use the app, but the app always hangs when I get to the data page and click on Continue. I' using a Pixel 3 phone, Android 11.",
        "Wish it would remind me to enter daily data. And with 35,000 users and only 180 check-ins a day I assume that feature would help others too.",
        "The app needs to be updated as it still talks about 14 days of isilatio. I'm not sure what phase 2 is as we are now at alert level 1",
        "Very informative and hey if it keeps me safer I'm all for it .",
        "My only suggestion is adding daily reminder notifications to check in.",
        "Idk what i didnt do right but this app would not work for me to save my life an i was against downloading it in the first place but i did an it bit me i guess it wouldnt scyne an give my call in i.d to talk to the rep.",

        "Wow makes you turn on bluetooth and is a complete invasion of privacy. Stay home and hide if you are scared of COVID",
        "I don't think I have the virus, but I think it's allergy. I do have the symptoms mentioned but have had them for along time (not14days). Question what are the symptoms for animals(cats&dogs) I can not stop them from itching, coughing, feeling slightly bad",
