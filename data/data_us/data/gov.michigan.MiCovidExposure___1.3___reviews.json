It would be great if the map showed the amount of cases by city instead of county, more recent info, and the map on a different section of the app because I thought for a minute that there was no map, there is its just not super informative. I'd also like to see a leaderboard of what city's have the most cases and have testing areas on the map. Otherwise it's a good start in the right direction for michigan :)",

It doesn't appear to use much battery, even though it hopefully is working all the time. Otherwise it would be pointless. My only problem is the stats displayed don't match the most recent data on the website. That seems simple enough for the developers to get working right.",

While I did not give it 5 stars (due to just getting the app) I did want to comment and let you know that I appreaciate it.",
