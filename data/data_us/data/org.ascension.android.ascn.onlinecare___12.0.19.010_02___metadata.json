        "All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???",
        "I love using this app the doctors are very knowledgeable and it's quick and easy. With everything that's going on in the world today it makes staying home and staying safe easy.",
        "Easy and simple to use and has excellent video and audio quality! I had a visit with my son's doctor and it's so much better than needing to go in to the office!",
        "Even without covid19 causing all these remote visits I love it and wish this will continue in the future. So easy!",
        "Always have trouble logging in I am very discouraged and the support number given is not the correct one",
        "Had a virtual appointment today that I couldn't attend because the app keeps closing on me!!!!",
        "Completely useless app, freezes every time I open it. No menu pops up after the login screen. Android user.",
        "Edit: Used a second time and still am impressed! The Dr was very informative and very nice! He helped me with all my questions and I would totally use again.",
        "I haven't used this app yet, because I just have open the app when I was in Lourdes Memorial Hospital as a patient there.",

        "This experience was good over all. Dr. Joe listen to the symptoms & prescribed me the meds I needed. Thank You!",
        "Very convenient! I was waiting on Covid results and did not want to put others at risk. This app helped me to stay quarantined and still make my appointment!",
        "Very easy to use and very convenient.",
        "Answering the same questions week after week is annoying. Covid questions for Virtual Visits?? Seriously??!! People have a .02% of catching it and an even lesser % of it being deadly. Do you really think it's gonna transfer thru a phone? js",
        "Great app fast reliable and convenient",
        "Went to use today for my appointment and all it does is force closes. Was a great app but now its f****d.",
        "Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.",
        "Great Experience ! So wished I had the doctor as my primary! Thank you",
        "This app has been a life saver for me. Literally. I'm high risk during this pandemic. Thank God for alternative online options for doctors visits during these uncertain times.",
        "Suck Fest. Worst customer service ever. Save your $.",
        "Quality application provides what I need for virtual appointments",
        "Was nice to not get out just to answer a few questions.",
        "App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.",
        "My visit with Tony Barbettini was awesome as always. He always listens to what I have to say and recommends the proper action to take.",
        "This app was easy to enroll and use!!!",
        "This provided an efficient, helpful way to manage a simple healthcare need! Thanks!",
        "Such a safe experience to get a simple treatment for non emergency issue. Thank you",

        "Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment",
        "Awesome mush better than going in due to COVID-19. Much safer..",
        "I have only had one visit, but this was a good experience. I must add that part of that comes from the fact that I have an excellent doctor. Dr. Stephen Goedderz",
        "My doctor couldnt get thru and my tablet wasnt compable",
        "Poor App, can't send a message to my doctor."
