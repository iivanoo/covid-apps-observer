        "I did not have a very good experience, I barely got out what was wrong before he told me I probably have pneumonia, which I do not. Was on the call less than 3 minutes, it literally was a waste of time.",
        "Was caring and listened to what I had to say. Was professional and gave precise instructions and information about what she was doing for me and what I needed to do as well.",
        "2nd time using the online doctor visit. Both good experiences. Better than going into a possible covid infested waiting room. I used my phone and had no issues with the connection at all. This will always be my 1st choice if it's something that can be diagnosed over video chat. I was only billed $59 so no complaints about that at all. Wait time was less than 10 minutes.",
        "With two kids, this is the best app on my tablet. I have used it while traveling, after hours, and holiday. My kids seem to suddenly need medical attention at the most inopportune times. This app has saved me 4 trips to ER/Urgent care in less than 2 years.",
        "This app is very easy to use. There were lots of provider options and the entire process took less time than checking in at urgent care.",
        "I was able to set up my account and talk to the doctor in less than 15 minutes (this includes the time that I spent on the phone with the doctor). I would highly recommend!!!",
        "Don't understand why BCBSofM couldn't verify my insurance. I pay way to high a premium for that. That's very iritating. However, other than that this was a positive experience.",
        "Good visit with nurse had to do over phone due to video actually not working but will not do again.Have to see in person doctor Even though just a normal script refill something that is well documented and nothing major.",
        "Love this. Saves time and money. Every experience has been exceptional.",
        "So much better than going to urgent Care or the ER. Especially right now with all this COVID19 craziness.",
        "Really horrible service 100% of time - multiple attempts. I wanted this service to be successful, its not. Disappointing.",
        "Doctor Good, App Mediocre. Doctor Boehr was quick to evaluate and get me the help I needed. The BCBSM online app, however, failed to connect to my BCBSM insurance information. It also failed five times to verify and accept any credit card information.",
        "Worked very well. Be sure to have any PCP information and any of your meical history, allergies & list of medications to speed things up.",
        "My Doctor was very helpful and understanding. This is a new way to have ailments addressed more immediately.",
        "Overall good experiences, perosnel were very educated. The video quality was a little spotty but did not dissrupt my visit.",
        "Was fast and easy. Safe way to stay away from covid.",
        "Overall great! Addressed my issues with care & understanding.",
        "I used it for online doctor consult. Took me 10 minutes and cost $10 !",
        "Excellent experience, the doctor was very professional and friendly",
        "Very easy to use, right from home...thanks",
        "The experience was great. Quick and easy.",
        "Easy and convenient",
        "They charged me for the visit I had for my daughter, even though they told me there was nothing they could do about her uti and said to take her to urgent care. Um, hello, covid. Why tf do you think I did a virtual visit?!?!",
        "What a FANTASTIC experience! You can choose from several doctors, and you can see how they look and their experience. The only thing missing, obviously, is a physical exam, but how nice to be treated and not have to leave home!",
        "So this was incredibly easy to set up. Was able to create an account, list all my symptoms and see a doctor within about 45 minutes. That's just awesome. Thank you very much for making the entire process incredibly seamless.",
        "Very Professional and helpful",
        "Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting. You'll have to re-log back in again although the info. you previously entered will still be there to copy over.",
        "I used it for the first time tonight, so glad I found it. Simple sinus infection which I'm prone to. Was able to get script for antibiotics without having to go to urgent care. More importantly...my visit cost $10 instead of $75. :) My only issue is the pharmacy locator map is off, so I had to hunt my pharmacy down. It showed my pharmacy being a mile south of where it actually is, with other pharmacies around it, that aren't there either. :(",
        "I am impressed with this app. First of all, it is very easy to use. They have made it so comprehensive that a child could walk through it. Second, the wait time is way shorter than going to the doctor's office, urgent care, and ESPECIALLY the emergency room. I've used this app twice so far and my longest wait time has been 2 minutes! Last but not least, the doctor who I saw on both occasions has been very professional and courteous. She listened to my concerns and helped me as needed. I'm happy",
        "Corona makes for a long waiting room. Also app doesn't work well in the back ground. Gotta sit in waiting room with no phone,or take the chance on loosing a place on the waiting list. I think it would be a better experience if it worked in the back ground and had some kind of sound to wake you if you fall asleep in waiting room. I did it 3 times.\ud83e\udd2b",
        "I had to register since this was my first time using online services. That was easy. There were 2 patients ahead of me. I did not try to do other things on my phone while in the waiting room. I waited 20 minutes, saw the doctor, and was done. Fast, easy, waited what I felt was a very reasonable period of time, considering it's not a set appointment and I imagine many are taking advantage of this service now with the shelter in place order in effect. I will use this again.",
        "Excellent - an easy to navigate app, first-time user with no issues setting up appt./insurance/pharmacy info and getting right in to the 'waiting room' for a pediatrician. The doctor was friendly and asked everything I'd have expected to make a diagnosis by screens. This will be fabulous for those URI/flu visits, to get through that, \"let it run its course\" stage of illness that I'd know would be coming even if I went in to a brick/mortar for vitals.",
        "It was much easier than I thought I would be. I was able to select from several doctors and see their ratings. The app allows for you to cancel before the doctor comes on which is great. Glad I didnt cancel because the doctor was also able to send prescription in to my pharmacy too.",
        "Love this application, didn't even have to leave my couch :-) it was quick and easy to use and was much better than being sick and going to the doctor's office or Urgent Care. The whole experience took about 10 to 15 minutes and my scripts will be ready in an hour. I think this is awesome!",
        "A waste of my time and money. I was charged $49 for them to tell me to take my teen to an urgent care. No disclaimers about what they would or would not treat for a kid. If my child was over 18 they could have been treated, but since they were only 16 they had to charge me to tell me go to a doctor. Waste of time and money. I will update the rating if I get a refund.",
        "The wait was normal for it saying 7 people ahead of me it didn't take hours it was more like an hour so I would say the app worked perfect the Dr. Was great! And he prescribed. Medicine for my problem and it was over . After that he gave me some follow directions and what to do if it got worse and to check up with my PCP no matter what, and if the medicine didnt help to check on it being maybe an abscyst or something else he was emailing me everything we talked about etc. So no complaints!!",
        "Fast, easy, and thorough. Being able to have live video discussion with a Doctor in a private room in a clinic was reassuring. Having a list of available providers to choose from is nice. Having my puppy chewing on my arm because I was on my laptop was not ideal, however, lol. Doc got a good laugh from it.",
        "Do not waste your time with this service. I called yesterday in extreme pain knowing something was wrong, the provider brushed me off and said it was likely viral. I did not trust this diagnoses so asked customer service for a second visit for free and this request was not completed. I felt worse today and went to a care provider where I tested positive for STREP THROAT! I told these people I was in pain and they did not care or investigate further. SHAME ON THEM! DO NOT USE.",
        "Took a while to connect with the doctor. The appointment was really rushed and I was prescribed a medicine that didn't make sense. I called customer support to try to get info on why I was prescribed the certain medicine and was told I had to \"take it or leave it or call a different doctor\". Tried calling a different physician and the physician declined my call. I would rather go to ready care.",
        "I love the online app option to talk to a doctor. This was my first time using it and I'm completely satisfied. We are in the middle of the COVID pandemic and its Saturday morning. The last thing I want to do is rush to urgent care if not 100% necessary (we would have waited for our family doc on Monday if this option was not available)."
