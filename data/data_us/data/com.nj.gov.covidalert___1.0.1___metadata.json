        "I think the app is great. Very informative. It's all in one spot. You do not have to have bluetooth on all the time. You can switch it on when you would like to use it then switch it back off. Without bluetooth you are still able to access and use all of the other features like covids daily numbers local/global/etc and also you are able to check in with how you are feeling and report symptoms..just another tool in the fight against covid.",
        "Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.",
        "Not very useful.: 1. You must have and utilize a smart phone 2. You must have it activated 3. You must report your status daily 4. You must be in close contact with an infected person for too long and they must have reported they have symptons 5. Will it be compatable with apps from other states",
        "Work in an emergency room and downloaded to see how accurate the alerts would be. I assumed I would have to turn off the notification from being alerted to much. To my surprise I haven't been alerted once in over a month of having the app even after being in direct patient care with positive cases.",
        "I am not leaving my Bluetooth on everywhere I go which isn't far but this will take a long time to get enough peoples info and get them on board before you can do that! Ifmt feels intrusive as well. Never leave your Bluetooth on unless you know what your hooked up to.",
        "During setup I realized that it requires both GPS and Bluetooth to be engaged. If I do this with my phone, it would die in 4 hours. I'm an emergency service personnel, I can't go with a dead phone all day. Sorry. Good idea but won't work for me.",
        "Installed with zero issues on an Pixel 4a running Android 11. After setting up the app, my COVID-19 Exposure Notification API (in the Google settings) updated to finally change to On. This means this application is ACTUALLY using the Google and Apple official API package. So excited to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.",
        "Cannot even finish setup poor development. Simple alert app should not be inconvenient to use if it is most people won't go through the headache of setting it up. This fix should be top priority. Poor development something like this should be more easily usable.",
        "I understand needing location for the alerts but why would it need bluetooth? Modern day dependence on wireless devices destroys battery life as it is. I keep my Bluetooth, location and few other settings off unless I need to use them. Again, I understand location, but why bluetooth. *Anyone that doesn't know keep bluetooth wifi and nfc off unless you need it to keep yourself safe from hackers.",
        "Editing my review. The setup will fail if wifi is enabled and you will likely get the error 1006 as I did and noted in my original review. Turn off wifi per other reviewers suggestions and you should be fine. Giving 3 stars due to the poor qa and setup experience.",
        "Edit - works perfectly after turning off wifi during setup. Got an immediate response from the developer on the workaround. Does not work. Error code 1002. This error is displayed after I confirm my age and press continue. I have a OnePlus 6t phone (android)",
        "I had no problems installing on Galaxy Note 20. I think the app is a great idea. I just wish the general public would embrace it instead of fearing it. Some view it as a threat to privacy and simply don't understand how it actually works. A bigger PR campaign is needed I think.",
        "Still don't understand when to use covid Check-in button. Is it used when you have been diagnosed with covid, or do you just use it to let the system know you feel well regardless of whether you think you may have covid? I'm afraid of pressing the button because I feel like it will think I have Covid. Please explain in plain English what makes the app label you as covid positive.",
        "UPDATE: Working now per comment from developer. I can't get the app to work on my Galaxy S10. It installs, I affirm I'm over 18, and on the data sharing page I get an error code 1002 and can't move on. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and get the same problem. I do not have this problem on the VA COVID app I also have on my phone.",
        "NOTE: Based on previous reviewers, I turned off wifi before trying to download. I had no issues at all during the quick download process; the app walked me thru setup (with brief explanations, but I'd already read about how it works). So fat, I'm pleased. Now let's so how it performs...",
        "The app itself seems fine. Have battery usage concerns after a few hours of having it installed though. I'll give it a day or two, but will uninstall if I see too much of an impact. Not worth the trade off!",
        "Graphs of the data are basically useless without the ability to filter on the last 30 days. The data from March-April dominates the plotted ranges which makes it difficult to determine the actual covid cases and deaths that are occurring now.",
        "In order to install app I was to turn off my wifi during install and my malware scanner. After doing this I turned on my wifi no problem, but my malware scanner detected the NJ COVID ALERT as malware due to I guess the access to Bluetooth. I will try it for a week and decide weather to keep it",
        "I'm not sure I understand how it works re. sharing the positive result so other people can be alerted. I read the app info /learn how it works several times so I must be missing something. Is the assumption that the person go anywhere to take a C19 test and wait for a representative to call them? If so, how would the representative know that you tested positive?",
        "Easy fast to download . I like it I think it's great app to have on my phone because it helps me to feel just a little more safe going outside the only thing is my battery power is not lasting as long for some reason. Who knows? It is worth it to me I'll just charge up more often",
        "Even though I have exposure alerts on it seems to only do a scan if I open the app itself. Shouldn't it do this automatically daily?",
        "I used regular data plan and no WiFi to install app. Now the app is fully functional. Further report to follow after I use the app for a while.",
        "Can't get pass the 2nd screen during the setup process.error code 1002 (Your Data page) uninstalling until you get your act together and fix this.",
        "I get to the getting started screen and my phone freezes and then says app isn't responding. I've tried on WiFi, ice tried with WiFi off. Same result each time.",
        "Long overdue. In some countries that are managing the pandemic more effectively, apps like this had have been in place for months. Some are mandatory, and you can check in to a place or business. This is a step in the right direction!",
        "Numbers are not being updated \"Current COVID hospitalization\" has remained unchanged for weeks (459) I will uninstall app and consider reinstalling if issue is fixed.",
        "Works well. Turned off wifi when I installed. Check in daily. Love the privacy-conscious way this is implemented. Give me more granular information!",
        "I kept getting Error 1002 trying to enable Usage Statistics. Then I turned off Wifi and I was able to enable everything. I never experienced that type of bug before....Hmmmm. Why?",
        "Downloaded using my home WiFi.. Does not work. Error 1002 **Read reviews below that said Turn Off WiFi and download using cellphone data only. Works PERFECTLY NOW.",
        "App works perfectly for me. Im on a huawei p20 pro, running an older version of Android (9, I believe), with no issues.",
        "I work at a busy congenial store, and have had the app installed for a few months now. I find it really improbable no one infected with the app has walked into the store.",
        "Trying to open after downloaded on my son's Galaxy S6 android today and the app crashes.Won't open. UPDATE: I was finally able to download. It was my son's phone that needed updating",
        "Very easy to download. User friendly interface. Provides real-time information and Covid stats.",
        "This app collects daily data well enough, BUT IT GIVES LITTLE INFO THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE!! PLEASE IMPROVE IT!!! - County-level % is % of STATE!! USELESS!! WHAT'S IMPORTANT is the current 7 day positivity testing rate!!! - NOT BY COUNTY, BUT BY MY CURRENT LOCATION!!! - EVEN BETTER: GIVE THE % POSITIVITY WITHIN A 1,5,10,25 MIKE RADIUS!!! THIS WAY, PEOPLE CAN MANAGE RISK!!! - YOU HAVE THE GPS COORDINATES OF EVERYONE, SO YOU CAN DO THIS!!! WHY DON'T YOU????",
        "EDIT: Disabling Wi-Fi works, thank you! Original Review: Can't get past the setup screen, \"Error Code 1002\"",
        "Its not working. Saying \"error loading page\" for two days straight. I uninstalled & re installed, same message",
        "Slowest app in existence, love the daily check-ins and the the app in general but the horrendous slowness makes it a pain",
        "No problems installing. Great attention to personal privacy concerns & still able to trace contacts to prevent future infections. So glad we finally have this!!",
        "This application shouldn't just depend on Bluetooth to operate, it should use a Wi-Fi signal. I hate turning on my Bluetooth, don't think it's safe for my health.",
        "I keep getting error after I click continue. It says Sorry that didn't work properly (error code 1002)."
