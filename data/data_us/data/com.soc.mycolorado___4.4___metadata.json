        "Bizarre bug. The camera is not picking up much light. I know it's the app because my camera works in other apps. I was trying to set up my ID which requires a selfie for facial verification. I set up multiple photography lights and it was still way too dark in the app.",
        "To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.",
        "Tried retaking my picture a good 15 times and it kept saying it couldn't match my photo with my DMV photo. Tried uploading a photo instead but still no luck. I then tried to upload my picture from my ACTUAL license and it still didn't work. So frustrating.",
        "In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.",
        "Completely worthless so far...kinda like cotrip.... was finally able to create login after several failed attempts. Turned on finger print verification and all permissions, but just get stuck forever on \"authentication verified\" page.",
        "This app is no good because every time I try to make an appointment they would not let me make one they would say I had an error so here I see it with no ID and trying to get my ID for a year now and I still can't get it and and it's nothing but BS all they're trying to do is waste time I went down there and they had no one in the line no backup or nothing and I still couldn't get in to get my ID",
        "Will not scan drivers license code and does not give a way to enter this info manually. Tried with two different phones...same result.",
        "(UPDATE: They've fixed all of my previous issues and vastly improved the user interface. If only car dealers accepted the digital DL, then it'd be flawless.) Absolutely useless app. I tried scanning my ID on multiple phones, only to have nothing happen. Tried on my LG, Samsung, Iphone, and tablets with the same result accross all platforms.",
        "S21Ultra. App is unable to use appropriate camera, resulting in an inability to take a picture of my ID, rendering the app useless to me.",
        "Can't Register, worthless. Crashes every time I try and take the photo of my bar code...",
        "Damn camera will not scan the barcode on back of i.d. really frustrating if only I could use this it would save me alot of stress and help me alot at the moment",
        "2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. \ud83d\udc4dWhen this app is working, its amazing.",
        "Says the server is down when I attempt to create an account. Been doing this for a week and no change.",
        "Now that most of the bugs are worked out, it's great. they do need to do a better job of explaining that the picture it takes is for facial recognition to prove that you're the person on your ID and not that it's taking a new picture for the ID.",
        "The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.",
        "As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.",
        "Needs to be able to add antique vehicles. Can't seem to add vehicles with Horseless Carriage plates.",
        "I was notified about this App through the CPW fishing site, I can say as a disabled veteran I found this really easy to learn about.",
        "I think this is great. I love being able to switch out what info is visible on my ID. I just wish when I tried to use it, the other person didn't think I was tricking them.",
        "Great App! But, periodically wont let me log in.",
        "MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.",
        "The facial recognition won't recognize my face. I just took my new photo for my ID TODAY, I don't look any different. I literally took a picture of my face on my new ID and it STILL won't recognize me. This is useless if I can't use it. Why use facial recognition in the first place? Thumb print is good enough for anything else.",
        "This app is awesome! It's a must have for everyone who wants the convenience of having your CO State ID or Driver's License on your phone. There's no way you can lose it when it's at the touch of your fingertips!!",
        "I've tried all day to get my stuff and it will not take a pic of my face to verify. Very sad.",
        "I was so excited to download this app only to be shut out EVERY TIME I TRY TO SCAN MY ID! Please iron out the kinks and I will be sure to come back for a 5 star review.",
        "Whatever issues with the march update isn't affecting my use. Love it and super easy to use!!",
        "I'm sure it's a great site, but it does not let me create a site with my California DL.",
        "Turn off all accesses like location and storage they will use this to spy and gather data",
        "The app itself is good, I haven't the chance to use it yet but I like that I can share everything with one click if needed",
        "More security on this app to add my cpw licenses than forigen nationals require to enter the country or to buy a gun. Why can't I just log in with my cpw info and have my tags here?!? Just because you have a technology (ID scan, face recognition) doesn't mean it's merited.",
        "Login asks for password and sms code every time. Even with fingerprint.",
        "Kicks me off everytime i try to show my id. Plus most places wont accept this form of ID. Give us a card like other states. PLEASE!",
        "Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.",
        "What a wonderful way to access your ID in the Digital age. I applaud Gov. Polis for being instrumental in giving Coloradoans access to their content digitally.",
        "My license expired and I renewed on line, but had not received my new card. This app allowed me to have a picture ID accepted almost everywhere in Colorado, while I waited for my new license. Note that some places with age restricted products, as well as airport security, do not accept this digital ID so call before you go if it's your only option. Cool links to frequently used services are on the app. So far no technical hiccups and it has saved the day on many occasions. Highly recommend!",
        "Freezes every time i attempt to scan barcode. Tried both on and off wifi. Reinstalled multiple times. Ensured all permissions are allowed. Then when i try to chat for help, i get queued for 26 minutes until it closes on a Friday. I need help. If you're moving this direction, you still need humans to address concerns.",
        "The app is great and is very convenient specially sens you don't ever go anywhere with out our phones so you always have your id with you this way! I just wish you were able to use it at more places and able to use it to cash checks and wat not but besides those few things it's an amazing idea thanks alot",
        "Great idea. Very convenient. It was so incredibly easy to set up and no hassle from the merchant accepting the digital ID. They seemed relieved that I had digital ID.",
        "My coworker needed to call to verify himself and they were extremely responsive and respectful. I was shocked considering most state job workers are always swamped with tons of work. Great app and soooo convenient to have!",
        "Captures too much phone info. Spyware."
