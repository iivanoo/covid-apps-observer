        "Worked very well twice now for simple issues that didn't warrant COVID exposure in a doctor's office. Very efficient. Worth the cost of office visit for the convenience.",
        "It shows an empty physician rating and doesn't let you rate them. They did not give me any way to access lab results. Their registration for the separate lab system does not work. I should have gone to a real urgent care.",
        "Was fast and reasonably priced. They only charged me a regular office visit copay instead of an urgent room copay. Which is what I would have done instead. Easy to do and saved me a lot of time.",
        "Quick, professional and the face 2 face very helpful. No \"waiting room\" to sit in with other sick patients was definitely a benefit and offered additional comfort.",
        "Great exprience with the doc she addressed the issue answed all questions and was very helpful",
