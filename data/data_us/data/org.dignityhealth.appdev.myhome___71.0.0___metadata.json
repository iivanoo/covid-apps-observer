        "I've been online for 25 minutes just waiting to speak to someone at the Dignity Health office and I can't seem to find out how to just fill the forms out online. Don't have the capability of downloading them and bringing them in",
        "Worthless. Basically a glorified bookmark to their website. Save yourself the 87mb (and having to log in twice) by just bookmarking the website yourself. Website is worthless too, any information that is abby-normal says \"contact your doctor\".",
        "Won't let me sign in to patient portal says user and pass don't match",
        "I'm I just signed up and I can't log in to see my account it keeps sending me back to beginning does anybody have any advice it would be greatly appreciated thank you",
        "Not happy with app. Won't let me login, keep saying login fail due to username/pw/email in correct. I even reported the issue, got a response stating issue is fixed. which it was not a all, since I cant still login on the app. But I have no issues using the same login info on the web page for the site.",
        "Forget experience, you won't be able to login. After 1st login it would ask you to log in again when you select see Lab results, then it would say email address not found. I don't recommend this app at all.",
        "l yes getting the advertising when l' wast play my YouTube channel and l' download from my developer play Google store and l think is a great idea to manger us doctor appointments easy to set up and to be more available document report for each individual and l give my feedback of good services and inpro",
        "How many accounts do you need? I mean if you are going to send your patients to your app why have separate apps for each section. And why have an app that is just a restricted web browser.",
        "Horrible waste of time.cant even get in.....",
        "You have to log in online so why use this crumby app. So worthless.",
        "Not easy to use and to many questions to answer",
        "Worse apps can't log in",
        "This app is very informative and easy to use. I highly recommend it.",
        "It will not let mi log in",
        "Awesome"
