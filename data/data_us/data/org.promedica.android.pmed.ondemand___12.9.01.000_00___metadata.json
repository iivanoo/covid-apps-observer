        "Excellent. I don't like going to my doctor right now so I prefer using this as an option. Great doctors. I've only had one I found a bit rude but we all have those days. I didn't have a long wait and the doctors are thorough.",
        "Convenient. Easy to use",
        "Just had our first appointment for my daughter and it went so smoothly. I was nervous at first, but the doctor was patient, listened to our concerns and asked a lot of questions. This is a great app and I definitely will use again.",
        "Impressed with the ease and ability to speak with a compassionate, respectful, and intelligent medical provider and get treatment. I didn't realize how thorough this experience would be in such a short time frame. The wait for the provider to review my charts was necessary to understand my current overall health and current ailment as providing medical advice is a serious obligation.",
        "This service is very misleading as I consulted the website prior to paying $59 to be told that this service would not be able to help. The attached shows exactly how you advertise this service. I was unable to leave home or visit a doctors office for the condition my child needed treatment for which was advertised on the website. That was an easy $59 for the doctor and useless/expensive for me. I Would never recommend this service to anyway. False Advertising!!",
        "You can combine several hospitals together if they use Epic. Haven't figured out the best way to combine dissimilar systems into Mychart. Also trying to figure out the best app to use to import data like pulse, heart rate, pain levels, and exercising habits.",
        "This works great! The commute time to the office was short and I was able to sit in my own couch as I waited. I do have to update the magazines in my waiting room. \ud83d\ude01",
        "AWESOME time saver. So much better than going to the Doctor. I took care of everything I needed in McDonald's parking lot on my lunch! Waiting for scripts to be delivered.",
        "You have to enter in a bunch of information before being seen, but by the time you get to the end, the doctor is no longer available. The interface is great, but I can't actually get to a doctor. They are always no longer available by the time I get to the end.",
        "easy to use! provider was polite, professional, and very informative.",
        "Volume on trying hear provider was very quiet, but other than it was a great way to deal with a simple ear infection.",
        "glad this option was available for me to use since I was not able to get into my family physician. Dr. Cain was very nice and didn't rush through.",
        "First time using this app, and I love that I didn't have to leave the house. The physician was amazing, and it was very quick and efficient. Thanks",
        "Convenient, saved so much time, and my insurance was accepted.",
        "Friendly, listened carefully to concerns, courteous, quick.",
        "easy and convenient... especially when your sixky and dont want to leave house.",
        "amazing app. great knowledge and fast response time.",
        "Quick and easy for a simple diagnosis like pink eye.",
        "So far it has been awesome! I never knew that my insurance would cover this. My first online doctor experience!",
        "Its 620am and I didn't have to wait till my dr office opened!!! This ap is amazing and will be using it when I can not get into my pcp!!!",
        "Loved it...saved me a trip to doctors office when I knew it was sinus infection and just needed antibiotic",
        "Easy to use but some of the doctors are rude and dont listen to issues",
        "This so convient. I do not have to drive in cold or sit by other patients not feeling well. True Blessing.",
        "Great experience at 3 am with provider for a viral infection.",
        "What a wonderful app to use works great very easy to use.",
        "this was awesome and so incredibly convenient",
        "Very easy to use, I was impressed",
        "amazing, fast and easy",
        "Excellent and easy",
        "according to my insurance this should be free but they tried to bill me 59 dollars what the heck",
        "Super easy experience.",
        "Very pleasant and helpful",
        "It's Saturday Morning and I was able to get treated for Strep Throat.",
        "Dr. was very helpful.",
        "so convenient for someone who works later than doctor office hours 7",
        "This is the best way to see a doctor for cold and flu",
