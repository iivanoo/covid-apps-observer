    "comments": [
        "There are multiple issues with this app. 1. There needs to be a visual timestamp. Especially in chat. It's obvious as to why it's not there, but it would and should be displayed ethically. 2. There should be a way to set an audible notification, as I have no idea until I look again, whether or not my chat has been answered.",
        "It's great not having to leave the house to be seen by a primary care physican. Telehealth is also a good why to ask questions and discuss concerns about your health and get medication refills covered.",
        "Hello I had a wonderful appointment with the Doctor.She educated me about health. I had concerns about some medications she answered my questions. She took time out with me she was very patient and caring. Encouraged me to continue to be healthy to exercise and to keep in contact with my regular doctor. She let it be known that heal is there for me thank you so much. Very grateful Doretta Williams",
        "I love this app and I would highly recommend it. House calls are back and Heal knows how to do it right!",
        "Amazing experience! The doctor was very understanding and knowledgeable. This really is the future of medicine.",
        "The Heal app is great & easy to use plus communicate",
        "This app interrupted my usage of it to ask me to rate it, which as per policy is an automatic one star rating.",
        "Wellcare is great, this is another benefit in Pandemic",
        "Very easy to make an appointment, and the appointment was the next day. The doctor I saw was very kind, professional, and helpful.",
        "The HEAL team arrived within the designated time frame, were very personable and knowledgeable.",
        "Web shows 30.00 on site flu shots for the elderly, in this case my 89 year old mother.. Once you register its 79.00. Uninstalled app and will never use or recommend. Be honest and upfront.",
        "This app is excellent. Access to doctor on app is nice and useful.",
        "Very easy to use. Quick and fast service, one of the fastest I've seen in the industry.",
        "Great way to see a doctor, especially when you don't feel well.",
        "I can't sign on through Blue Shield. The app constantly crashes.",
        "Good experience and can make appts easy also.",
        "Best first patient experience ever. The doctor was amazing and helped me with everything I needed. I will definitely be choosing heal again.",
        "Best available housecalls option other than My Happy Doctor of course!",
        "Was easy and the doctor was really helpful!",
        "App is user friendly and I had a great experience with my doctor",
        "There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.",
        "I just used Heal for the first time today. The app worked seamlessly, just so easy to understand and quick. The doctor arrived with a nurse to give flu shots to my family and it was such a great experience, they were very professional and completely lovely. I will definitely use heal again, as a mom of 2 its hard to find time for myself so I'm already planning to use it again for my annual physical. You can't beat a service that comes to you at the touch of a button, with professional staff, no parking stresses and no finding appointments around school hours. Also having a husband that never finds time around work hours to see a doctor, for him especially, this couldn't work out better.",
        "Atrocious communication. Completely mismanaged. I really wanted to like them but their service was disastrous. I requested an annual physical and some standard blood testing. 4 weeks, 3 visits, 7 vials of blood, and they kept losing samples, calling for the wrong tests, and giving me a different story for the state of things with every phone call. After all of this, and having one of their top doctors jump in, only 2/5 tests were conducted conclusively. Just go to a real doctor. AVOID HEAL.",
        "Horrible Support Staff response time, poor house call system in app. The doctor I got was great, the app wasnt. Telemedicine call went quick and painless but when we tried to get a house call setup the appointment was cancelled day of. There was no email or indication as to why and I followed up with Heal through their chat and emailed them. The chat support told me they'd reschedule the appointment and never got back to me. The email got a response 14 hours later for followup emails.",
        "Incredibly unreliable and will never use the app again. I booked the first avail appt for a Dr to come in the afternoon. I got a call an hour before the appt to tell me that the system shouldn't have let me book it and that no doctor was coming. My daughter is very sick and now we can't get another Dr appt til tomorrow. This is people's health, not a pizza delivery. You've got to be more on top of your bookings. If you look at other reviews this seems to be more common than it should be.",
        "Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the \"schedule a service\" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?",
        "My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.",
        "This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...",
        "This was absolutely amazing! I really can't even hardly believe how simple it was! I booked my appointment in a fevered daze. Hours later a doctor & nurse are at my couch side taking my vitals and doing everything needed. They can even do bloodwork on the spot! I'm seriously super thrilled about this. Next, I'll just have my new prescriptions delivered thru CVS delivery. Such wonderful options for personal ease & keeping germs contained! + Takes Medicare & many insurances simply & effectively!",
        "Never of Heal: an Dr. visits in the home",
        "Awesome service. Baby got sick? Just call a heal doctor to your home instead of waiting in the ER. The app works easy and is straight forward to use. After adding a new patient the scheduling of an appointment takes only a couple of clicks.",
        "Game changer for us. As parents of a newborn the convenience and quality cannot be overstated. We love the doctor, the staff handling logistics are on top of their game, and instead of lugging a baby to a germy doctors office we wait and are seen in our own home. Plus they take our insurance!",
        "My experience with the app was very smooth, the quality of my video call was excellent no skipping or technical issues. The physician was great and very attentive. He was not in a rush, and very thorough.",
        "I have been using Heal since early 2017 and have been quite familiar with a few Doctors. I have used to book for Sick Visit(s), Annual Physical Exams and Flu Shots for both Adult and Children members of the family.  All of our bookings have been on time (well within the 2 hour window). MDs were attentive and very detailed when discussing things (lab work results, diagnosis, care plan) and no one feels rushed.  This app / service saves me a ton of time driving to and from a Dr.'s office, Checking in with the receptionist, validating insurance coverage and the most dreaded grief of waiting.. waiting... and waiting at the lounge with other patients. Prescriptions are even sent electronically to your pharmacy of choice so you just have to wait for a text to let you know it's ready for pick-up.  I have recommended to friends and extended family!",
        "I don't go to the doctor. And have never reviewed anything, but I feel 100% since using this app. I plan to go lick the handles of my nearest Walmart shopping cart so I can use this app again. I wish I could leave 10 stars. 5 for the app, and 5 for my doctor.",
        "Awesome app. No reason to go to a urgent care again. Why get ripped off with surprise bills and secretive pricing when you can get the same (better) level of care at home. Urgent care: 4 minutes with a PA vs Heal: >30 minutes with a MD its a no brainer",
        "Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.",
        "AVOID this service.  Rude and condescending company.  Sent false and misleading e-mails regarding lack of vaccinations.  Had to have pediatrician intervene and this company still won't admit their fault.  As you can see from their response below, they don't care about children with medical exemptions from vaccines due to severe reactions.  AVOID THIS COMPANY!!",
        "Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5",
        "Dr. Life is incredible. She is kind, caring compassionate, and genuinely cares. The app is super easy to use. If you choose televisits, this is the least complicated app ive used, throughout our many months of quarantine. Love Heal, love my doc, love the app. Medical care doesn't get better, or easier, than this!!"
