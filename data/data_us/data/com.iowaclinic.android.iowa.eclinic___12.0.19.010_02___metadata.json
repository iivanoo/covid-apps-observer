        "Good experience, clear and good visual.",
        "Very clear n understanding for everyone",
        "So fast! The dr was super nice. She looked at my history, listened to my current health issue and sent in an antibiotic all in under 10 minutes!",
        "The app worked flawlessly for me. As an older patient, I was leary of this format however the visit went well and the doctor got his information from me and my questions were all answered. For routine follow ups after tests, xrsys or scans, this is great, in my opinion.",
        "Great service! Only one glitch, when I delete any medication from the list I entered for the visit, it always deletes the very top one instead so had to delete them all and re-enter to fix my mistake.",
        "Quick and painless. With everything that is going on, I was able to be seen in under 15 minutes and Matt N. Was very personable and professional. Thanks for making it so simple. Will recommend to anybody to use.",
        "Very easy to use and providers very friendly and knowledgeable!!!!",
        "Good overall but search feature doesn't always show up when looking for your doctor and the interface doesn't snow all offline doctors so you may not see who you are looking for.",
        "Worked well. Provider search didn't show up at first. After selecting menu then going back, the search button shows up. Otherwise easy to use.",
        "It was extremely easy to talk to the provider and share what was wrong. She was able to review my chart and take care of my problem without me even having to leave my bed.",
        "Mid appointment the sound stopped working. Also it would be nice to IM my provider's office and also it would be nice if my PCP came up automatically at the top of my list.",
        "Wonderful app my doctor was very helpful. Having covid kept me home and this made it very easy to get help when I needed it.",
        "Good experience. I did have to turn off Bluetooth and disconnect my smart watch for it to work.",
        "This was a great experience, so much easier than a trip to the office.",
        "This was an easy way to connect with the Doctor and be able to see and continue my care at the Iowa Clinic !!",

        "In the age of social distancing, this is perfect. I get to talk with my Dr. from the privacy of my home. Would recommend to anyone who is high risk for contracting disease",
        "This was a fast, easy way to connect with a doctor and I will definitely use it again!",
        "DR. CHENNUPATI IS THE GREATEST FAMILY DOCTOR IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!! My family loves her!!",
