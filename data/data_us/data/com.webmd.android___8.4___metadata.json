        "Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.",
        "I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.",
        "This app sucks, its slooow, buttons work at random, when they decide to work at all, I couldn't even get far enough in the app to completely describe my ailments. I DON'T RECOMMEND!! I uninstalled immediately after this review.",
        "Do not get this app. YOU WILL BE SPAMMED. I am receiving daily emails. Tried to unsubscribe, but the emails still keep coming. I will be deleting this app",
        "I love how it elaborate and explain. Its not just helpful but learning.",
        "This is such an app for info on medical anything. Including identifying pills that you find in your cabinet and can't remember or know what it is.",
        "Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.",
        "I have found that searching for certain terms, such as \"dementia\", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",
        "A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!",
        "Don't download, you'll get daily spamming. They don't accept unsubscribe.",
        "I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled",
        "It's easy to find the right information you wand plus ways of helping you and showing ways to exercise to help with the problem 1 It gets my vote",
        "many symptoms lacking especially related to brain and psychiatry.",
        "poorest symptom tracker, really irritating. even it cant find acne and pain? better you developers remove this fraud app, or make a proper diagnosis algorithm,, really hate your app.",
        "Too many ads",
        "Good information and podcasts are good.",
        "Tried to give me results before I even have a chance to explain the symptoms. Useless",
        "Symptom checker seldom works properly. You're better off going to Google.",
        "I couldn't find some of the meds I take. I'm not sure if this app is aware of Canadian medicine terms and generic drug names. Uninstalled.",
        "Permanent Email Spam. Literally sent hundreds of messages telling them to quit sending email. Regardless of the number of times you unsubscribe, or tell them to stop, these clowns continue to send it loads of messages. A situation I find completely unacceptable. So for me, it is pure trash.",
        "Probably the least helpful app I've ever used",
        "Useless app! What use is it when it doesnt specify all the diseases known to man. Found it useless when i searched for a common illness without any single result of my search. Moreover, you must choose the required number of illness before you complete your medical check. Nonsense! What use is it? Make a better service instead!",
        "Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.",
        "I do like this app because I also went to the website on my computer. I do wish that they would bring back the old symptom checker rather than the new one cuz I do not like the new interface with it it's a lot harder to navigate than when you could just click on the body parts and then click on the subcategories and go from there",
        "It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays",
        "Always get the straight scoop",
        "Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!",
        "Tried to use the symptom checker but I couldn't even enter knee pain as an option. All of the preselected options were covid-19 symptoms! If this is all that is offered, the symptom checker can be trashed.",
        "Complete trash. I type in painful numb swollen feet the only suggestions you offered was swollen testicles what the heck",
        "This is one of the most helpful apps that I have ever installed on my phone, the most complete and reliable also accurate information about health, medicine, drugs etc, you could ever find online is here!",
        "The old online symptom checker would let you select an area on the body where you had pain. If only the app did, too. This app makes you type in what specific organ/part is causing pain. Well... I don't know specifically where it's coming from. The list they had to choose from didn't seem to apply, anyway. The old online format would then ask additional questions to narrow results down. This app only asked me one question that didn't really get me anywhere.",
        "Great app for getting an idea about medical conditions you may be experiencing. What happened to the visual selection? The one with the picture of the human? I'd much rather select a body part than type and scroll through a list of words. Might work for some people, but I prefer the visual aspect of that selection method. Please bring it back... Just as an additional option. Why take it out?",
        "I only need reminders for meds and supplements. This app only allows you to select pre-set brand name pharmaceuticals. Cannot add your own custom items (such as Cucurmin or Alpha-Lipoic Acid). Also, reminder notifications are not aggressive enough. People with cognitive issues such as Alzheimer's or ADHD will most likely fail to take their meds. The app needs to repeat popup reminders until the user acknowledges taking their scheduled dosage.",
        "this app used to be great. It would give you an avatar to select the affected areas, and a very extensive list of symptoms. It would then have follow up questions about the symptoms you chose. Now you must enter it all manually, and there are no follow up questions. In my opinion, this used to the best symptom checker available, but now it's just garbage.",
        "Honestly, I miss the old symptom checker. It seemed to be more accurate. This new form says (Over Exaggeration) that I died 7 years ago. I know nothing beats a living breathing medical professional, but none happen to be open today (Sunday) with out going to ER. In my profession, Saturday and Sunday are just days when no one's around.",
        "I miss the old symptom checker interface. I mostly used this app to help figure out the vocabulary of the parts involved with my symptoms but now I don't have a place to start. I also do not like all the added features, I have separate apps for those and it's creating clutter on my device. I'd rather have an app that does one thing well than a bunch of things poorly.",
        "This is a very helpful app to have on hand. It's versatile to many ailments and conditions. Saves a trip to the Dr or at least gives you symptons you can arm yourself with before going. Especially where children are concerned. I use it for my grown daughters and their grown kids. A must have app.",
        "Great information so helpful\ud83d\ude4f in so many ways. There are so many topics are useful to read. Its informative & I find interest in learning something new. WebMD talks about health, preparing for procedures, biopsies, etc ,. Being aware\ud83d\udc40 gives me an extra advantage of what's happening today. I always say do your homework before having anything medically done. Because knowing early will make the difference in life or death. Highly recommend subscribing.\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb",
        "The symptom checker doesn't work. It freezes and doesn't show any results for basic symptoms such as \"headache\" or \"weakness\". Uninstalled.",
        "I found it of good help to understand my symptoms"
