App doesn't provide any anonymized statistics on your contact experience: how many people via bluetooth did you pass by today? How long was the longest duration of contacts? Etc App requests access to contacts list. My contact list has nothing to do with my possible exposure risk in public settings. People at stores or work are not in my contact list.",
