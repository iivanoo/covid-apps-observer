However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it\u2019s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what\u2019s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. \r\n \r\nNote: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.",

        "I love this app! So much more convenient and cost effective for managing my and my family's care. Instead of having to make a Dr. Appt and often being told the next available appointment is ina few weeks I can have an appointment right now... in my house and on my time... 24/7!",
        "Love this app. Fabulous and thorough care and so convenient! Start to finish \"visit\" took about 10 min and was able to get the medication i needed very quickly.",
        "The app is great and the service is quick. They do have some limitations that will require a visit to your primary care doctor... but this is a great service for what it is!",

        "They are so professional and helpful. In a time when I was literally turned away from visiting my primary doctor how refreshing that these wonderful people are there 24/7 for us....",
        "As someone without insurance, this app is invaluable because it allows me to access care that I need, including my asthma medications, antidepressants, migraine preventives, and sick notes for work! A three month trial subscription is only $30, and each visit is only $1. A year subscription is $120. Even if you have insurance, this app is a money saver \ud83e\udd70",

        "Super fast and easy! Beats trying to get an in-office visit for those times it's not really needed.",

        "Was easy and Dr. DeRouen explained things well.",
        "Always great. The doctors are friendly quick and courteous.",
        "I will say I stand by 98point6, as it has helped me so many times when I can't go in because work hours or school, I can reach out and get help that is honestly better than what I'm used to getting in person from friendly knowledgeable people.",

        "I have nothing but good things to say about the 98point6 app. This is one of the employee benefits I get through my employer, and my doctor visits are totally free. I have used the app twice now, and never have I been charged or received any kind of a bill. It's so easy to use, and an appointment only takes minutes. My prescriptions are sent directly over to my pharmacy of choice. The entire visit is done through text messaging on my phone. I would highly recommend!",
