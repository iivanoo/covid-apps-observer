        "Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.",
        "I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relativ6es results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.",
        "Unable to get a 4 digit pin to open app after the first time. So every time I use it, I have to uninstall and get a new 6 digit access code. One problem is therevis no method to go anywhere without that 4 digit pin. All of you folks who like it have probably only tried to log in once.\ud83d\ude09",
        "All it does is show results. There is nothing in this app for tracing, etc. All it does is show your results and even that, they only appear hours, day after it is issued. Don't see the point of this app... Really.",
        "This app gives more than 20 texts one right after another for each notification. It does not do contact tracing to give you notice if you've come in contact with somebody else's covid+. This app is practically useless, doing what it claims to do and it's annoying on top of it. This is basically a governor announcement app. HowWeFeel is an app that is really good and gives a lot more information. It's what I use to help with combating covid-19 worldwide.",
        "App won't work, keeps saying it isn't responding, asks if you want to wait or close app, they also have my first name wrong, so I can't find out results. Wish there was a direct line phone # to call.",
        "Thank you for your suggestion. After clearing the Google Play cache it froze again at 63% (same as before). Then I had to cancel the download again and then try again and then it worked.",
        "I have received the notification that my results are available, which I think it's fantastic and timely, however I can't get past my birthdate and relationship to patient.... I have not been able to see my results.",
        "I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.",
        "My date of birth was incorrect therefore I am not able to access my test results. My doctor verified with me that they have my correct date of birth. The Florida Department of Health said they cannot give me test results and to submit a ticket through healthy Together app. Customer service emailed me back and said that they cannot help me and that my doctor has to resubmit the correct date of birth. My Dr verified with me they had the correct date of birth. I can't get my test results.",
        "Can't even login. Had a pin texted to me. I typed the numbers but there is no button to press for enter and the \"next\" function just moves the cursor around. Edited to add: could not make app work on Samsung Galaxy S10 but it did work on older S7.",
        "App would not download no option to check results...total ineptitude. Please provide a contact phone..total app failure...the email to address concerns has gone unanswered. A customer service failure....I am losing business by the minute and the state does not know answers...the county does not know answers...the health care district dies nit kno w answers and your company has no contact info.. .incredible",
        "Very unhelpful. After creating an account I was able to see mime and my daughters names that our test results were in. However, when entering our birthdays, ot stated that BOTH of our birthdays are incorrect with what the testing site has on file. Kind of odd, since I filled out both of our paperwork, and have been entering the correct birthdays. Thankfully, we were given a paper copy of and we do know our results. I have downloaded and used the app simply out of curiosity. Uninstalling now.",
        "Stuck downloading at 63 percent. If you have this problem take it off Wi-fi. Solved the issue for me. Other than that easy to use except I couldn't find the option to add one of my kids.",
        "This App Refuses to Download...First it was stuck on 63% so I cancelled the download and restarted my phone. Now the download is just pending. I have never had trouble downloading an app even when the app size is 8+ mb.",
        "I went and got my children and myself tested. The app stated that the results were ready for us all however, I'm trying to get the results for my oldest child, however it's not providing me results when the contact information is the same for all three individuals. Can someone please assist me in getting the information for my eldest child. Updated: The provider has the correct information and it was entered correctly, yet the results are still not showing for the my entire family.",
        "Text received which said results are ready, but result is NOT available on the app. This is very disappointing...getting my hopes up for the result and then....nothing. .waiting again....",
        "Had to uninstall 5 of my personal apps to install this one and it doesn't work. It's invasive and I'm unhappy. It couldn't even send me the pin it required me to request. -registered nurse",
        "This app. seems to be useless. After I downloaded it successfuly to my laptop, I clicked the results icon and got just another picture of the phone icon. Absoultely useless.",
        "Worked perfectly the first time for me. Thanks! Test results appeared here several hours before available from my provider's portal.",
        "Endless loop, I keep signing in (4 times so far) and it keeps saying it will be installed. Pretty useless. And I can't get the results of my covid19 test.",
        "Can't get past the birthdate screen to get results, just keeps cycling back to same DOB screen. App in its current state has no value.",
        "I did my test on Monday and got the result Wednesday.I used the play store app.It was like 123, no complaint .Everything went through without a hitch.All i did was follow the instruction that was given.",
        "I don't see an option for what to do if the testing site clearly has your child's birthday wrong. They misspelled her name while there and I had that corrected but apparently they also messed up her birthday. They should have just had me fill it all out.",
        "I had absolutely no issues with the website. Download was quick. And my results were right there.",
        "Well, Healthy Reviews has reached Florida just in time to screw up my life. As other reviewers have mentioned, I'm stuck at 63% and the stupid app won't install past that. Don't you guys at Twenty Inc. think there might be a problem? (New review) I appreciate the answer from Twenty Inc. I managed to get the app d/l on my own a couple of days later using many years of experience with PCs. However, my Covid test results were not there or in MyChart where CVS was supposed to post them.",
        "It is a nightmare to use, it ask me for a pin I never got... when I place the code I got in my inbox it doesn't work! useless...",
        "Ate you kidding me I have to purchase this to get results?I have already paid for this through my medical insurance.this needs to be tooken down why should I add contacts for a test results. What kind of gimmick is this? Shame on you shame!.dont reply back with same answers you gave to others.no pin dont work .do you think I should ask you for contact list off your phone.?yes. Shame shame to use people dying health in this way",
        "This app is junk does not work and this is important stuff that the tested need to know.they should just give us a call and leave us a voice message because this b******* out does not work and it's not cool it's not fair it's not right we're talking about a person's health.",
        "I had a very good experience with this app, very easy to use, got my pin with no problems. Happy using this app",
        "We got a notification about our test results being in the app. Once we get in the app the only results there are my wife's. Not showing mine or my daughter's. Really unsatisfied with this app",
        "Your app is asking for a pin for me to unlock it but it never gave me the chance to setup a pin. There is also no Settings tab for me to go to to try to setup a pin.",
        "EDIT: YAY!!! THANK YOU FOR RESOLVING THE PROBLEM WITH PLAYSTORE SO QUICKLY. \ud83d\ude03 \u2764\ud83d\udc9a Awful!!! I want my results today. It's ready. App stops at 63%. 12/24/20.",
        "This app is terrible, I have been trying for 3 days to get my results. I installed the app, got the pin #, tried using the pin and it says \"wrong pin.\" I tried twice, b/c it says you will be logged off after 3 tries. So, I started all over, still no luck. I have had two emails stating my results are ready.",
        "I have 2 children under my same phone #. I only get results for myself but can't get the others because it only recognized me when logging in under phone #.",
        "Need to get there act together, should not have to use a app install software it still doesn't give me my results stop wasting my time steep up offer a much better way to give clients there results that doesn't have to involve using a app doesn't work, i beyond upset at scared heart, I quiet you fix you give me results , I don't reccmond this app company I chose baptist ER walk get my test I'm given my results",
        "Downloaded app used code given to me in separate msg. Then it asked for my pin???? What pin was I supposed to create pin ???? It never gave me option to create pin.",
        "Horrible app. I said my results were ready to be viewed. Two days later and my results were still not posted.",
        "Logged in to get my son's results and it has locked me out and there is no phone # to call to get it u locked. Have been waiting days to get the results now nothing. Not happy.",
        "Worked as well as to be expected. Easily downloaded and prompt notification of test results."
