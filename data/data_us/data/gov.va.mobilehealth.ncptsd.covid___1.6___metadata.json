        "A great app with a wide range of useful tools for coping with stress, Covid Coach offers practices, learning, resources and assessments based on sound psychological science. There is an ability to favorite your favorite practices for quick use and the interface is simple and easy to use. Functions well and haven't had any glitches. I have only been using a short time, but the notifications and engagement have been useful.",
        "I don't know why I resisted using an emotional support app but I did. Originally I downloaded this Covid Coach to evaluate it before recommending it to tech preference friends. Now utilizing this app for myself is supportive in ways that surprise me. It reminds me to USE the tools I have which allows me to have more choice in my days & nights. This ultimately allows me to have a life more of my choosing. By acknowledging where I'm at with my scheduled check-ins I choose what to do from there.",
        "Helpful resources on any app capable mobile phone is an excellent app that is at no cost to anyone! Typically an app like this charges a subscription fee but this one doesn't. Thank you very much for this!",

        "Excellent Resources and Service.",

        "Some times when things are hard i need a reminder/ nudge to take a step back from the situation. short messages and practices.are just the thing for getting back on the track of mindfulness.",
        "This app is terrific. I've tried several other wellness or meditation apps, and this one is out of the park in its offerings. Plus the narrator voices are calming. There's an outstanding number of exercises for various approaches, and all I've tried were helpful. Well done!",
        "I was excited for this app. Unfortunately this app REQUIRES access to your phone. After downloading, a prompt will say: \"Allow Covid Coach to access photos, media, and files on your device?\" As soon as I tap on \"deny\" the app automatically closes and locks me out of the service. How is this supposed to be helping me? You don't need access to my phone. I'm disappointed.",

        "A great resource during a difficult time. Especially love the daily messages and \"mood music\".",
        "There should be no reason this app needs media, phone and Gallery permissions just to launch. Especially when it prompts you that you can disable them later.",
        "Amazing app! And best part is that it's completely free with no strings attached or any data-mining to worry about.",
        "I'm not done exploring it yet but so far it's user friendly",
