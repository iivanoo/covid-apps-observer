It took 3.5 hours mostly because the doctor took between 10-15 minutes to respond to me. I believe the longest I waited for him to respond was 30 minutes. On top of all that, I was told he wasn't currently able to provide a doctor's note due to current limitations within the app. Waste of money and time.",

Even that might be workable, but there are huge gaps in the symptom checker. I can't start with hypertension or high blood pressure as a symptom? Terrible, frustrating design.",
