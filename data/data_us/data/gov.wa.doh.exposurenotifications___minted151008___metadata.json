    "description": "WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.\r\n\r\nYour voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nHow WA Notify works:\r\nWhen devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nApple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.\r\n\r\nHow WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:\r\nWashington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.\r\n\r\nState law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.\r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!",

        "The second you turn Bluetooth off it annoys the hell out of you to turn it back on. There needs to be functionality that addresses this gap as people will discontinue use due to the annoyance. Reading the reviews here does not give me confidence that positive cases are being captured properly (even if the person tests positive and gets a verification code by doh) due to the delay from the point they positive test, to them talking to DOH WA to get the code. 2 days to weeks, to possibly never.",
        "App worked as expected for the first 2 months, however this morning I see a notice that I need to have location turned on as well as bluetooth. This is unnerving seeing that the app settings on my phone show no permissions are in use. I have android 6 but this same concern is being voiced by an android 9 user here in the comments. This behaviour is new and as I can only toggle location globally on my device this is NOT going to happen. This behaviour is similar to malware. Please correct.",
        "This app was a good idea, but there wasn't much thought put into the development of it. There is no way to enter a positive result or exposure without a verification code. This makes the app entirely pointless since I know of nine positive results with no phone calls being dodged, just no way to get a code. This seems like a pretty big oversight.",
        "I do not need constant notifications that my bluetooth is off - it drains my battery, so I only turn it on when I'm at risk of exposure, which is not often. There needs to be on option to turn that notification off, because it's so irritating that I'm on the verge of uninstalling this app, which kind of defeats its purpose, don't you think?",
        "Got notified today of a possible exposure from last week. I could figure out where I was since I had the date, and go get tested immediately. I wish the app said you SHOULD get tested not only if you have symptoms as the testing center wasn't sure if I met testing criteria. But glad I had the app installed if I can prevent further spread.",
        "App seems like it would be useful, but you need a verification code to give a positive result, and nobody knows how to get this code. My friend tested positive and I didn't receive any alert after being near her because she didn't get any info about a verification code, even when she asked about it. Being able to self report would make this much more useful.",
        "I tested positive and the app wouldn't let me notify people. It turns out the app needs a code, given by Washington State department of health employees when they call you for a phone survey/interview. I received positive test results on Sunday 1/17 and received a phone call follow up on Tuesday 1/19. I brought up the code and was given it, but that was only after the entire call was completed with no mention of the code or app. If I hadn't brought it up it would not have come up otherwise.",
        "Nice concept, but poor execution on letting the public know it is available, and letting them know how the app works and what safeguards are in place to protect their privacy. To many people think the app will share personal information, so are unwilling to download it. This is making the app unusable as it was designed to be used. If only one person out of a hundred has downloaded it and is using it, then what use is having it on your phone?",
        "Too soon to tell but could be very useful. They need to have a share that you can choose which app store to refer people Apple or Google. This one just sends a Google link which is useless for my wife and daughter. Hopefully they will add this. The real key is getting enough people to use it in this paranoid, conspiracy following world. Thanks for the quick response and good luck!",
        "This app causes issues with all other Bluetooth devices, including my Fitbit (will not sync with this app installed) and my headphones (will randomly disconnect from headphone while in use). There is no option to disable the app. While I am at home, I wish I could disable the app. Especially if I am not having people come to my house.",
        "The concept is fine but the fact that we are relying on someone who has the virus to input a code that no one seems to know about makes this app pretty useless. The last year has proven to us that we cannot rely on people to do the right thing so that makes this app double useless. This would have been far more useful if it kept the bluetooth device pinging but used every device's phone number and compared it against a database of known infected person's phone numbers.",
        "I received a call 8 hours after doing a Covid test and was told I was positive but no one knew about the verification code for this app. This app is pointless if not all hospitals to include the military know how to use it or know how to provide the access code. It needs to be more user friendly.",
        "Constantly alerts if you ever have gps or bluetooth off so if it ever tries to give me a virus alert, I won't notice it. Update: I don't care about data or battery. I turn things off because I don't want internet dog food ads for driving past a pet store and I only go out once a week for groceries; no guests.",
        "I received a notification that I was exposed on a day where I had kept my phone in a space not shared with others (no shared wall, etc), as I do every work day. In other words, no one spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of my phone. It is a healthcare facility, so there is little doubt the \"exposure\" was generated here, but it seems that either the location sharing probably far exceeds 6 feet, or is far less than 15 minutes in order for me to be alerted to exposure.",
        "Keep it up to date as this is going to be 6 to 9 more months long. Permissions are actually at an os level for both Android and ios, meaning you probably got an os update that you opped into in July or August. Go to settings, search for Contact, and exposure tracing will come up.",
        "Every time I try to turn on the notification, it shows a meaningless error message \"something went wrong. Try again\", not sure what to do after retrying a dozen times.",
        "Nobody knows how to get this code. When state officials reached out, they didn't even know what this app is and couldn't give me the code. UPDATE: the process is improving and I ended up getting the code. Changing from 1 to 4 stars. This app can save many lives.",
        "Just got this so too soon to rate, but I have a question. I am an urgent care provider testing patients for COVID so will definitely be in proximity to positive cases. I wish this app had a setting for when you are at work where exposures are protected and another for when you are away from work where exposures may be unprotected.",
        "My husband has covid and it still says I do not have a exposure... Been almost a week now..... So zero faith in this app",
        "Deleting off phone. Why have an app to notify or be notified of a positive when I was not given a code. Almost pointless in conservative part of Washington.",
        "Zaps your battery! This app clearly wants to locate a track everyone's location at all the times. While Democrats love this communistic idea; it's frightening how much info one has to agree to give the Government through this app. Not to mention, it is glittered with set up issues and the GPS tracking milks your battery!",
        "For those confused about how to report a POSITIVE test result: WA Notify requires users to confirm positive tests using a verification code provided by public health officials. The code is not tied to a person\u2019s identity. After the code is entered, WA Notify can match the random codes of users who have been nearby and notify them of possible exposure. The notification does not include any information about who may have exposed them or where the exposure happened. All it takes is reading....",
        "I think this app will be more useful if more people use it. People are afraid you are tracking their movement's. Need more advertising! The conspiracy theory people will never use it. Sane people will. Thank You",
        "No code. Can't make it work. UPDATE: According to developer reply, I should have gotten a code from health Dept... I did not. I did an online interview a month after having covid-19, but no code.",
        "I came into contact with 2 people for a few hrs that tested positive 2 days later. They both have this app.. They were both called by the health dept and neither of them were asked about the App or given a code. None of us were aware that you had to be given a code?",
        "\"When someone in WA state tests positive for COVID-19 and public health reaches out to them, they will be asked if they have WA Notify and given a verification code. With surging cases, this may take several days.\" => Seriously? It takes you several days to generate a verification code? And I'm paying taxes for this kind of unprofessionalism? Gov. Inslee, please fire the team that is unable to generate codes instantly for people to add to the app and hire someone better.",
        "Not accurate at all. I have never received notification of a possible exposure ever. I do Mobile Covid Testing.",
        "The concept is good. I need to be able to put in co-workers who have tested positive but dont use the app.",
        "It's been a few escrering moment but, better get the alert than the \ud83e\udd12.",
        "Pierce County public health finally reached me for my interview today (12/26), over 10 days after testing posirive, but that is not the app's fault.",
        "Lots of fun. Get lost and enjoy!",
        "Great idea, unable to use app without a \"verification code\" but where do you get this code? It sure isn't the one with your test results.",
        "This app doesn't track you! Google does that. The more downloads the better it will work. Get it!",
        "Downloaded when there was only 1500 other downloads and am so happy to see this app over 100k downloads now! Helps make me believe in doing this.",
        "Contact tracing should be great. App installs easily and is \"set it and forget it\" easy. Unfortunately you have to get a \"verification code\" in order to notify the system of a positive result (and thus notify those contacts that they've been exposed). The problem is NOBODY knows how to get a verification code to put in the app (I called and spoke with 2 of the largest county health departments, as well as the WA State DOH)! Pretty useless if it can't be used to notify others of an exposure!",
        "Great idea, but the execution needs improvement. Bluetooth function must be on all the time to get accurate notification. My bluetooth drains my battery so that's not going to work. Why can't the app communicate within itself to identify if another user has been nearby and has received a positive test? Also, if a person has all the symptoms they should be able to self report. I appreciate the states making an effort but this needs to be on a national level for people who need to travel.",
        "So far so good on this app, though it's a little worrysome that the app doesn't have any explicit permissions granted, nor does it ask for any, yet still seems to be able to access a wide swath of things on the device. This feels like a security concern for the device itself, as without permissions requests, it's impossible for users to determine when something changes in the application which widens its permission scope. That's a concern because it's one of the more common malware vectors.",
        "doesn't allow me? to turn on \uff0ckeep asking try again. NOT be able to use it. useless.",
        "Small app space even on older phones, great privacy controls, needs more advertising. The more people use this, THE BETTER IT WILL WORK: As it uses Bluetooth to reach out to other users and notifies you if someone reports they tested positive and were in proximity to you, so you know to test/quarantine. 1. Install the app 2. Test when needed 3. Use the \"share\" button to let your friends and loved ones know!",
        "it doesn't notify me at all. we had 2 positive at work but this never notified me. its not working."
