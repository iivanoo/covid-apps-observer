    "description": "NM Notify is the official Notification App of New Mexico and the New Mexico Department of Health. It uses Bluetooth technology to alert you when you have been in contact or close proximity to someone that has tested positive for COVID-19. The app uses the Bluetooth technology on your phone to exchange anonymous codes with anyone in your proximity with the same app. If one of those people should become infected within 14 days of your contact, you will be alerted. You'll be told that you have been in contact with someone that has tested positive for COVID-19. Then it will advise you on what steps to take to keep you and others around you safe. Likewise, if you test positive for COVID-19 you can upload your \"positive\" code and anyone that you have been in contact with will receive an alert. It's completely anonymous, you won't know and others won't know who exposed who.",

        "Currently cannot get the app to work. Installed & tried opening, but kept quitting. Sent feedback. Deinsed, then reinstalled, but same problem. Sent feedback again. Have no idea if this is a good app since it's not working for me. Although in theory, it's a good idea. I've been vaccinated, but it's still good to know. Wish it worked.",
        "What is the point in having this installed if it only works not even a fraction of the time?? Half the time I get an error notification about being \"unable to check for exposures at this time\" and thats with my bluetooth on 24/7 or get timestamps when I'm not around anyone.",
        "It's persistent. I keep getting notifications my bluetooth isn't on so they can't notify me if I'm exposed. When I am home alone which I usually am I don't need the bluetooth on. I will put it on when I leave my house.",
        "I thoroughly appreciate this app. I have a Samsung S7 and the app closed as soon as I clicked it. However, 3/25/21 the update fixed the problem. PS the developer contact email is not valid.",
        "All the app does is share anon covid test results from one phone, (If Positive) alert phones that have been near by that phone, encouraging them to get tested. Simple, Basic, But really Useful.",
        "Simple, non-invasive (privacy-wise), and works on my One Plus 6 phone. To be truly useful, more people would need to install it.",
        "From what I can tell, it works well. Issue being this should have come out a LONG time ago... And even then it doesn't really work if not everyone is using it. But I will continue to do so.",
        "Sure does suck the life out of your battery. Haven't had any notifications for anyone who's tested positive for the virus.",
        "The app seemed to just sit idle till today. Today it sent a notification. So far it is doing what it's suppose to do.",
        "Thank you for trying to keep us updated. The app keeps crashing when opening.",
        "It down loaded on Android but all my Apple devices \ud83c\udf4f it can't locate the App in the App store.",
        "Works on my Galaxy S8 but crashes on Galaxy S6.",
        "Installed with no issues on moto g6. Glad NM put one of these together!",
        "So far it works fine. More people will need to sign up and download it for it to be considered useful",
        "Using for 1 week how would I know if it's working? It's creepy. I don't like it. I don't want to be forced to use these things or get vaccinated. When did America turn into a prison camp?",
        "Excited about this new tool in efforts to stop the spread of COVID here in NM. The more NM residents who download this app the sooner we can get back to life as we previously knew it. Thanks Gov. MLG for all your efforts.",
        "Just crashes. Pointless.",
        "Another layer of protection and peace of mind.",
        "Force closes. Does not run on my device (Blackview BV9500).",
        "Won't open. Just crashes.",
        "It does not let me open it without crashing",
        "Excellent tool for Stopping the Spread of COVID-19!",
        "Yes! Thanks, NMDOH, for releasing an exposure notification app!",
        "It doesn't work. Keeps closing!!!?",
        "Cannot open the app at all. Total failure for me. Someone else mentioned that the problem could be an older phone. I'm sure the people who can afford the latest and greatest after a year of the pandemic are in the minority. Gotta fix that DOH.",
        "Great way to learn about covid exposure",
        "The app just keeps crashing whenever I try to open it. And looking at the reviews, a ton of people are having the same issue.",
        "It is working now thank you",
        "Didn't notify me of anything and nagged at me to turn on my Bluetooth. It doesn't do anything.",
        "Downloaded it and it will not open",
        "Flag as spam.",
        "Great notification response",
        "Downloads but immediately fails on a Samsung Galaxy S7. Have uninstalled it.",
        "Doesn't work",
        "The app does not work like it should work. For starters, the installation!",
        "Barely downloaded it and it crashed on my first time opening it.",
        "Can't have bluetooth constantly coming on.",
        "works gr8 for me",
        "Does not work. It won't even open.",
        "Can't open on galaxy j7"
