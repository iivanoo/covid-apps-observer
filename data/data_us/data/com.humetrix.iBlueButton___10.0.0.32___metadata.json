With iBlueButton, you have in your hands at all times your medical information to better manage your healthcare, avoid preventable medical errors, and receive safer and more effective care. \r\n\r\niBlueButton won the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button\u00ae program, to give Americans the ability to access their Blue Button health records. iBlueButton was the first native mobile application approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Americans covered by Medicare to make use their Medicare Blue Button data to receive safer healthcare. iBlueButton is also one of only four applications approved by the VA for Veterans to access their VA health records and has been partner of the VA since 2011, and in 2021 iBlueButton was the first mobile application approved by Humana.\r\n\r\nFor Medicare and Humana beneficiaries along with their approved caregivers, iBlueButton lets you login into your account at MyMedicare.gov or Humana and retrieve your medical history. Your health information is automatically translated on your phone or tablet from your Medicare or Humana claim  information into an organized medical history in all of its useful details. \r\n\r\nWhen accessing VA or your other healthcare provider health records, iBlueButton additionally displays your lab results in organized lab panels with indication of normal ranges and graphs so that you can see lab value trends overtime. To get more information for each laboratory test, iBlueButton provides one-tap look ups through Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of Medicine. \r\n\r\n- ALL IN YOUR HANDS\r\niBlueButton pulls and organizes multiple records into a single Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections (medications, conditions, laboratory test results, etc.) and your detailed medical history (physician visits, hospitalizations, etc.). This Summary Record is available at all times to review, research, share, print and annotate critical health information. iBlueButton\u2019s on device architecture fosters privacy and security and allows for data to be accessible even if you are not connected to the Internet.\r\n\r\n- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS\r\nWhether it is about the medications you currently take, a new one recently prescribed, an existing condition, or new medical condition iBlueButton automatically generates safety warnings and best care practices based on well-established guidelines. iBlueButton now also offers COVID-19 related alerts, including an alert if you are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, and an alert about eligibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\n- LIFE AND COST SAVING\r\nOn average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians and most of the time any one of these physicians will not have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel and their families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place not only in VA and military health facilities, but also in the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.\r\n\r\n- SECURE AND PRIVATE\r\nUnlike most personal health applications, iBlueButton stores your information securely encrypted on your own mobile device. Under your sole control, your personal health information is retrieved by your app from the data source and goes directly on your mobile device where it is securely stored.

        "Along with my Medicare records, I'm now also getting records from my physicians. Great to have it all in one place.",
        "after update, deleted all my data and will not import new data from VA",
        "Just discovered that I can get my Humana info with this app. Super helpful. Easy to use.",
        "I would recommend it but it just keeps circling me back to the DS log-on after tapping on VA's button for my records. I was able to access it once after downloading the app. I was checking out my current appointments, meds, vaccinations & diagnoses from provider visits. However, I had to start all over after I tried getting more info for the latest appointment tha I got. Clicked on it & the cycle of the DS log-on started. Frustrating.",
        "Terrible app! The UI is cluttered and isn't intuitive. I was hoping to use iBlueButton to link my VA medical records, but it's not any better than the VA's My HealtheVet website. Don't waste your time with this app.",
        "After using iBlueButton for a couple of months I noticed it was not updating my information.  The Humetrix support team was friendly, responsive, and pro-active in addressing the issues I had with the app.  As I reported issues they fixed them promptly and genuinely seemed to appreciate my input.  IBlueButton is a useful app with the best customer support I've seen in years.",
        "As a physician caring for elderly parents on Medicare, I highly recommend that all of my colleagues taking care of Medicare patients let each of them know about this app. The medication alerts warning users of drugs which are often inappropriate for those over 65 and of dangerous drug-drug interactions combined with the detailed medical history provided will help ensure that patients receive safer care.",
        "Just got this app and found several important medication warnings including one about a dangerous interaction between two drugs. I knew some of this but not all ... good to have these alerts. Also got to see list of all my doctors with their contact details. As a Medicare parient at Kaiser, this app gives me really useful information I cannot get using my Kaiser app.",
        "I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.",
        "It's remarkable the level of medical information this app is giving me. I had hip surgery last year and through that one issue there are literally tons of info items related to the surgery and hospital stay, including the contact info of other doctors besides the hip surgeon.",
        "This was a total waste of my time. It ask for dates for things in your childhood that no one would ever remember to add it. It also does not have all the medications that I am taking. What is the deal of listing pharmaceutical companies for meds when people go to stores to get meds? Why not just list the med. This is a useless app and a Big waste of time.",
        "Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at \"higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.\". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.",
        "Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.",
        "Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.",
        "Found out about this app on Medicare website and tried it out. Amazing that you can get such useful information from your Medicare record. Great app!",
        "Helped my grand-aunt get this after seeing a demo of it at a caregivers conference here in San Diego. She is in her 80s and has lots of health issues, and this app is a big help to keep track of important medical details.",
        "Using this app I found not one but two pretty huge errors in the information a doctor provided to Medicare, including a medication condition I never had. Recommend.",
        "This is such a useful app for helping me and so many of my older friends to stay healthy. So easy to use. Great app!",
        "Helping my older brother a disabled Vet also on Medicare I like this app combining all health information. Useful and straight forward to use.",
        "App won't even open anymore. Just says some error code and that there is a problem with the server. What is the deal!",
        "Amazing, I never thought I'd be able to get my medical information organized onto my phone, but this app does it.",
        "Friend on Medicare told me about this app and it's for real. All my Medicare history in one place with helpful drug warnings. Super informational.",
        "Super helpful. Got my VA and Medicare records quickly and now have them both in one place.",
        "This app is of great help to keep track of and make sense of all the medications my dad takes.",
        "Really well done app and super easy to use. Helps make sense of medical jargon.",
        "This has been so helpful in taking care of my Mom. It has been overwhelming at times and this app is a big help.",
        "As a vet and also on Medicare I found this app easy to use and very useful.",
        "If you are on Medicare download this app! Amazing! It just warned me that a medication I just picked up at the pharmacy should not be taken with another medication I am on without speaking to my doctor first.",
        "An incredibly helpful app, turning medical jargon into insights I can understand.",
        "As a vet and on Medicare have been using this and it's just great.",
        "Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.",
        "Piece of mind app to have everything you need to remember to assist your loved ones.",
        "crashes more often than anything. With the new upgrades this app is unusable. Can I get a rollback?",
        "So useful to keep track of my Mom's medications. Recommend if caring for an elder parent.",
        "Nifty tool for organizing my health info. Really like the medication warnings.",
        "My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!",
        "A must have for folks on Medicare. Getting my record was a breeze and I'm seeing lots of things I didn't even know about.",
        "The medication alerts are very useful. Very pleased with the app",
        "Worth it for just the medication alerts, not to mention everything else.",
        "Helping my mom with all of her health issues and this app is amazingly helpful."
