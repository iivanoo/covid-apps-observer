        "This is a great app. In this day and age of covid-19 I don't feel unsafe going to a doctor's office. The system has been working fine for me so far and I give it five stars!",
        "Good and easy to use",
        "I would give it 5 stars but volume is a problem. I have my volume up to the max and can barely hear my provider. UPDATE Went to 5 Stars, volume was much better today!",
        "Works great. Nearly flawless. Slight delay such that you have to carefully take turns speaking. It's not quite as fast switching between speakers as zoom.",
        "Great quality. A communication dropout did occur for 3 minutes but automatic recovery worked.",
        "Very pleasant, app is easy to use and saved me a trip to the office",
        "Really easy to use, a great way to see a doctor!",
        "Easy to connect great picture and sound",
        "Very relaxing informative and convenient.",
        "Great ap as long as your dr can use it... :0)",
        "App worked well and wa easy to set upa on LG tablet",
        "Difficult to connect...wifi issues",
        "This video call went extremely well!",
        "Efficient app that functioned perfectly for me.",
        "The visit was not as good as when i use othet apps. The doctor kept freezing every other second. The visit completely cut off once and the doctor had to reboot. It seemed as though every time she looked at something else on her computer the visit froze. Very annoying. We both kept having to repeat. The visit therefore probably took longer because of this. Also, i had given my medications to the assistant over the phone. But i spent 20 minutes inputing my medications and was late entering t",
        "The app worked just fine. Thank you.",
        "I just had my 1st tele-health appointment and absolutely loved it. Under the circumstances that our country is currently operating under with COVID-19, I feel so much safer having my quarterly follow up appointments this way, provided nothing in particular is bothering me. I highly recommend this tele-health type of appointment for those who know IF your body's medical issues are going well BUT you must also know IF you need to SEE your physician when you are NOT feeling well.",
        "This was a very streamlined process; I downloaded the app ten minutes before my appointment and set up an account, then spoke with my doctor shortly thereafter. The doctor herself was knowledgeable and kind. I definitely feel safer during this pandemic knowing that I can easily see a competent doctor without having to leave my house.",
        "I love how you can see yourself and the provider. At times its hard to just stare at a person on video chat so this give you an opportunity to look at yourself if needed to get rid of the nervous jitters. Only crappy part was the sound we couldn't hear each other at times.",
        "I am not good with computers or applications using computers. At first i didn't know how to install an application at all, but i did it",
        "It is a great experience, they have the best way of making you feel welcome You feel as if you are sitting in the office with them",
        "Good. Need to connect quicker!",
        "App is great. Just needs some better options for chatting. I had to keep my phone to my head to be able to hear. Convo cut out just once. Picture was blurry but movement wasn't delayed. Speech wasn't delayed.",
        "Audio did not work - incredible echo occurred. We had to mute mics and talk via speaker phones. The video was good. I had to sign in twice - not sure why screen was lost first time.",
        "Very convenient! Loved it. Aside from a pixelated video and a little delay, it was awesome!",
        "App or emails will not work with more than one doctor. I needed to have a different email and account for each different health care provider.",
        "Very good and thorough.",
        "This app was easy to work with. I just had my first Telehealth experience and thought it was marvelous!",
        "Very convenient while the country copes with this emergency. Also would be a great option for someone who has trouble finding transportation. You don't have to be a computer whiz to get the app up and running. JS",
        "It was east to set up, I could see my doctor fine and the sound quality was very good. A little issue with lag time.Overall great experience",
        "My experience is a little unique I'm kind of old school but I can get used to this it does help when you have narcolepsy it's a lot safer overall I think it's great sincerely yours",
        "Helpful for time saving and putting miles on your vehicle, however, it is limited on overall diagnostics and care without seeing your provider in person.",
        "The qual-ity of this app is bey-ond belief! A-udio and video crisp and clear! Can't say en-ough about how -important this capability is. Our hos-pital syst-em has cho-sen wise-ly! AAAA+++ Health Quest!",
        "The app had a small connection issue, but was quickly resolved. The video was very clear soiund wise.",
        "This is the first telehealth app that actually worked well on my Android! It went so well I wish all my providers would use it!",
        "Wouldn't work on my laptops. Had to use my phone. Camera issues with app on both. And yes, I used the Windows app for them.",
        "Had some trouble at first but that was because of my error \ud83d\ude2cwhat an excellent way to see your doctor i didn't have to leave work ,miss any time .I definitely recommend this app for anyone to use.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf9",
        "Needed to speak to my doctor when I was unavailable to visit... This app help to make that happen . Video quality was great.",
        "Straight forward to setup and connect. Only comment when making a password they should mention a number is needed.",
        "It was a good way to have a visit without having to leave the house during this pandemic. The sound was a little problematic some of the time."
