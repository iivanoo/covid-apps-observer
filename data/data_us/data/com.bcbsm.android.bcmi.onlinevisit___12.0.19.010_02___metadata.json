        "What a FANTASTIC experience! You can choose from several doctors, and you can see how they look and their experience. The only thing missing, obviously, is a physical exam, but how nice to be treated and not have to leave home!",
        "I used it for online doctor consult. Took me 10 minutes and cost $10 !",
        "So this was incredibly easy to set up. Was able to create an account, list all my symptoms and see a doctor within about 45 minutes. That's just awesome. Thank you very much for making the entire process incredibly seamless.",
        "Visits and prescriptions in under 10 minutes for any basic illnesses. Fantastic every time I've used it!",
        "I really liked knowing that I did not have to go out to the doctors office. It would have been very difficult for me. The app worked perfectly.",
        "It went very well. Easy to use. My doctor was nice. Quicker than going to an urgent care location. I will definitely be using this in the future.",
        "Fast, easy, less expensive and safe.",
        "Great way to see a dr. With out haveing to leave home. Very convenient.",
        "Awesome and quick. Was able to do at work in a few minutes. No need to wait at urgent care later for ear ache",
        "Photos wouldn't upload but otherwise everything was great.",
        "Psychiatrist can only \"do\" medication management. How can anyone \"do\" med management without your records or psychiatric work up. If you just want a bunch of Xanax, this is the place. If you need a help or are trying to determine what you should do for a loved one, this is not the place. Shame on you bcbs.",
        "Easy to use and very helpful!",
        "Excellent option to see a doctor virtually, especially when you don't feel well!",
        "So fast & easy to use!",
        "Easy to use and fast",
        "Very nice, easy to use.",
        "Convenient, worked great for me",
        "very easy to use. great experience",
        "Great experience with real doctors!",
        "The online visit was awesome.",
        "This was the easiest thing I've ever done.",
        "Wonderful way to see a doctor in pajamas .",
        "My physician was extremely nice and helpful",
        "Took a while to connect with the doctor. The appointment was really rushed and I was prescribed a medicine that didn't make sense. I called customer support to try to get info on why I was prescribed the certain medicine and was told I had to \"take it or leave it or call a different doctor\". Tried calling a different physician and the physician declined my call. I would rather go to ready care.",
        "Was a fine experience",
        "Works great. Easy",
        "DR. SARAH ANNE SCHUMANN WAS SO KIND,,,,,AND SHE PROBABLY SAVED MY LIFE,,,,, SHE WAS VERY INTERESTED TO WHAT I KNEW,,,,, AND SHE LISTENED TO ME WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I RESPECTED HER VERY MUCH,,,,, THANK YOU DOCTOR AND THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN,,,,,,,,",
        "Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting. You'll have to re-log back in again although the info. you previously entered will still be there to copy over.",
        "I used it for the first time tonight, so glad I found it. Simple sinus infection which I'm prone to. Was able to get script for antibiotics without having to go to urgent care. More importantly...my visit cost $10 instead of $75. :) My only issue is the pharmacy locator map is off, so I had to hunt my pharmacy down. It showed my pharmacy being a mile south of where it actually is, with other pharmacies around it, that aren't there either. :(",
        "I love the convenience and ease of using. Had too use again and had a Dr from my home state, Dr Drew provided a detailed explanation and was very helpful",
        "I am impressed with this app. First of all, it is very easy to use. They have made it so comprehensive that a child could walk through it. Second, the wait time is way shorter than going to the doctor's office, urgent care, and ESPECIALLY the emergency room. I've used this app twice so far and my longest wait time has been 2 minutes! Last but not least, the doctor who I saw on both occasions has been very professional and courteous. She listened to my concerns and helped me as needed. I'm happy",
        "Corona makes for a long waiting room. Also app doesn't work well in the back ground. Gotta sit in waiting room with no phone,or take the chance on loosing a place on the waiting list. I think it would be a better experience if it worked in the back ground and had some kind of sound to wake you if you fall asleep in waiting room. I did it 3 times.\ud83e\udd2b",
        "I had to register since this was my first time using online services. That was easy. There were 2 patients ahead of me. I did not try to do other things on my phone while in the waiting room. I waited 20 minutes, saw the doctor, and was done. Fast, easy, waited what I felt was a very reasonable period of time, considering it's not a set appointment and I imagine many are taking advantage of this service now with the shelter in place order in effect. I will use this again.",
        "Doctor says picture quality wasn't great. She was able to assist me but why is my video quality poor with a Note 10 plus? No other issues.",
        "Excellent - an easy to navigate app, first-time user with no issues setting up appt./insurance/pharmacy info and getting right in to the 'waiting room' for a pediatrician. The doctor was friendly and asked everything I'd have expected to make a diagnosis by screens. This will be fabulous for those URI/flu visits, to get through that, \"let it run its course\" stage of illness that I'd know would be coming even if I went in to a brick/mortar for vitals.",
        "It was much easier than I thought I would be. I was able to select from several doctors and see their ratings. The app allows for you to cancel before the doctor comes on which is great. Glad I didnt cancel because the doctor was also able to send prescription in to my pharmacy too.",
        "Love this application, didn't even have to leave my couch :-) it was quick and easy to use and was much better than being sick and going to the doctor's office or Urgent Care. The whole experience took about 10 to 15 minutes and my scripts will be ready in an hour. I think this is awesome!",
        "A waste of my time and money. I was charged $49 for them to tell me to take my teen to an urgent care. No disclaimers about what they would or would not treat for a kid. If my child was over 18 they could have been treated, but since they were only 16 they had to charge me to tell me go to a doctor. Waste of time and money. I will update the rating if I get a refund.",
        "The wait was normal for it saying 7 people ahead of me it didn't take hours it was more like an hour so I would say the app worked perfect the Dr. Was great! And he prescribed. Medicine for my problem and it was over . After that he gave me some follow directions and what to do if it got worse and to check up with my PCP no matter what, and if the medicine didnt help to check on it being maybe an abscyst or something else he was emailing me everything we talked about etc. So no complaints!!",
        "First time using it this morning. I'm prone to sinus infections and knew I had one so didn't wanna go to the doctor. It only cost me $10 total. The doctor was efficient and quick. I hardly had to wait. It was definitely different but that's so much quicker and easier and cheaper than going to the doctor! Great for these small things like this! My dad told me to check it out instead of having to try to get into the doctor and so so glad he did. Didn't even have to get dressed. A+ work BCBS!"
