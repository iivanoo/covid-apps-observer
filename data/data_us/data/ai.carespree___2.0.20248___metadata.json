        "The COVID questionnaire was very helpful. Thank you!",
        "Quick and painless, although a little buggy. Sometimes it struggles to sign me in, and when I try to save a doctor's note it just crashes. Otherwise incredibly helpful, especially now.",
        "It will not allow me to get any info over to my work. Will not allow me to download my doctor visit information to my phone or fax it to my work or email to my HR department.",
        "I have to answer the same questions every time I log in. It doesn't pick up where we left off.",
        "Keeps going back to main menu, no matter if I try to link it and login with my Sydney health info or try making a new account. There is no in-app chat or trouble shooting. Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this\"resource\" multiple times. I have a doctorate, and my husband literally writes computer code for a living so this is not user error. If he and I can't figure out how to make it work, it just doesn't work.",
        "What a joke. Sent me to another app for video doctor visit. What was the point of this app. It just told me what I already knew that I needed to get tested and to use another app to video chat with a Dr.",
        "Login Fails every time. Cleared cache, then uninstalled to no avail.",
        "App crashes more than all Nascar drivers together. Cant even download an attachment referral. Also have to sign in 8 times just to send one message because it crashes then requires login credentials. Fought with this app for 60 min before I told the doctor to just cancel everything we discussed and I was uninstalling this piece of trash crash app.",
        "This application is very interactive for symptom check. Only issue my grandma found is she was not able to login back with her finger print after logging out. She was so keen about it because she did not want to remember her credentials.",
        "This app doesn't work at all. Can't even get past the login. The app just shuts down/closes without warning or continually brings you back to the login page. In my time of need this was a huge waste of my time.",
        "Absolute garbage, slow, freezes, crashes, won't let you actually download attachments without crashing, can't actually print them either. Tried on a stock Android phone (Pixel 2XL) and a Samsung Galaxy S8.",
        "The front is so big (which i like) and there are many questions with multiple choice answers, I was not able to scroll to the first options to read or select them. This app was useless to me and I had to delete it.",
        "Seems buggy It worked fine for few days then stopped working. Reloaded changed password still getting era message.",
        "Initially, I had issues with the app crashing. I read the reviews and saw the developer's feedback that this known issue has been resolved in latest version. So I downloaded the latest version and everything works smoothly. The app has a Coronavirus assessment which is very timely and useful. Pretty cool. You can even chat with a doc. I'll start with this app next time I'm thinking about going to see a doctor.",
        "The world really needs this right now. They have a covid assessment based on Cdc.im impressed. Yeah it was buggy at first but I noticed the developers are updating this app quite often, probably attempting to fix bugs and making healthcare available to people at home. Yeah the wait times could be long but it's better than waiting at the hospital with a ton of other people not practicing social distancing. I got to chat with a doctor and it's good to have doctor advice at this time. Keep it up",
        "Took forever to set up. Very slow and kept kicking me out of the app set up. Then refused to recognize my login information, which I verified was correct. Was able to actually get into the app 2 times, because I had a lot of time to keep retrying. If I were actually sick, I'd probably be dead by the time the app recognized me.",
        "Trying to setup, sends code to email for verification. When retrieving code from. Email, and returning to app to enter it, app resets, and make you start over, which causes a new code to be generated. When go to retrieve it, the app resets again. Infinite loop, waste of time. Does anyone test this stuff. Terrible. Issue isn't the delay, (although there is a delay), the issue is having to switch to email to get the code. It appears that switching process is causing the reset when you return.",
        "The app freezes my phone. It's worse than nothing! Update on 3/21/2020. At your suggestion I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same thing. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+. It still freezes my phone immediately when I click the icon. Blue screen. Nothing else. I never get to the point where I can answer questions.",
        "Anthem emailed me to have me sign up for this to \"assess\" my \"COVID-19 symptoms\". First attempt at registering, it hangs at password entry. Tried a dozen times, gave up, and tried several hours later. Now I just never even receive a 1-time code to progress far enough to enter a password. Maybe don't push your app on people until you get the infrastructure in place to support the surge?",
        "Started good then waited 4.5 hours in virtual waiting room to video meet with doctor....which I was very understanding due to the Coronavirus. When I finally was First In Line, the screen went blank, I received 4 text messages at the same time...,3 said a physician was reviewing my chart, and last one said the reviewing physician was transferring me to another physician. I logged back in and had to start all over again waiting in line. I am so frustrated I wasted 4.5 hours...not exaggerating!",
        "I installed on my Google Pixel 2 and never received the verification code. Clicked on resend. I got a code in my spam mail, entered it, and got an invalid code message. I deleted the app, reinstalled, and tried again. I was sent another code, entered it, and just kept getting a \"verifying\" message until it timed out. I am not sure what the problem is (it could just be demand), but it is not worth trying right now.",
        "Impossible to use, this app crashes right when you get to the section that asks you questions. I've tried two different devices with the same result on each. Update, the related issue was fixed so I've updated my rating. This app still needs a better user experience, so 3 stars now.",
        "Dumb app does not work!! You can not get passed the login!",
        "The app crashed three times while I was waiting to chat with a Dr. It took over two hours to basically be told they couldn't help anyways.",
        "I will give it 0 stars if I could! I did #16 in line after 3+ hours waiting and signing in 6+ times I made it all the way to #1 in line. Only to get kick out of the app and have to sign in again and was back to #13 in line! This app is a joke!",
        "As others have said I've never had an app make me so F------ mad! I've also tried every way you can imagine and can't get in. There is never a code sent. I if so where is it? This app sucks! I'll be glad to remove it.",
        "This app sucks I can't even log in...I enter a password and it says my password cannot be my username or part of my username or email even though my password is not!",
        "Wow.. waited all weekend to use this app this morning to Verify I have Coronavirus so I can FINALLY get seen and its stuck on verification code. Doesn't send code to email. Really. Fix this as local hospitals are tiny and need this as a screening tool.",
        "I loved this app when it worked! Now it keeps crashing. Every time I open it, it freezes and nothing shows up. I tried to see if there was an update but there's not :(",
        "Super unresponsive and slow. Useless. I never got to the point where I could finish setting up my password. I gave up. Good luck and find a better app for symptoms.",
        "Lets use the same login info as the Sydney app? Username/password since it doesn't work like this (logged into Sydney app but the exact same info doesn't work) it might be useful but who knows if you can't login.",
        "This app is great. I had a fever and was able to see my doctor from home the same day. My doctors office just got so much better, no more waiting rooms",
        "This app is completely worthless - it won't even send me a verification code to get it work - Anthem will hear about this - I would give it zero stars if I could - glad I'm not sick!",
        "Good luck. Can't get past setting up an account as it continues to drop out of the verify page before the code gets through. Twice.",
        "Nice way to obtain health concern with an MD :)",
        "I know it not a real diagnose. But at least you can get a sense of what condition you have.. So thank you. Its a really good app..",
        "This app is great for pointing you on the direction you should go regarding symptoms.",
        "The app never sent the security code to my email address; so I wasn't able to progress through to the assessment. Disappointing.",
        "It's doesn't work, it takes too long to get the access, then the code is expired once it's received. I'm uninstalling app.",
        "The experience was good except it kept logging me out when trying to text with the doctor. Please fix that."
