        "I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.",
        "Waiting room \"interview \" outside of this app was confusing because it appeared to be a duplicate, not on the device I had my appointment set for.",
        "Great application, very easy process, friendly and professional staff. Would absolutely recommend and use again",
        "Great App so far, clear picture & sound with no echo or pause !!!",
        "Used it twice in the beginning of the pandemic and in November, both were positive interactions.",
        "Easy to use and friendly physicians, but you can't use non-IU health plans, so I have to pay $60 per visit.",
        "The visits are wonderful. The wait time is loooooonnnnnggggg. And the app kept putting people in front of me while I waited.",
        "No record of visit, not linked to rest of health record. Have had 2 appointments (one for me and one for my child). Neither appointment exist in my app history. When I log into my Health Portal, these visits don't show. During my visit yesterday the nurse practitioner stated they were transferring prescriptions to my pharmacy. My pharmacy doesn't have them and there is no way to verify the appointment even occurred.",
        "Easier then driving to my doctor, paying for parking, walking through the building, up to the office, waiting to be seen, checking out and driving home. Love it.",
        "Clear, good connection quality, well organized, and good service.",
        "In a season where Covid-19 has changed how we live our lives seeing Doctor Knutson virtually is awesome. Being that I am immunodeficiencent these virtual appointments removes the stress from my life. I highly recommend this to everyone.",

        "Great, except volume too low for hard of hearing.",
        "Very easy and convenient. Very professional service.",
        "First time using this and was very impressed with the clarity and sound! 21st Century Rocks!!",
