    "description": "WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.\r\n\r\nYour voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nHow WA Notify works:\r\nWhen devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nApple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.\r\n\r\nHow WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:\r\nWashington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.\r\n\r\nState law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.\r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!",

        "Horrible way to track if you were exposed I allowed all it's permissions & never notified even when I knew I'd been exposed or working on a facility under then current virus lockdown. It failed so badly that had to rely on \"non ISP\" means of tracking exposure & being tested over & over. FAILURE of an app. I'd give it zero stars if I could",
        "DISSAPOINTINGLY USELESS. I'm very supportive of this app in theory, but it's basically rendered entirely useless when users cannot self-report, when many positive users can't get a code, and even if they are called by the health dept you have to ask for one, they don't automatically offer a code or recommend this app. To take the cake, many users report multiple state health staff having NO IDEA about such code when asked about it. So sad, this app could have been so useful.",
        "At this time I'm giving WA Notify 2 stars. I'm not understanding why the \"Record of recent check-ins for possible exposure\" is only being checked one to three times daily. And most of the \"check-ins\" are when I'm at home, I rarely see that there are any check-ins while I'm in public\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I feel it is important for us to have an app like this, but if the app is not checking for exposures while I'm out of my home then it seems almost useless. I'll change my review once I see a change in the app.",
        "Helpful tool to flatten the curve until Vaccines control the spread of COVID-19. Thank-you to the Developers and those involved in getting this to end-users.",
        "I got zero alerts about someone getting Covid-19, even though Washington still has Covid-19 cases and it drains my battery because I have to always have bluetooth and location mode on at all times for it to work. Wasted potential",
        "Keeps me abreast of WA covid news and gets my post-vaccination input. Secure and trusted, makes me part of the tracking solution.",
        "So this app is in violation of countless admendent right not to mention the Patriot act. This is B's. Hells to the mother tucking no. You want permission to override my phone making it impossible for an insurance claim. Only if your gonna be paying me outright for the brand new Samsung or iPhone largest category in their new line each time they come out.",
        "This app got lots of publicity, but never actually did anything. I also love that the WA Dept of Health asked you to sign up for vaccine eligibility notifications through their phase finder tool... But they simply took it down the last week of March, right around when it sounded like vaccines were being opened up to everyone.",
        "The second you turn Bluetooth off it annoys the hell out of you to turn it back on. There needs to be functionality that addresses this gap as people will discontinue use due to the annoyance. Reading the reviews here does not give me confidence that positive cases are being captured properly (even if the person tests positive and gets a verification code by doh) due to the delay from the point they positive test, to them talking to DOH WA to get the code. 2 days to weeks, to possibly never.",
        "I'm about to uninstall. I'm not going to keep BT on 24/7 and I am fully aware that when it is off I can't get warnings. I'm at home 99.9% of the time. The app used to let me clear the notification but recently left the notification posted full time even after acknowledging. Annoying people isn't the way to get them to adopt.",
        "Got notified today of a possible exposure from last week. I could figure out where I was since I had the date, and go get tested immediately. I wish the app said you SHOULD get tested not only if you have symptoms as the testing center wasn't sure if I met testing criteria. But glad I had the app installed if I can prevent further spread.",
        "2021-03-07 Update fixed. 5 stars! {App worked as expected for the first 2 months, however this morning I see a notice that I need to have location turned on as well as bluetooth. This is unnerving seeing that the app settings on my phone show no permissions are in use. I have android 6 but this same concern is being voiced by an android 9 user here in the comments. This behaviour is new and as I can only toggle location globally on my device.}",
        "I have covid 19 and this app is a joke dont download it ever it does not work",
        "Quick and easy to use",
        "The Bluetooth notification is annoying. I'm at home most of the time and am not going to have Bluetooth on all the time.",
        "No notification but definitely have been exposed to known covid cases. Does this even do anything.",
        "Will this WA Notify app works within Washington state only? or does it works in other state too? I recently flew to CA and I don't see anything happen to this app yet.",
        "Deleting off phone. Why have an app to notify or be notified of a positive when I was not given a code. Almost pointless in conservative part of Washington.",
        "Do not install doesnt work, the 5 star reviews are botted",
        "I like the idea that it gives you a heads up if you contact and/or get near a person tested positive for COVID-19.",
        "My husband has covid and it still says I do not have a exposure... Been almost a week now..... So zero faith in this app",
        "Never had any notifications whatsoever. This has been useless to me. It appears that the state also has not done any contact tracing since I have never gotten here or even in a news release any information about who; what groups, profiles, age groups, have gotten ill in order for me to make decisions about my relative safety. I suspect this app was just a state sponsored experiment to track my movements and associates.",
        "Pretty much useless ... depends on folks universally installing and reporting and since that does not happen ... useless ... and tells us based on our locations only after the fact ... if someone who tested positive was in our vicinity ... would be more useful if it gave real time alerts with a Pic of who to avoid ... but no ... that would work... but might offend someone's sense of rights ... idiotic perspective.... lack of real time capacity ...lack of ability to self report. . Lack of unive",
        "Used for about a year with no real negatives. However I would PLEASE ask the ability to turn off Bluetooth without constantly getting warned it's off. If I'm going to spend all day at home by myself, I can save battery by not having BT on. I'll turn it back on . Monday morning.",
        "Lots of fun. Get lost and enjoy!",
        "After being vaccinated I feel like a milestone was reached allowing me to uninstall this. I hope we never have to use this again, but I'm glad this excellent approach is available for us.",
        "This app was a good idea, but there wasn't much thought put into the development of it. There is no way to enter a positive result or exposure without a verification code. This makes the app entirely pointless since I know of nine positive results with no phone calls being dodged, just no way to get a code. This seems like a pretty big oversight.",
        "I do not need constant notifications that my bluetooth is off - it drains my battery, so I only turn it on when I'm at risk of exposure, which is not often. There needs to be on option to turn that notification off, because it's so irritating that I'm on the verge of uninstalling this app, which kind of defeats its purpose, don't you think?",
        "Nice concept, but poor execution on letting the public know it is available, and letting them know how the app works and what safeguards are in place to protect their privacy. To many people think the app will share personal information, so are unwilling to download it. This is making the app unusable as it was designed to be used. If only one person out of a hundred has downloaded it and is using it, then what use is having it on your phone?",
        "I tested positive and the app wouldn't let me notify people. It turns out the app needs a code, given by Washington State department of health employees when they call you for a phone survey/interview. I received positive test results on Sunday 1/17 and received a phone call follow up on Tuesday 1/19. I brought up the code and was given it, but that was only after the entire call was completed with no mention of the code or app. If I hadn't brought it up it would not have come up otherwise.",
        "Too soon to tell but could be very useful. They need to have a share that you can choose which app store to refer people Apple or Google. This one just sends a Google link which is useless for my wife and daughter. Hopefully they will add this. The real key is getting enough people to use it in this paranoid, conspiracy following world. Thanks for the quick response and good luck!",
        "Okay in theory, does not work whatsoever in reality. I've been a covid tester numerous times and a first responder around confirmed covid positive patients. The app never alerted once while I've had it on my phone the last several months. Bluetooth and GPS is always on. Battery saver always off.",
        "Wouldn't let me give my negative result. Wasn't anything good",
        "The concept is fine but the fact that we are relying on someone who has the virus to input a code that no one seems to know about makes this app pretty useless. The last year has proven to us that we cannot rely on people to do the right thing so that makes this app double useless. This would have been far more useful if it kept the bluetooth device pinging but used every device's phone number and compared it against a database of known infected person's phone numbers.",
        "Won't allow you to turn on Exposure Notifications. I Uninstaller, and reinstalled app. Still won't allow me to turn on exposure notifications. I get an error message \"something went wrong. Please try again\" any suggestions? I uninstalled and now when I try to reinstall I get the something went wrong message. Garbage",
        "Excellent Application keeps you informed of your safety while interacting with public and friends and stranger's.",
        "I received a call 8 hours after doing a Covid test and was told I was positive but no one knew about the verification code for this app. This app is pointless if not all hospitals to include the military know how to use it or know how to provide the access code. It needs to be more user friendly.",
        "Constantly alerts if you ever have gps or bluetooth off so if it ever tries to give me a virus alert, I won't notice it. Update: I don't care about data or battery. I turn things off because I don't want internet dog food ads for driving past a pet store and I only go out once a week for groceries; no guests.",
        "I received a notification that I was exposed on a day where I had kept my phone in a space not shared with others (no shared wall, etc), as I do every work day. In other words, no one spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of my phone. It is a healthcare facility, so there is little doubt the \"exposure\" was generated here, but it seems that either the location sharing probably far exceeds 6 feet, or is far less than 15 minutes in order for me to be alerted to exposure.",
        "This app is a waste of time it doesn't actually help you get notified when you've been around someone who has had covid!"
