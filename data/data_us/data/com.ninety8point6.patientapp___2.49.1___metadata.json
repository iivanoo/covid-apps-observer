        "Problem solved - great service, great support! App needs to tell you if your subscription is recurring/non-recurring to avoid confusion! As an aside, I appreciate the enthusiasm from 98's tech support, but I'd rather not receive unsolicited phonecalls - even in an attempt to help resolve issues.",
        "I'd heard mixed things about this app/service, but I really like it! It makes it easy to see a provider whenever I like, and the doctors and practitioners I've worked with so far have been attentive to what I needed as well as kind and polite. I'm definitely going to keep using this app/service!",
        "Horrific experience. I filled out the application and once I got connected (after almost and hour) the doctor said he couldn't help without a single question asked. We won't use it again.",
        "Needed to speak with a doctor at 6am on a Sunday in the US for some gastro advice (good luck anywhere other than a hospital or urgent care). Absolutely loved the service I received my physician was as helpful as possible, given that we were essentially just chatting. This service isn't gonna cure some random illness you've had for years but it certainly fills a gap when you have important questions that need to be answered in short order and you don't wanna pay a $100+ dollars just to ask them.",
        "This app has helped me so much expecailly being a mom of four kids under the age of 10 getting to a doctor is very hard. They make sure to ask clarifying questions and address all your issues",
        "Absolutely have had great service that is fast easy and thorough! I've used several times and this is the first place I will go with questions and concerns!",
        "Very easy to use and very helpful! I was able to send pics thru the app and get the meds I need. Definitely will use again!",
        "Quick, insightful help! I was in a lot of pain and was so grateful to get an appointment from my house instead of traveling in pain.",
        "This app is amazing. Its Easter weekend and everything is closed and here I am with an abscessed tooth! Antibiotics are on their way to a pharmacy near me!",
        "Quick and Easy. Prescription filled within minutes. Doctor Andrew Le was very professional and helpful. App is easy to use.",
        "The doctors that treated me were very kind and helpful. They answered all my questions and the app was super easy and convenient.",
        "Doctors won't order regular check up or lab work if you ask for. They will tell you to go for an in person consultation. Also it's only for adults, if you have children, they won't help you.",
        "The app is so easy to use and the doctor's response time was extremely quick!",
        "I'm so glad my dad introduced me to this app - since I lost my job to covid, it's been so rough without insurance but this is affordable and I can get my prescriptions refilled easily. Heck, I feel like the doctors I talk to via chat here listen to my concerns more than any in-person visit I've had!",
        "The app has been great for me as my anxiety causes me to skip appointments or undervalue my care needs. Now I feel that I can get a quick assessment and medication without having to wait at an urgent care and can take care of my other commitments.",
        "App works really well but is a waste of time. Dr wouldn't answer any of my questions and told me to go see a Dr. I can't really complain though. I guess you get what you pay for.",
        "This is supposed to be text-based. I logged in to try and get care for a simple issue. I got as far as entering my name and phone number before the on-screen guidance asked if a video chat was ok. The options were Yes or End Visit. This is a bogus program.",
        "I received terrible customer service from the 98point6 doctors during virtual visits on several occasions. They rushed through the visits, didn't listen to me or give me time to explain my heathcote concerns or needs. Their doctors ended the visits abruptly and signed out of the app before I could even finish asking them questions. Highly DO NOT recommend this app!",
        "The doctors are very educated and try to help as much as they can over the phone. It's super simple, you sign up, pay for the subscription (mine was $30 for 3 months) and then you just need to fill out a symptom questionnaire and the doctor will confirm your name and date of birth in video call and return back to the chat in text to help you out. They were able to prescribe me a prescription at my closest pharmacy. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
        "My wait time was only 2 minutes and the doctor was very attentive and asked the right questions and allow me to share what normally works best for me! It was a very pleasant experience and it took no time at all to get the help I needed!",
        "Takes a couple minutes to get through all the basic questions but its a great bridge and time saver especially on the weekends.",
        "The doctor I spoke with was very helpful and nice. The app is really easy to navigate. Definitely will continue using",
        "I have had the opportunity to use this app a couple of times. It's great being able to speak with a doctor instead of spending all day waiting in an office.",
        "Just great. Finally, something in life that is easy and just works as you'd expect... actually, even better.",
        "Easy to use, quick and convenient for general medical care. Text based symptom reporting and conversation with providers.",
        "Great idea that is executed well. Helped me out of a primary provider jam and got my prescriptions and labs taken care of. Highly recommend.",
        "Very easy and quick, the Doctor was knowledgeable and we were able to get my daughter on a prescription right away",
        "I love being able to discuss symptoms with a Dr and they can help me with figuring out home remedies or if we need a trip to a Dr in person. I feel very confident in the advice they give me. It's a free service through my insurance and I really appreciate it!",
        "Quick, easy, professional. Great for little nagging issues that aren't bad enough to schedule an actual doctor visit for.",
        "Excellent experience! Doctor helps you step by step. Would recommend this app who's insurance allows it.",
        "Super easy to get some peace of mind from the Search Engine at home doctor results my brain was racing through.",
        "This has been an amazing resource. Have not had a bad experience and have used it twice. Great.",
        "Easy to use. Perfect to meet my schedule needs and each doctor has provided amazing patient skills.",
        "What's the point of getting charged $40 for a \"visit\" that's just the doctor telling me I'll need to see a doctor in person? If I could see a doctor in person, I wouldn't be using an app like this in the first place.",
        "Fairly agreeable app, I've not had trouble in the two times I've used it.",
        "I was so against these types of things, but my company got it for us. I have had a string of bad luck and have had to use this app twice in less than a week. It has been amazing, very fast, people always polite. It helps if you know a little bit about what's going on with you. I would definitely recommend this app,it has been a much appreciated option.",
        "So far, I've had ONLY good experiences using this app. It's super easy to use and safer and more efficient than venturing into a clinic for things that can just as easily be diagnosed via text and photo communication.",
        "I was skeptical of using this service at first. But when my Dr told me I had to wait till March to see him, I gave it a shot. Got an appointment within minutes. It was a nice hybrid text/video appt and very convenient. I needed a follow up to release back to work and that was done through text with the same Dr as before within 20 min start to finish. Will definitely use again",
        "This app almost seems to good to be true. Been using it a year now. Visit a doctor anytime, from anywhere for a dollar a visit (plus $120 annual fee) App works great and the doctors really listen. I love being able to talk to a doctor over chat. I don't have to worry about setting up a webcam, or family members overhearing the visit. Not a full replacement for an in person doctor, but for things that can be diagnosed remotely it's more convenient, and less stressful than going in person.",
        "The first time i used this app was great...after that it was useless.. The drs didnt want to do anything to help me and suggested i go to a dr... I have no insurance and my normal dr is a low income clinic that takes months to get an appt at... And i cant afford an er visit each time i need a medication refilled... And it wasnt even a narcotic medication or anything along those lines... So whats the point of this app??"
