    "description": "Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. \r\n\r\nDesigned by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. \r\n\r\nIn these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNote that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.\r\n\r\nWe do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\r\n\r\nThis temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. \r\n\r\nFor more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/",

        "Can't activate app. On the \"let's get started\" page, I enter 2 demographic info and click on submit. The app says something went wrong and to resubmit later.",
        "Cannot read the privacy statement because it won't load. Cannot add my daily temp because it shows error. Get your act together JHU. 0ne star is too much. Maybe one of your engineers can developed a usable/workable app.",
        "I cannot enter any data to start my profile. I keep getting an error that something went wrong.",
        "I cannot enter data. When I tap the input box, the keyboard does not appear.",
        "Latest version is broken. It used to work, but now it tells me I am offline All the time Android",
        "Unable to input to register and participate",
        "Errors. Will not pass age on pixel 2",
        "I had an earlier version that partially worked (could submit data but couldn't tell if it actually submitted because the counter didn't show how many days I submitted) and I couldn't edit my profile. New version clean install won't accept any profile data. Just tells me that there was a problem and to try again.",
        "Extremely easy app. I appreciate the daily reminders. I shared this information on my Facebook and have been telling folks that I interact with. Thank you Johns Hopkins for playing a vital role in tracking this virus.",
        "utterly useless failed to allow submission of data from 1st screen",
        "The temperature starts at 97, mine is 96.3. After I put it in as 97, I kept getting notices to input my temperature. So, I am deleting the app.",
        "Keeps telling me to enter my daily information everytime phone is turned on even though I already entered it for today. Uninstalling it now.",
        "Super easy to use and convenient. The maps are interesting",
        "interesting ...as a first responder, glad you re doing this!",
        "Important in the fight to defeat COVID 19"
