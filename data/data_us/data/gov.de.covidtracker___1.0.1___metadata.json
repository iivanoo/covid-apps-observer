        "Simple interface, good execution. Should be simple enough for less-than-tech-savy people. Very good idea making it Bluetooth only; I can recommend this to others with peace of mind in terms of privacy. It doesn't even ask for other permissions! All around great job. If you have criticisms, please send it to there feedback department. Don't just rate the app low because you're having trouble with it. You're just hurting the reach of the app, and we need this to be widespread to work.",
        "Would like to use the app, but the app always hangs when I get to the data page and click on Continue. I' using a Pixel 3 phone, Android 11.",
        "The app needs to be updated as it still talks about 14 days of isilatio. I'm not sure what phase 2 is as we are now at alert level 1",
        "My only suggestion is adding daily reminder notifications to check in.",
        "Super easy to use.",
        "I don't think I have the virus, but I think it's allergy. I do have the symptoms mentioned but have had them for along time (not14days). Question what are the symptoms for animals(cats&dogs) I can not stop them from itching, coughing, feeling slightly bad",
        "I'm from Maryland but travel to Delaware frequently. This app only works on one of my phone, the others are too old. Please expand the API to include phones down to 4.4. Also less than 100 installs (50+) indicates no one is using it at the time of review. This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less. For this type of app to be meaningful, you need to have engagement > 50% of the population or >500,000% more installs.",
        "Don't be so pushy with government tracking apps directly to home-screen. You'll damage already fragile trust in government. 1 star for nanny-ishness. Slap your foreheads. Bad, engineers, bad. No treat for you.",
        "Wow makes you turn on bluetooth and is a complete invasion of privacy. Stay home and hide if you are scared of COVID",
        "Perpetually stuck waiting for download from Play Store.",
        "What a great idea. At least someone is thinking!",
        "Because Covid-19 is bad, mkay.",
        "Wish it would remind me to enter daily data. And with 35,000 users and only 180 check-ins a day I assume that feature would help others too."
