        "Of course it is a wait time but they are always wonderful just like the visits when you go in tge office!! I love my pediatric associates!!!!",
        "Easy to use & very nice layout!! Better than potentially being exposed to Covid too!! \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Quick and easy! No more waiting for appointments and no need to worry about getting to a location on time. The doctor I spoke to with my daughter was very helpful, patient and took her health extremely seriously! I DEFINITELY recommend this app to parents to use at all times, Day and Night!!!",
        "I like this app because 2 things mainly. One is the possibility to see credentials and waiting time for the providers and two, because you can submit pictures or any other information you want the doctor to review.",
        "Amazing service and doctors 24/7 at the comfort of your own home. Without having to wait for hours in a doctors office. I love it.",
        "The best app to get help for my babies any time. Faster than emergency room to get scripts or real certified answers that works (grandma knowledge)... If not life threatening... Always call 911.",
        "Super helpful didn't have to drive to get my baby to the doctor. They took care of everything over the phone.",
        "Literally like a virtual home visit from a doctor. Cannot recommend this app enough. 10/10 we will use this again.",
        "Excellent attention for not being in person. I love the possibilities",
        "Clear connection and its easy saves alot of time.",
        "This was very efficient . I was very relieved with having a doctors visit so fast",
        "NP Rachel B very pleasant and took the time and answered all my questions. She rocks\ud83c\udfb8",
        "Love this app! It is so easy, fast and convenient! Doctor's and nurses are incredibly friendly and nice and make the visit extra convenient and helpful. Being a mom of 3 the last thing i want to do is go to the doctor's office with all of them. The visit is the same and faster! Great app! Thank you!",
        "So convenient and easy!",
        "Loved my experience, few minutes of talking with the associate and a few instruction to check on my child and we got some tips to follow all while avoiding driving to the Dr.'s office. Feel very cared for as my need was met. Thank you Pediatric Associates. 10/16/20 update: Still love the experience. Happy to be so well cared for. Thank you!",
        "Provider was informative and attentive. Wait time was better than office visit wait time.",
        "I just love the interaction with the kids and the Doctor!! Dr.Gabriel Entemen BECKER Is The Greatest!!",
        "Easy and fast",
        "Quick. And awesome to use. Thanks",
        "Great during these tough times",
        "It is very convenient. It's not for every health problem, but it helps for some that would not require a trip to the office. The doctors and nurse practitioners are very professional and compassionate. It's fast, and easy to use. The patient its seen by the doctor in a matter of a few minutes. I love this option.",
        "I absolutely LOVE this app! It has made our lives and treating our children so convenient. The app is very easy to use and I can chose one of the many doctors or practioners available. 5 stars.",
        "Really good and convince",
        "The Dr. We saw was very knowledgeable and nice.",
        "More convenient dont have to wait at the doctor office",
        "Very resourceful! Doctor was very nice and professional. The visit was fast and I got the prescription I needed for my daughter without having to physically go to an office.",
        "Simple, and quick to get access to a doctor especially at 10pm. Doctor was very nice & helpful . during times like this i appreciate doctors that take the time out of their day to treat kids via video . thank you !",
        "I absolutely LOVE this app! I'm so glad my children's pediatrician office offers telemedicine. It's so convenient to have a appointment with a provider from the comfort of my home. Being a working mom makes it difficult sometimes to get to the office on time with a sick child. So this a definitely a God sent. Also all of the telemedicine providers that I have seen are nice, patient (answering all of my questions), and thorough with diagnosis and treatmemt plans, and any needed prescriptions are electronically sent to your pharmacy.",
        "Convenient and u ser-friendly.",
        "To the person that came up with this app, thank you! This app makes everything so convenient especially if your child has just a minor cold, non-emergency type of situation, etc that does not require him/her to actually come into the doctor's office to be seen in person. The best part about this app is that it is apple/android compatible and so simple to use. Very user-friendly. We had the pleasure of having Dr. Berkovich during this consultation and she was so professional AND personable. \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc4d",
        "This is very convenient to use and the doctor answered all of my questions. I was very happy with this option. It saves everyone a trip too!",
        "Cool and convenient. Late at night, my ds starting having coughing fits and I didn't realize his medication had run out. I called the pharmacy and they said that his prescription had expired. I was able to log on KidzDocNow and schedule an appointment to video chat with the medical staff. She heard my concerns and read his file. She was then able to send his prescription to the 24hr pharmacy. I didn't have to wait until the doctor's office opened. Love this app!",
        "This was a life saver! I couldn't get to the pediatrician office when my daughter had a bump that became infected over night. I was able to talk to a pediatrician with the app & was able to get a antibiotic to CVS to help her. I am so thankful to this app. The only thing that happened was we got disconnected for a minute but it came right back up & we finished.",
        "I totally love this app. I was able to see the nurse and discuss/show my child's issue in the privacy of my own home without waking or hauling my other children into the doctor's office. I'm so glad that this app is available now as it saves busy moms a lot of time. Thank you.",
        "Needs a lot of improvements. I'll rate it again later on but right now needs work. It has a mayor issue with the login screen where the mask it use to hide the remembered email results in a wrong email or password message if you don't delete and write everything. It becomes a hassle specially when you're in a hurry because the appointment is about to begin and you have to upload pictures and everything. Please check the login experience there is better technologies available right now.",
        "The app was wonderful. The doctor was very punctual, even being early by a couple of minutes. They even give you a call 10 minutea before your appointment to remind you to complete the uploads and be in the waiting room. The Camera was clear and the audio was also clear. though the Doctor said the audio on my side wasnt picking up, i had to use headphones to assist. Overall wonderful App.",
        "Really great option for non-urgent medical consultations. We love being able to get piece of mind, even in the late night hours. You can video chat so you can show any marks, bumps, bruises, etc. We just love it. It fills a much needed gap between wondering anxiously and rushing to a doctor's office for every little thing.",
        "I love this app because it's convenient for my kids to see the doctor anytime their sick and have questions. And, the doctor is so helpful, and if prescription is needed the doctor send right to your pharmacist with no problem. It's a blessing to our family.",
        "This app is amazing.... 10 \u2b50 if I could for sure. This was the first time I've used it and it is late Saturday night and I was able to video chat with the doctor and upload pics. I am very satisfied with the service and way happy I didn't have to expose her to the emergency room right now\ud83d\ude0a Thank you\ud83d\ude4f",
        "Fast. Easy to use. You can speak to care provider face to face in the comfort of ur own home. I had a virtual visit with Dr. Hala Fakhre, Im a new mom and she took the time to explain and answer all my questions. My baby developed sticky eye and an issue with poop. She spoke clearly and was detailed. I will definantly follow directions and recommandations. I recommand this app to every parent or guardian. Trust me. It gives anyone pease of mind to know that someone is there help out in mins."
