        "content": "Install was easy, and the app just sits on my phone and I forget it's even on here. Hopefully more people start using it, as it doesn't seem to be intrusive or even a battery drain at all (at least on my phone) you will need to have Bluetooth turned on in order for this app to work, but it uses something called low energy Bluetooth, which is probably why it doesn't affect battery life. Overall good, simple app.",
