    "comments": [
        "I never had any issues with the app functionality but, it was not useful to me in any way. No alerts or information to help me stay informed or safe. It has not improved my life or proved to be a valuable tool during COVID-19 in any way.",
        "Easy to install and set up. Requires someone who is exposed to reach out to their health department and put in a provided code in order to notify others, so there's a reliance on all users doing their part for this to work.",
        "Worthless app. does not work. People close to me are now dying from Covid and this worthless app helped no one. It drains battery on bluetooth and that's all it does. I am however fully vaccinated. UNINSTALLED",
        "Great concept. How many users by state? How many users By county? How many users by town? I feel like I'm the only one using this app in my area. I do turn on Bluetooth when I leave my home. *For me the only useful part of this app is the info on stats. I wonder if they advertised this app along with V-SAFE (online app) and others, if more people would even know about this app and download it. That's the only way this app will work is if others know about it and download it.",
        "The app is really only useful if widely used. Much like the new Excelsior pass, if it's use is not mandated or widely used voluntarily, it is essentially useless.",
        "Lacking in functionality to inform users... Doesn't link outside the app to get additional up-to-date information and directives from government agencies.",
        "Uninstalling this app as it doesn't seem to actually be used by any NYC contact tracing group. When I tested positive for covid, neither of the two contact tracing officials brought it up or could give me a code to notify people I was in contact with. What was the point lol?",
        "The app is a great idea, but it's useless because no one is using it. It should be mandatory. I'll uninstall because it does not work with only 500K installs.",
        "More of a data analysis tool, but useful nonetheless to see what's happening.",
        "A potential tool if used by more people and information is honestly shared otherwise the charts provide are informative.",
        "Signed up but it has never activated an alert. Assuming that's a good thing.",
        "Accurate and easy to use",
        "This app is useless and doesn't work. I was positive for covid but it didn't notify my gf who also had the app. None of the Healthcare providers or health departments seem to know about this app.",
        "It's a well designed app and is useful even if only for a convenient way to keep an eye on the charts. Of course the fact that it's opt-in is a limitation, but I really don't understand the complaints on this. People are saying they've never gotten an exposure notification like it's a bad thing. Are you sick with covid-19? If not, then what is the complaint exactly? You want false alarms?",
        "The information was very helpful and more awareness about this new techology. Thanks!",
        "Invasive use of solicitation to user by recommending via notification outside of the app store. I should not be getting push notifications that override my settings for these to be unable to do so. Google and affiliates are invading users privacy by doing so.",
        "Could be good if more people used it. Unfortunately for my battery, I can't afford to have Bluetooth on all day so I pretty much can't use this app. Only when plugged I but I can't have it plugged in when I'm public so...",
        "Informative and keeps me up-to-date on my area and stage a New York",
        "App can be manipulated for false positives. After providing symptoms, it tells me unfortunately and I may have Covid-19, yet these symptoms are for a different diagnosis that someone like myself deals with due to other health reasons. So basically this app is not fool proof and cannot be taken seriously. I'm now uninstalling it and hope that no residue applications within the app has been left behind in my device as some apps do leave behind unwanted features. Use at your own discretion",
        "i dont understand why i cant change my country .When i opened the app it said that im in New York and that a have to choose where i live in new york and then when i tried to change there was only the option not in new york state. I want to know the cases in My country Bulgaria not in America rn.",
        "I have it installed. With such an allegedly important tool that could save life's it really is discouraging that it only relies 9n Bluetooth. Even a ping of data could provide enough location for triangular based location. Uninstalling, scientific based precautions will help. Not on a COB Job cell phone app, and also this is a lesson for the people of NY also. Common sense and caution will benefit not this. C",
        "Covid alert is a Great apt..",
        "Randomly popped up with a notification even though I'd never had it installed. Basically tricked me into installing based on the assumption that it was trying to warn me of a potential exposure.",
        "Caused 6 other apps to fail and stop working. Uninstalled from phone, but still getting this apps notifications when Bluetooth is disabled. Very disappointed. Not recommended.",
        "my bluetooth always on cause my wireless ear buds. I work in a clinic that does covid testing and people who have symptoms for covid. not 1 notification.",
        "Easy to use. I will check in on it everyday to report my health condition. I am healthy now. I am looking for a vaccination. I guess that's a different app.",
        "The app is well built and is sleek. Unfortunately it captured less than 1% of cases in New York because people are not using it. People are not willing to do the right thing even when their life depends on it.",
        "its a good app, but some times i receive alarm when no one close to me, fix it please",
        "Why does this have such bad reviews, it works perfectly fine for me! Love the design too.",
        "Love all the information it provides. I feel safe and I'm gaining knowledge . Thank you keep up the great job.",
        "It never alerted me to anything. Bet it just says on us.",
        "Pointless if no one else uses it. At this point I trust other people as far as the magic yellow lines in the road.",
        "Tested positive. NY Contact tracer was able to activate it..",
        "This is stupid. Google the CDC weekly flu numbers and you'll see all these Covid numbers are actually flu. There's 23 total flu for 1 week in USA but a billion covid cases? Bullcrap. They just want to do \"the great reset\" .",
        "Data respected/reflected /time travel to the end of Pandemic",
        "No place to download im fully vaciantated app or passport",
        "The only alert I got from this app was when I turn my Bluetooth off at home. I constantly get the notification telling me it can't check for exposures. I spent a while work day with someone that just came off quarantine and didn't get a notification then. There's too many variables for this to be useful and the constant bluetooth notifications were just annoying.",
        "The App appears to have the right concept, but when it comes to what people want to use it for it irrelevant. If I use it I want it to tell me if my working location is safe, not to find out that it's only collecting information. To many cases are showing up around my job, and were finding out by people calling out. We need a tool that is more essential, with a Covid report button.",
        "Waste of space. Waste of memory. Useless",
        "App can be manipulated for false positives. After providing symptoms, it tells me unfortunately and I may have Covid-19, yet my symptoms are for a different diagnosis that someone like myself deals with daily due to other health reasons. So basically this app is not fool proof and cannot be taken seriously.
