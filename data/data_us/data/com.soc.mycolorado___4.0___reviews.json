        "content": "This app is a good idea which is not ready for Prime Time. The app is hard to get set up. One can create an account, but then one needs the \"Authentication\" number which is supposedly emailed. I found that less than 10% of the time did I actually get an email. OK, fine, I eventually got one that worked, and got logged on. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU GET LOGGED OFF, YOU YOU NEED ANOTHER \"AUTHENTICATION\" EMAIL TO GET LOGGED ON AGAIN, AND THEY MOSTLY DON'T ARRIVE. In addition, this app is supposed to be able to be used on the roadside to touchlessly give one's info to a law enforcement officer. If the emails don't reliable arrive to a home with a fast wired connection, think what problems would arise on the side of a remote road somewhere in rural Colorado. And imagine telling a State Trooper \"just a minute, I'm waiting for the email.\" As long as the app requires an unreliable \"Authentication\" I certainly can't recommend it. Shouldn't authenticating once be enough? ADDENDUM: A comment on this review from the State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT asked me to contact their tech support. I had previously done that - they said: \"When you created your account, Ping ID is used to pair your device. I am reaching out to our developers to confirm what email address is connected to your account. As soon as I have more information I will reach back out and let you know!\" After 12 days I have heard nothing. I contacted them again, with a copy of this review, and we'll see if they do anything this time. I know things are weird in this country right now, so I'm willing to patiently wait and see what happens. I'd really like them to address the issue of whether one actually has to do the \"Authentication\" every time one logs into the app, or if that's an error of some sort. Maybe they could comment on that here?",

Setup of the ID was stupid easy, especially considering how much information needs to be verified. The first time I tried to take a picture of the barcode, my phone wouldn't focus on the ID. I exited the picture mode and re-entered it and the problem was fixed. I am using an older Pixel phone so it could be the phone's issue. Very happy I gave this app a try and I am very excited for all the features to come!",
