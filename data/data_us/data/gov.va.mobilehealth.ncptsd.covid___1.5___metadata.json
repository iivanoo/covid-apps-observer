        "Just ran thru available topics and am pleasantly surprised. Shame you need to give access to phone files etc. DEVELOPERS: The \"goals\" page appears in Spanish in the English version.",
        "Is a good app and allows me to regain focus whenever needed.",
        "Some times when things are hard i need a reminder/ nudge to take a step back from the situation. short messages and practices.are just the thing for getting back on the track of mindfulness.",

        "This app is terrific. I've tried several other wellness or meditation apps, and this one is out of the park in its offerings. Plus the narrator voices are calming. There's an outstanding number of exercises for various approaches, and all I've tried were helpful. Well done!",
        "There should be no reason this app needs media, phone and Gallery permissions just to launch. Especially when it prompts you that you can disable them later.",

After downloading, a prompt will say: \"Allow Covid Coach to access photos, media, and files on your device?\" As soon as I tap on \"deny\" the app automatically closes and locks me out of the service. How is this supposed to be helping me? You don't need access to my phone. I'm disappointed.",

        "It is similar to other self help. Easy to use. Makes one think. Asks one questions. Offers advice. Keeps tracks of goals. It all come down to how much energy and honesty one puts into it.",
        "More than Covid, should be renamed, VETERANS COACH or something else, it's great for the help you need when your by yourself and need a break from things. It has helped me greatly.",
        "Well designed and useful. Made for vets with PTSD but can work for anybody with stress, anxiety, or depression. Well designed and thought out.",
