    "description": "SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC.

    "comments": [
        "I love the idea, I installed the app and it worked right away telling me I have not been exposed. I have found one flaw...Ever since i installed the app on 12/27/20 the app states \"Exposure last checked on December 27\" (the day I installed it). So I don't know if the app is working or not? How often is it supposed to check for exposures of nearby persons? Or worse, Is the app working fine, but an indication that nobody nearby me has the app installed? Need more details? I'm an Uber driver.",
        "This was a good idea with a big flaw. Getting a pin is not straight forward. Someone sick with Covid will not take the time to bother getting a pin. It should have been done like this... Sign up with the app with your cell phone number, you get Covid and the county health department should notify DHHS to send the exposure. This would have been easy to do using the cell phone number of the infected person. My wife had Covid and this app. She thought it updated using health department records.",
        "I don't like the set up. It should be automatically updated when someone test positive by the providers or health department that report the COVID cases. I was living with someone with the virus and noticed my phone never went off to alert me. After reading you as the COVID patient have to up the app yourself. This will probably never happen who has time for that. Which makes this app useless.",
        "Disappointed. Not Effective. I've had this for a while; encouraged ppl to download it. Up until yesterday, it worked well - seemingly. It checked for exposures several times a day for the past two months or so. Last week, someone in my pod tested positive. It took her several days to put in a PIN. I've not been alerted yet (but I have isolated since her exposure and then positive test). This program has got to be faster to be effective. It's giving ppl a false of security.",
        "While I love the idea powering this app actually acquiring a pin takes so long that the app becomes useless. I finally received my positive test result four days after showing symptoms and when I called in to get my pin, I was told that I would have to wait a few days and call in again. By the time I actually get my pin the incubation period for the people I may have had contact with will be over and they'll probably have symptoms before they even get any notice from the app.",
        "I tested positive at a minute clinic. When I tried to enter my positive result it didn't have my information. I called and got a PIN, but when I entered it, the app still wouldn't take it. I was able to notify everyone I was in contact with that I knew, but I was out in the world a good bit.",
        "The idea of this app is great, but because of the way it's run it becomes useless. I have had the app for 2-3 months. I tested positive on Dec 29th, so I called to get the required number to alert the app. I was told that I would have to wait 48 hours, I called back and was told that I needed to call my health department and then call back the next day, I called back the next day and was told that my number was 'too new to use try again in 48 hours'. What's the point of using it now?",
        "It's taking weeks to obtain a confirmation pin to share results which defeats the purpose of this whole thing. By the time people get their pins it's been over a week or longer in some cases, which at that point is too late. It's pointless to alert people if it's not immediate. Deleting the app because I'm not ok with tracking me for no purpose.",
        "An absolutely useless app. I tested positive for covid nearly a week ago but have yet to be able to get my PIN. Every time I call in they tell me it's going to be a few days. If you look at the reviews this seems to be the case, that they won't provide you the pin until weeks afterwards. So all in all, this app serves no purpose. What an absolute waste of taxpayer money.",
        "I loved this app until it was updated; since then it has not worked at all. It automatically turned notifications off and wont allow them to be turned on again, and since I deleted it and tried to reinstall it, it has been stuck in a loop for the past 2 hours.",
        "Not sure how effective this is unless there's greater usage than we are seeing now. I was at my docs office yesterday, and was 6 feet away from 2 people with positive tests. Not a thing's showing up on this program.",
        "A few bugs, especially in the Data (last) option page. Give the option to search specific areas like zip code, but won't let you type in anything.",
        "Tho it shows option to choose metrics, they cannot be changed. Having to obtain (& wait for) a pin is an encumbrance & bottleneck as well. Will deter ppl from using the app. Have found this app to be of minimal utility, unfortunately.",
        "Unable to obtain a Pin using the form due to always failing the CAPTCHA. I've tried being case sensitive and not case sensitive. It fails every time. I've tried this on Chrome and Firefox browsers",
        "No this app does not work. I tested positive in December and the still don't have me listed. I've called the number too and they just say to call back in a few days. Useless.",
        "No issues with the app itself. As stated previously, relies on other people to use the app effectively though. During a public health crisis, even if you can't force people to install the app on their phones because they own them, then the company should be able to ban you from using their cell towers unless you install it.",
        "Can't give it anything but a 1.. I just reloaded it yesterday. Had for a while but Uninstalled because it never showed exposure and I knew I had been exposed. Several times. Thought I'd give it one more try. I've got a feeling people aren't going to be honest. So this app may be a dud because of that. I'd give them 6 stars for good intentions but people still run around shopping and everything else. They don't quarantine like they're supposed to. Sad but true.",
        "I have to reinstall it every 2 weeks because it stops updating info. Bluetooth is always on. Great idea for tracing transmission, but obviously not reliable.",
        "Well done from a security standpoint - completely anonymous, only uses randomized tokens for ID (big numbers that change every 15 minutes - no names, etc.). Completely secure and safe. (professional computer geek here)",
        "You should be able to report if you have been exposed to someone with covid or if you know that you had it without having a test. Example, if a family member had it and you are caring for them and you got sick, you don't need to test the know that it was from covid. That could be different levels of reporting from suspected covid to confirmed if you're worried about false reports. SMH tried to report a known exposure but can't without a test = dumb",
        "Great idea if everyone used it and tested frequently. I had Covid in July before getting the app. No notifications of exposure for me even after shopping at a mall for Christmas.",
        "I decided to update this review. I haven't changed the rating as of yet but probably will have to after I get some kind of answers. On January 10th, 2021 my app stopped reporting. On the 11th I had to call off from work due to a fever and symptom scare. I did test negative for Covid, but the timing of it all couldn't be worse. I mean, three days, during my wait for answers. How is that helping anyone? I work at a high traffic State facility and thought I could rely on this to help.",
        "Has not checked for exposures since January 9th. Checked to make sure the app is not being put to sleep. I have had 3 known exposures in the 10 days. Getting tested today, not because of the app.",
        "I avoid as much contact as I can, but having the tool to keep track is another layer of security in this plague/pandemic time.",
        "I haven't gotten the message on this belt since I downloaded it over 6 months ago and I know I've been around somebody it had the coop and they had the app installed on their phone as well",
        "Would love to tell people I've tested positive. app requires jumping through hoops my sick brain doesn't feel up to. Not useful. State already knows, plug the damned info in.",
        "A small percentage of people are downloading this for Android (can't speak for iOS), and such a small percentage of people are actually tested daily in this state. It's more like a gimmick app unless everyone downloads and everyone gets weekly testing.",
        "There aren't enough people using this app for it to be really effective. Also, it doesn't check for exposures very often. A serious flaw in my eyes! It should be checking at least every 15 mins (refreshing) at the very least. It does not allow for exposure time check to be altered in Google. It was a good concept, bad design.",
        "Superb statistics by Tableau...high quality app design. Hope I never experience the notification process! Strongly recommend all to install this free app!",
        "The app is a great concept and was checking when initially installed. On my Samsung S6, it was a power drain. Also, it hasn't checked for exposures since 10/23/20. Today is 11/20/20 so its been almost a month. As COVID case rates are accelerating again, it seems this app would be more pertinent than ever. I'm looking forward to any suggestions that may be offered to resolve these two issues.",
        "Hopefully I will continue loving it while it doesn't show any alert on my phone... Now, the app should have been named either CovidAlertNC, or CovidNCShow, or CovidNCExposure, because it is way easier to find id. First time I tried to find in the list, I could not because obviously it has poor choice name,.. so I turned off BT and sure enough the app complained but didnt say its name... grrrrrr..... So, usability department, please step in.",
        "There hasn't been any check since Dec 25, 2020. This is concerning. The exposure notification is turned on.",
        "Happy to have this app. It was working fine for about a week. I could see that it was checking for exposures multiple times per day. Since 11/20, however, it has not checked for exposures. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still not reporting that it is checking for exposures. All settings seem correct. I have a google pixel 4a.",
        "Useless app! But great idea if it worked. I've tried for days to enter that I tested positive for covid-19 and it refuses to allow me to notify the system. If others are experiencing this then it renders the entire system useless. And secondly you have to voluntarily disclose that you tested positive. I've tried for days to enter my positive test result, but it refuses to issue a PIN necessary to upload. 11/17 update :finally got a pin, and still will not accept alpha-num entry. S9 phone.",
        "It was a great idea but the pin access on the website didn't work.",
        "I check every so often & I last checked it this evening (12/13 ~8:20pm) & it says it last checked exposures at 6:33pm, so that's fine. But what I'm worried about is if other people are actually using the app. I try to stay home as much as possible, but I have gone out recently and I'm concerned that the app hasn't picked up on exposures. Not that I want to be exposed, but it sure would be nice to know if I had, esp given the rate that covid is rising in the state...Samsung galaxy S10 user.",
        "Covid in my family Didn't work.. Then I try to update it and tell of my POS outcome. Says can't find me in system...",
        "So far so good. The more people that get this the better. Haven't noticed a battery drain.",
        "Again, writing a review to state that it randomly stops checking for exposures. I think it happens when I connect/disconnect other things via bluetooth or when I turn bluetooth off/on. The app reads \"Exposure last checked November 20\" it is now the 23rd. Last time I wrote a review I don't think the respondent understood what I was saying - I understand how to open the app and look for the last exposure check, what I am saying is it is not checking anymore for some reason.",
        "One star for the idea. All other stars gone because it doesn't work. Last checked for exposure 11/25/20. I set it up to never be put to sleep, but it just doesn't check and there's no way to force it to update."
