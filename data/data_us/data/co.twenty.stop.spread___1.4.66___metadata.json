        "This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.",
        "I can't even get into the app. Asks me to put in my phone number to get a PIN, but the circle spins and I get a communication error. I have tried at least 10 times throughout the day. It's ridiculous that I have to download an app and give my phone number and other pers9bal information to some third party to get medical tests results. Wish I could give zero stars.",
        "It is just like the other users described. I get notification that test is ready, tells me to download this app, then enter info and cant get past my birthday because it says it is wrong. It isn't wrong and l find it odd that so many people got their info entered wrong by their testing facilities. Im afraid this must be a scam of some sort if not then truly this app needs a lot of work.",
        "I kept getting messages that I had test results, but I had already gotten the results from the test provider. I finally downloaded this app just to make sure I wasn't missing anything... And no, I wasn't. What a waste of time and needlessly shared information. I'm deleting the app and am creeped out!",
        "So frustrated with this app. I have the info from the testing company and I've verified it with them but the app is still telling me the info is wrong so I can't get my test results. Seriously this is the worst! And the response from the developer clearly doesn't read the info I posted. I did verify with the lab, I have the info in front of me, all correct. It is the APP that isn't working!",
        "Updating my review about being unable to put in pin. I had to logout after first making profile and then log back in to use that pin that was texted to me by the app. However I just logged out on my own to see if that would work as there was no indication to so in order to move forward by the app.I was then able to view the results. I hope this helps the app programer and thank you for reaching out in a timely manner.",
        "Complete waste of time, I can't get a detailed report on mine,cannot download my results either, only shows that I am negative. When I try to get my daughter's it won't accept the date of birth and then it locks me out. O stars app,please get rid of it and go back to the old system!!!!",
        "this app is HORRIBLE. Everytime you exit it requests the a passcode you enter the one they text you and it shows up wrong so you have to request a new one ive request 7-10 just to complete my families. They need a better process.",
        "I went and did a rapid test came back negative but your showing me as positive. Hard to believe what's true when your reporting is off. Also extremely dangerous if we was positive and you gave us a paper saying negative we have exposed people unknowingly due to your wacked out test and reporting system.",
        "Good app but for COVID tests the report of the results it gives does not include the resulted date, just the date of the taken same. This resulted test date is determinant for some travel requirements that are time sensitive.",
        "Easy to set up however, birthdate field fails. I entered correct date, confirmed it is the date on file with me provider, app indicates error, dates don't match.",
        "The test took 6 days ,I asked for tje test results to be sooner I was told no more then 3 days,so I had a flight to n.y. booked ,I needed the papers cleared of covid which I am negative.but didn't get them on time so the airline said I could not fly with out it..So ticket was none refundable ,so I not only I could not go to n.y. I also lost the 200 dollar ticket I paid for....Again i asked for the results to be sooner and it took 6 days.",
        "I think this app is fake. .io domain on the website. Why would any state in america use an outside country domain? Still only updated to 2020. They say in a text message my results are ready when they aren't even posted to the actual site the doctor gave me. Something's not right. I'm not putting my info into this.",
        "What a relief, wish health care proxy n children legally obligated to speak and make all decisions for should b entitled to the same comprehensive test results, heart rates, medications, procedures, and the like while the loved on is incapacitated in the hospital. I am being forced t[ to agree with a dangerous procedure without being aloud to explain it to her to aid them in her being compliant. Patient portals to hospital record n chart needs to be granted to those legally entitled to infor.",
        "great app to track covid test results! i really love the security of it as well,, just ole' anybody cant get in\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
        "I don't really know what star to give this app as it has been helpful to a degree. But why I am here leaving this review is that I just recently saw a positive test result, on a day that I never took a test. I could not find any other numbers to contact to bring this problem to anyone's attention. Don't want reported numbers thrown off by inaccurate apps.",
        "This has been an absolute blessing! Everything i have needed (information wise) has been right here at my fingertips without having to leave my house or CALL ANYONE to avoid the long call wait times due to all the calls I am sure they are receiving during this crisis. All of the security measures they are using to ensure it is really you before allowing access to ANYTHING I feel have been very secure. Again Thank You!!",
        "Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.",
        "This app is terrible, I have been trying for 3 days to get my results. I installed the app, got the pin #, tried using the pin and it says \"wrong pin.\" I tried twice, b/c it says you will be logged off after 3 tries. So, I started all over, still no luck. I have had two emails stating my results are ready.",
        "Quick and easy to sign up and log in, and the results are concise and to the point. When I first logged in it contained my test dates, my negative and then later positive results. The only problem is that not all tests in hospital are reported to the Health Dept as I've had at least 5 tests, and only 2 were available on site.",
        "There's something seriously wrong with this app. It won't let me past the birthday screen to see my results. it looks like there's a ton of others that have had this problem based on other reviews and the response is always that the test center put information in wrong. I know that the testing center has my information correct because I have a paper that they printed out with my birthday on it. And would they really mess up enough people's personal info to get this many identical reviews?",
        "HORRIBLE!!!! I can't get pass B'day. Keeps telling me doesn't match. I KNOW MY B'DAY. IDIOTS. Starting to think it's just another way to hack and get personal information. Get rid of this app or FIX IT ASAP. Now the damn thing won't even let me send and/or post my review. Ill give it a 1star only to see if it will then allow my review to post ,but it actually deserves -100 stars. Yeah its just that bad!!",
        "This app gives more than 20 texts one right after another for each notification. It does not do contact tracing to give you notice if you've come in contact with somebody else's covid+. This app is practically useless, doing what it claims to do and it's annoying on top of it. This is basically a governor announcement app. HowWeFeel is an app that is really good and gives a lot more information. It's what I use to help with combating covid-19 worldwide.",
        "No problem downloading the app but it wont let me see results. I don't get past the birthdate and relationship question. When I called the doctor's office they said that they are getting many, many calls about this app and that every single person hasn't been able to get past this screen, and they aren't able to rectify the problem. Now what??",
        "All of a sudden the app switched to a foreign language and I can't read any notifications.",
        "I have never written any kind of review before. Getting my covid 19 results back has been the most frustrating and difficult experience. Im getting notifications that my results are in but they are unreitriveable . I put in the information they ask for and its not accepted . Its been 5 days since mt testing. I've downloaded the Healthy Together app and it just keeps going in circles . I called the testing site (CVS) and they just give me the same phone number ZERO STARS",
        "I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating",
        "This app is almost useless. I followed every step and just couldn't get through.",
        "I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.",
        "As mentioned by others, you get stuck in the registration process. It's anyway ridiculous to have to install an app to see your test results.",
        "Does not work. Tried multiple times. Just get \"an error occurred\"",
        "App was incredibly slow to download and install. I have a galaxy 7 and no issues with other apps. My wireless is in the 26M area. Just left the install to the next day. Opened properly on the second try. From there all good. Put in info, got code, got date screen and results. Thanks",
        "Very unhelpful. After creating an account I was able to see mime and my daughters names that our test results were in. However, when entering our birthdays, ot stated that BOTH of our birthdays are incorrect with what the testing site has on file. Kind of odd, since I filled out both of our paperwork, and have been entering the correct birthdays. Thankfully, we were given a paper copy of and we do know our results. I have downloaded and used the app simply out of curiosity. Uninstalling now.",
        "App would not download no option to check results...total ineptitude. Please provide a contact phone..total app failure...the email to address concerns has gone unanswered. A customer service failure....I am losing business by the minute and the state does not know answers...the county does not know answers...the health care district dies nit kno w answers and your company has no contact info.. .incredible",
        "I cannot even retrieve a pin number. When i request it with my phone number i keep getting a connection error message that pops up. My connection on my phone is good. I have also sent an e mail twice and have gotten no reply.",
        "My date of birth was incorrect therefore I am not able to access my test results. My doctor verified with me that they have my correct date of birth. The Florida Department of Health said they cannot give me test results and to submit a ticket through healthy Together app. Customer service emailed me back and said that they cannot help me and that my doctor has to resubmit the correct date of birth. My Dr verified with me they had the correct date of birth. I can't get my test results.",
        "Where is my covid 19 test result that I have spent 3 hours searching for. This is a disaster. I can't recommend this site to anyone, because it is a mere waste of time. Why does it take too long a time to figure out what to do to get your results. It makes someone very anxious and leaves you with no option but to call at the place you were tested. I am tired and can't get my results, what a complete waste of time and resources. Why do you guys hide my results until I became too anxious and frustrated.",
        "Unable to get a 4 digit pin to open app after the first time. So every time I use it, I have to uninstall and get a new 6 digit access code. One problem is therevis no method to go anywhere without that 4 digit pin. All of you folks who like it have probably only tried to log in once.\ud83d\ude09",
        "I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.",
        "Easy to download and enter information, location, phone number, name and date of birth."
