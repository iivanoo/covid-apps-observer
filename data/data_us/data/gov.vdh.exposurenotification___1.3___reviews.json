Got COVID, but never got a number to enter my positive results in the app. I'm a construction Project Manager and have been on jobsites with lots of COVID cases, and have worked at retirement communities with outbreaks. I never got a notification that I may have been exposed. I assume this is largely due to the barriers in entering positive results. Neat idea, but terrible execution.",

The app is easy to use; you just go through a short setup, and then it runs quietly in the background. Hopefully that's the last you will ever hear of it. If you test positive, you can open up the app and report the test. If another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test, you will get a notification, and then you know you need to go get tested. That's all there is to it. I see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires GPS, but I'm not sure where they are getting that, since it is patently not true. You can see that much by just checking the app's requested permissions from Android's settings menu. It does, however, require Bluetooth to be turned on, since that's how it detects the presence of other devices. TLDR: this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created, let alone kept. If everyone uses it, then people who are exposed can self-isolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on, and that's a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. Use it, and you might just save a life, maybe even your own. When was the last time you did that by installing an app?",
