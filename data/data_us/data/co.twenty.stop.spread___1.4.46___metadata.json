        "I don't really know what star to give this app as it has been helpful to a degree. But why I am here leaving this review is that I just recently saw a positive test result, on a day that I never took a test. I could not find any other numbers to contact to bring this problem to anyone's attention. Don't want reported numbers thrown off by inaccurate apps.",
        "This has been an absolute blessing! Everything i have needed (information wise) has been right here at my fingertips without having to leave my house or CALL ANYONE to avoid the long call wait times due to all the calls I am sure they are receiving during this crisis. All of the security measures they are using to ensure it is really you before allowing access to ANYTHING I feel have been very secure. Again Thank You!!",
        "HORRIBLE!!!! I can't get pass B'day. Keeps telling me doesn't match. I KNOW MY B'DAY. IDIOTS. Starting to think it's just another way to hack and get personal information. Get rid of this app or FIX IT ASAP. Now the damn thing won't even let me send and/or post my review. Ill give it a 1star only to see if it will then allow my review to post ,but it actually deserves -100 stars. Yeah its just that bad!!",
        "I have never written any kind of review before. Getting my covid 19 results back has been the most frustrating and difficult experience. Im getting notifications that my results are in but they are unreitriveable . I put in the information they ask for and its not accepted . Its been 5 days since mt testing. I've downloaded the Healthy Together app and it just keeps going in circles . I called the testing site (CVS) and they just give me the same phone number ZERO STARS",
        "There's something seriously wrong with this app. It won't let me past the birthday screen to see my results. it looks like there's a ton of others that have had this problem based on other reviews and the response is always that the test center put information in wrong. I know that the testing center has my information correct because I have a paper that they printed out with my birthday on it. And would they really mess up enough people's personal info to get this many identical reviews?",
        "Quick and easy to sign up and log in, and the results are concise and to the point. When I first logged in it contained my test dates, my negative and then later positive results. The only problem is that not all tests in hospital are reported to the Health Dept as I've had at least 5 tests, and only 2 were available on site.",
        "First, I'm not sure where the problem is? The wife and I had both the Rapid and the Oral Swab done exactly the same time. She had her Rapid results in a couple hours. I never recieved mine? I called the day after and got my results. The text and E-Mail notification was supposedly sent to me, I never recieved anything? This is not the first time. Last year, the same issue? So, if the app is part of the process there is an issue.",
        "I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.",
        "No problem downloading the app but it wont let me see results. I don't get past the birthdate and relationship question. When I called the doctor's office they said that they are getting many, many calls about this app and that every single person hasn't been able to get past this screen, and they aren't able to rectify the problem. Now what??",
        "As mentioned by others, you get stuck in the registration process. It's anyway ridiculous to have to install an app to see your test results.",
        "The people from Military were very helpful nice Camouflaged uniforms their guidance was very important to us. The people conducting the test very professional & nice it was quick a little uncomfortable sticking that swab up your nose it was quick /Rapid. We got the results right away in 45 minutes time the people conducting the test it was negative results. Amazing Grace . I\"m 64 yrs old and it was complicated for me to see the results there's telephone by calling 3 languages to find results",
        "I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?",
        "I was able to download the app and input my date of birth in order to view my results. However, upon selecting 'confirm' to view my results, the app never loaded the results. The screen stayed on the same display requesting I input my birthday.",
        "I don't know. I could not get past the \"enter dob and relationship\" part. I entered my information correctly. After reading reviews and replies I'm going to guess the medical facility entered something wrong. I thankfully have my results printed out from the facility so I guess I'll settle for what the hospital gave me.",
        "Text received which said results are ready, but result is NOT available on the app. This is very disappointing...getting my hopes up for the result and then....nothing. .waiting again....",
        "Downloaded the app tried to confirm date of birth. It doesn't move from this page. Does not yield or show test results. Waste of time. Perhaps more due diligence needs to be performed before releasing for consumer use.",
        "I have downloaded the app and provided all required information. However I am not able to access my test results. It is trying to confirm and March my DOB with what the testing provider has in their system. Although the date is correct but the app isn't letting me access the result. I don't see any option to collect with the customer support. Please help.",
        "Why do I have pay to get results, when my insurance company has already been charged, sounds like just another way of some agency making more money from a senior citizen that can't afford it. Down on east coast (Palm Beach County) even the test + results are free. I had pay thru my insurance company, otherwise no test in Okeechobee County, also saw County was only given 500 Vaccines for 70 yrs & older this past Tuesday, we have 20 x's that in this County, it's all about the money !",
        "Nice app! Super easy to use and a much easier way to get your test results . Plus it also has great resources on how to take care of yourself and others.",
        "I got the code numbers but couldn't get back to the original page to enter it. Why not use your last 4 of your phone number.",
        "The code was too fast and I couldn't put it in So in other words it did nothing for me . It popped up too fast and I didn't even know what I was supposed to do with it before it was gone",
        "they were very professional and I like that scan so you can put your own information, it makes it so much faster.",
        "Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.",
        "Quick & easy to use. Test results readily offered without much red tape. Thanks.",
        "Unable to get past the confirmation screen after entering my birthdate. Your app does not work!",
        "All of a sudden the app switched to a foreign language and I can't read any notifications.",
        "It keeps asking for my password and there is none. So every time, I had to ask for a new pin! Stupid!",
        "Tried to get my test results but thumb print didn't work and I don't have a pin # to enter. The # texted to me doesn't work as a pin # so I am stuck!",
        "The app would not accept the code that was texted to me. What a frustrating waste of time!",
        "I can't get passed it asking for the pin. It keeps saying to try again. I'm entering the pin that was sent to me.",
        "This app is terrible, I have been trying for 3 days to get my results. I installed the app, got the pin #, tried using the pin and it says \"wrong pin.\" I tried twice, b/c it says you will be logged off after 3 tries. So, I started all over, still no luck. I have had two emails stating my results are ready.",
        "It says the results are ready, but after putting your info in it does nothing. Worthless app and will be deleting",
        "Unable to get a 4 digit pin to open app after the first time. So every time I use it, I have to uninstall and get a new 6 digit access code. One problem is therevis no method to go anywhere without that 4 digit pin. All of you folks who like it have probably only tried to log in once.\ud83d\ude09",
        "Helpful but delayed results, I get my email with my results before I get notified on the app",
        "This app gives more than 20 texts one right after another for each notification. It does not do contact tracing to give you notice if you've come in contact with somebody else's covid+. This app is practically useless, doing what it claims to do and it's annoying on top of it. This is basically a governor announcement app. HowWeFeel is an app that is really good and gives a lot more information. It's what I use to help with combating covid-19 worldwide.",
        "I have received the notification that my results are available, which I think it's fantastic and timely, however I can't get past my birthdate and relationship to patient.... I have not been able to see my results.",
        "I received a text that my results were ready and was directed to this app. Completed the download but still no results. Should have had them hours ago.",
        "Thank you for your suggestion. After clearing the Google Play cache it froze again at 63% (same as before). Then I had to cancel the download again and then try again and then it worked.",
        "I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating",
        "App won't work, keeps saying it isn't responding, asks if you want to wait or close app, they also have my first name wrong, so I can't find out results. Wish there was a direct line phone # to call."
