    "description": "MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nHow MD COVID Alert works:\r\nWhen devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.\r\n\r\nApple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:\r\nMaryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.\r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.\r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!",

        "While I like this concept. I find this mainly a concept. There too many factors to consider before actually relying on this. First, is the person I'm walking pass have a similar application. Second, is the app properly set up. Third, has the person accurately and honest inputted their information. Fourth, is the app constantly working. And Sixth, will I receive information in a timely fashion in order to avoid contraction of COVID. If these things could be addressed then I would feel safer.",
        "Conceptually the app is great. Practically it is of little utility. Make your own judgment. Consider how it operates and whether people not using the app or failing to report their health condition is an Achilles Heel. With that said, when I leave my house I turn on Bluetooth to active this app.",
        "Works well I guess. My biggest gripe is no feedback on the number of contacts made. It would be good to know how many people I have passed by that use or do not use the app in a given day. Why trust the app if I have no idea if it is registering or missing the people I pass by? There aren't even numbers on how effective this app is for me or everyone in general.",
        "Useless! As other reviewers stated, to enter positive results you need a code. My husband tested positive on 1-02-20, and the healthcare providers never reported his positive results to anyone. As a matter of fact, he has several coworkers that also tested positive and I don't think their positive results were reported either. No wonder covid keeps spreading in Maryland! Typical Maryland department of health. (Can't say that I am surprised!)",
        "Not sure how reliable the app is. Also, there is no access to past data. Looks like data only goes back a day or two. How do you know if you were near someone who tested positive say 3 or 4 days ago? Very disappointed.",
        "Worthless. Even after someone in my household tested positive and the MD Health person doing contact tracing told me the app would notify me (due to their manual entry) this app still (13 days later) states that I've had no exposures. Not sure what the app is doing but it's certainly not notifying anyone of COVID exposures.",
        "I have to \"assume\" it works - haven't received an alert, and I have no idea if I've actually been near anyone with the disease. I've had a couple of negative tests and the first vaccine dose so I'm cautiously optimistic.",
        "This app is WORTHLESS, a family member of mine has COVID and it's impossible to use the app. The verification codes do not work and there is no way to problem solve.",
        "This app would be way more useful as a public health tool if it centralized vaccine appointment scheduling across all the administration sites. How often do COVID-infected persons actually report their cases here?",
        "The problem is, it only checks in the evening, when I'm home, not at the times when I'm at work and could actually be exposed.",
        "Optional Use.. Would be great if this was Mandatory for everyone to download. Also, would everyone be honest about their Covid test results??. This app is a great blue print starter. But cant be relied upon.",
        "Garbage. Doesn't work. Incredible that money was spent on a useless app. It gives hope for no reason. You can't report positives. So it doesn't work.",
        "App is dependent on assumptions. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID19/SARS2 testing done by PCR is questionable. It is traditionally a quantitative test NOT a qualitative one used for ID. Viral culture is the gold standard. App presumably works by your phone's bluetooth communication with COVID + patient's phone. This function may not work properly. I have my doubts. Anyway, most people survive. Infectious disease has been part of the human condition since the beginning of time.",
        "For those that tested positive from their doctor they were not able to alert the app. Even after MD Covid called them.",
        "This app would be better if it were more organized and personalized.",
        "Tried to install on 2 different devices and app will only enable notifications on one of them. Update: 01/08/2021 Still unable to enable notifications on Xiaomi 10 Ultra",
        "Keeps telling me to turn on location services and they are on getting very frustrated",
        "I keep it on my phone because I have a weakened immune system and I need to find out if I'm exposed to anybody and I hope everybody has the same app. Trust my wife just came down with ALS so I want to make sure I keep her safe and if I have the app and she has the app now I know that when we get exposed and then we know what to do go get help",
        "Doesn't work. Multiple people at my work have it and it keeps saying no recent exposures. What a waste of tax dollars!",
        "Trying to report myself that I tested positive but it won't let me enter in my verification code. Oh well, good luck everyone who crossed path with me this week.",
        "I have Covid and it won't let me mark I do. When I ask any testing facility or official they tell me it is all handled through CDC... I know it's all bull shirt now... greeeat. Just thought I'll be helpful and tell everybody to stay inside and stop the spread, don't rely on the governor's app, it doesn't work AT ALL. Ive been positive for 2 days. No changes can or were made on my app.",
        "Verification code??? Never got it. Tried a bunch if times... how can this be effective when you can't even use the most basic part of the app?",
        "I was exposed to someone positive. I did not receive an alert. I do not know what the purpose of this app will be, but to report COVID exposure, it is not.",
        "If this app helps slow or terminate the spread of covid 19 or any of its variations I'm all for it!",
        "The app literally doesn't work. There's not much else to say. When you open the app, and press \"Turn on exposure notifications\", all you get is an error saying \"Something went wrong. Try again\". I've had it installed for several weeks. It happened when I first downloaded it, and still continues. I'm going to uninstall it. It's pointless. EDIT: So, I decided to try this app again to see if it had been fixed. I guess I'll never know, because when I try to download, I just get an error message. ??",
        "Great concept, however, doesn't work if you can't report a positive test! It's requires MD health department to give you a code. Contact tracer had no clue that they we able to give a code and couldn't figure it out. My efforts to help the community were squandered by a poor system.",
        "Very basic and not helpful, not as good as the PA state app. MD needs to up their game and show they're serious about getting us to use the app. The app directs us to the MD Dept of Health app which is not very user friendly on mobile devices. In comparison the PA app contains statistics by county, helps you determine if you need a test based on your symptoms, and how to report positive results. MD needs to include the same options.",
        "Broken Process. Useless app. My husband tested positive. The process: your health care provider reports your positive result to the MD Depth of Health and THEY text you a code to enter into the app to report your status. It took 4 days to get that code. Even after entering it, I still haven't received an exposure notification and we're together constantly. Verified all settings are correct. It actually has to work & QUICKLY to benefit individual users & public health. Extremely disappointed.",
        "I wanted to download to support but seeing the reviews and the lack of actual care in updating this app to be on par with neighboring state apps which are way more helpful... I used to use citizen to enable the covid alerts but they removed that feature from the app and decided to try the state app before searching for their tracer app. Way more comprehensive information and you don't need some code from the health department that apparently even the health department can't figure out.",
        "Does not work! Two weeks ago, two people in my home were diagnosed with Covid-19 and I was neither notified by this app nor the Health Dept (maybe the Health Dept knew I would be informed?). I found out today, February 3, 2021 that someone from our school system that myself and my children have daily contact with was diagnosed with Covid-19 in December and we were notified by neither this app, or anyone representing the school system.",
        "Requires GPS to be on all the time. Another reviewer stated the phone's location doesnt need to be turned on, but as soon as I turn it off I get a notification stating \"Exposure Notifications Inactive To use this feature, turn on location\".",
        "Works great just need to get more people to use it.",
        "Does not work",
        "Installation hung, had to reinstall. though feedback is mentioned, no feedback method built into app. to save power would be nice to be able to turn off when at home location where no visitors or exposure is possible. just installed so may be more feedback later, but no method within app.",
        "Updates without proper detailed changelogs.",
        "Wish it was updated to include immunization status.",
        "So far no good because after more than a month of having the app it never showed me a single case of someone near by being positive for Covid19 so this app needs work or be part of another better app...Alone is not working well or is there nobody actually positive for this Pandemic in my area, which I doubt. People do not want to show strangers about their situations, do not blame them, needs a new path and way to release this to us who do not, hope to never get such a horrible sickness...",
        "I very much like the ideal that my state has this app with covid being so bad",
        "It's certainly valuable to have a way of being notified if I was close to someone for 15 minutes who didn't know my name and who came down with COVID-19. The reason I didn't give the app 5 stars is that it doesn't allow me to check in daily and report suspicious symptoms. The only thing I can report is a test result. The other thing I don't like is that there are separate apps for neighboring states. That means that I have to have multiple contact tracing apps on my phone.",
        "There is absolutely no way to turn on exposure notifications. I've tried everything. Keep getting an error message when trying to do it from within the app, and the option is greyed-out when trying from within the phone settings, where it instead gives me a message telling me to install a participating app first. The phone does not seem to recognize this app as a participating app. Samsung Galaxy S20+, fully up-to-date Android OS, but cannot turn this on via app OR phone settings. Please fix."
