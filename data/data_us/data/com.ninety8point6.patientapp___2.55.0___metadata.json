    "description": "98point6 provides on-demand diagnosis, treatment and consultation from board-certified physicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy\u2014all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get the right care at the right time. No appointments, no travel. We\u2019re available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. \r\n\r\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\r\nThere are two ways to get 98point6: via a Personal Plan or a Sponsored Plan.\r\n\r\nPersonal Plans subscriptions come at an introductory rate of $30 for the first 3 months, with unlimited access to on-demand care for just $1 per visit. When that initial period ends, you have the option to enroll in an annual plan for only $120 per year + $1 per visit. (Please note, only one patient per account. You must be 18+ to create an account and seek care; 19+ in Nebraska.)\r\n\r\nSome employers, health plans and retailers provide access to 98point6 at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your plan sponsor.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES MY PERSONAL PLAN SUBSCRIPTION COVER?\r\nYour 98point6 Personal Plan provides you access to our board-certified physicians who offer consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Insurance is not required for your visits. Patients are responsible for any outside-of-app costs, including prescriptions, labs and visits to an in-person physician, if referred. \r\n\r\nWHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS?\r\nOur virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected, board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible and affordable. They are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (98point6 supports photo, video and audio as needed.)\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN YOU TREAT? \r\nOur board-certified physicians are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when it matters, guide you towards the most appropriate next steps. If your issue does require in-person care, you can be sure you\u2019re on the right path to feeling better after consulting with a 98point6 physician. \r\n \r\nCommon conditions we treat include:\r\n\u2022 Cold, cough and flu\r\n\u2022 Urinary tract infections (UTI)\r\n\u2022 Acid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues\r\n\u2022 Yeast infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \r\n\u2022 Muscle sprains and strains\r\n\u2022 Seasonal allergies, asthma and respiratory issues\r\n\u2022 Skin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn\r\n\u2022 Women\u2019s health, such as birth control \r\n\u2022 Nausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis \r\n\u2022 General health questions\r\n\u2022 ...and more\r\n \r\nWHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? \r\nOur doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications. However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it\u2019s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what\u2019s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. \r\n \r\nNote: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.",
