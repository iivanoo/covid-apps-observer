        "(UPDATE: They've fixed all of my previous issues and vastly improved the user interface. If only car dealers accepted the digital DL, then it'd be flawless.) Absolutely useless app. I tried scanning my ID on multiple phones, only to have nothing happen. Tried on my LG, Samsung, Iphone, and tablets with the same result accross all platforms.",
        "The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.",
        "Now that most of the bugs are worked out, it's great. they do need to do a better job of explaining that the picture it takes is for facial recognition to prove that you're the person on your ID and not that it's taking a new picture for the ID.",
        "2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. \ud83d\udc4dWhen this app is working, its amazing.",
        "As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.",
        "MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.",
        "I think this is great. I love being able to switch out what info is visible on my ID. I just wish when I tried to use it, the other person didn't think I was tricking them.",
        "I was so excited to download this app only to be shut out EVERY TIME I TRY TO SCAN MY ID! Please iron out the kinks and I will be sure to come back for a 5 star review.",
        "Whatever issues with the march update isn't affecting my use. Love it and super easy to use!!",
        "Needs to be able to add antique vehicles. Can't seem to add vehicles with Horseless Carriage plates.",
        "This app is awesome! It's a must have for everyone who wants the convenience of having your CO State ID or Driver's License on your phone. There's no way you can lose it when it's at the touch of your fingertips!!",
        "The app itself is good, I haven't the chance to use it yet but I like that I can share everything with one click if needed",
        "Login asks for password and sms code every time. Even with fingerprint.",
        "What a wonderful way to access your ID in the Digital age. I applaud Gov. Polis for being instrumental in giving Coloradoans access to their content digitally.",
        "Captures too much phone info. Spyware.",
        "Terrible third-party software for text verification and face ID.",
        "Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.",
        "My license expired and I renewed on line, but had not received my new card. This app allowed me to have a picture ID accepted almost everywhere in Colorado, while I waited for my new license. Note that some places with age restricted products, as well as airport security, do not accept this digital ID so call before you go if it's your only option. Cool links to frequently used services are on the app. So far no technical hiccups and it has saved the day on many occasions. Highly recommend!",
        "Freezes every time i attempt to scan barcode. Tried both on and off wifi. Reinstalled multiple times. Ensured all permissions are allowed. Then when i try to chat for help, i get queued for 26 minutes until it closes on a Friday. I need help. If you're moving this direction, you still need humans to address concerns.",
        "The app is great and is very convenient specially sens you don't ever go anywhere with out our phones so you always have your id with you this way! I just wish you were able to use it at more places and able to use it to cash checks and wat not but besides those few things it's an amazing idea thanks alot",
        "Great idea. Very convenient. It was so incredibly easy to set up and no hassle from the merchant accepting the digital ID. They seemed relieved that I had digital ID.",
        "My coworker needed to call to verify himself and they were extremely responsive and respectful. I was shocked considering most state job workers are always swamped with tons of work. Great app and soooo convenient to have!",
        "This app is a good idea which is not ready for Prime Time. The app is hard to get set up. One can create an account, but then one needs the \"Authentication\" number which is supposedly emailed. I found that less than 10% of the time did I actually get an email. OK, fine, I eventually got one that worked, and got logged on. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU GET LOGGED OFF, YOU YOU NEED ANOTHER \"AUTHENTICATION\" EMAIL TO GET LOGGED ON AGAIN, AND THEY MOSTLY DON'T ARRIVE. In addition, this app is supposed to be able to be used on the roadside to touchlessly give one's info to a law enforcement officer. If the emails don't reliable arrive to a home with a fast wired connection, think what problems would arise on the side of a remote road somewhere in rural Colorado. And imagine telling a State Trooper \"just a minute, I'm waiting for the email.\" As long as the app requires an unreliable \"Authentication\" I certainly can't recommend it. Shouldn't authenticating once be enough? ADDENDUM: A comment on this review from the State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT asked me to contact their tech support. I had previously done that - they said: \"When you created your account, Ping ID is used to pair your device. I am reaching out to our developers to confirm what email address is connected to your account. As soon as I have more information I will reach back out and let you know!\" After 12 days I have heard nothing. I contacted them again, with a copy of this review, and we'll see if they do anything this time. I know things are weird in this country right now, so I'm willing to patiently wait and see what happens. I'd really like them to address the issue of whether one actually has to do the \"Authentication\" every time one logs into the app, or if that's an error of some sort. Maybe they could comment on that here?",
        "A way to show your ID without digging your DL out of your wallet.",
        "I'm new to the app & will leave a more detailed review at a later date. Just wanted to point out to the person who posted recently & the developers: the app isn't the cause of your old address showing up when scanned, the state's records are. I went through the process of updating my address online last year. Any time I've rented a car since then, my license pulls my old address. If a trooper scanned your card, I'd assume the same would happen, so the digital ID is no more disadvantegous.",
        "A ways to go but a great start. The login process could be smoother, takes a bit to get in so log in before you need it. The image is a bit stretched in the app vs your id card. Lastly, I wish they did more education to businesses so they understand this is a legal version of identification.",
        "Pretty useless. Immediately upon installing and creating the account I'm already getting a message that user name and password are incorrect. Complete waste of time.",
        "Worst app layout, I have seen in a few years. Taxes five minutes to set up, if you have 5 bars. Is heavy, and has minimal, albeit, important use...",
        "Just downloaded the app, I'm trying to create an account and its not scanning the bar code on the back of my ID. The app closes completely everytime I have tried. It's getting a little frustrating.",
        "Not too bad to set up. Maybe an address change I submitted will take, since the app didn't recognize one from April. Have to see how useful it is, since I am old enough I don't need id in bars and restaurants. Selfie was the most difficult part.",
        "App doesn't work don't bother downloading waste of time. I tried making an account and it said I already made one when I tried to make it the night before it claimed the site was down and to try the next morning.",
        "*update* changed review from 1 to 4 stars. After failed attempts to load, contacted support team and it loaded perfectly. Not convenient that, but yes loaded. Has worked great since. Used ID to get fishing license no prob. Used for other times no prob In state. Not used a lot, but nice when I have.",
        "Looks like it would be a great app, if it worked. . . App crashes every time I scan the back of my license. I tried restarting the phone, not having any other apps in use, no luck.",
        "My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.",
        "Easy to upload information. Navigation is intuitive and I like the available features.",
        "This app is ridiculous. I keep installing it over and over and over and over again and restarting my phone over and over and over and over again and everytime I try to scan my ID the app crashes. This is beyond frustrating I don't see why I can't just physically enter in my information this is so stupid.",
        "I have a LG V60. During the selfie facial rocognition the picture oval stays black like its not connecting to my camera. I gave the app all permissions it needs.",
        "Nice. Will be really handy once the digital ID is accepted in lieu of a physical one.",
        "Keeps crashing when I try to upload an insurance ID card. Everything else is awesome!",
        "Everything is working as expected"
