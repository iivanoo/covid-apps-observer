        "I absolutely love this app. I've gotten assistance from the drs for everything from sinus infection to possibly covid to broken foot. They are fast friend and they've been right 100% of the time. At first it was awkward doing this but this is the way technology is going so might asxwell start now!",
        "The doctors are lovely, the app layout is clear and it's affordable. I really do feel cared for and heard in every appointment and I'm able to have quick seamless appointments and easy meditation pick up at my pharmacy. I love this app!",
        "Every experience I've had using 98point6 has been very quick and helpful, and the physicians have been friendly and personable. I have used the app to get a prescription for nasal spray as well as anxiety medication. Definitely beats going to Urgent Care or a Primary Care doctor. As a Type 1 Diabetic, I already have so many appointments throughout the year. It is a relief to be able to handle some visits over the phone at home through 98point6.",
        "I'd heard mixed things about this app/service, but I really like it! It makes it easy to see a provider whenever I like, and the doctors and practitioners I've worked with so far have been attentive to what I needed as well as kind and polite. I'm definitely going to keep using this app/service!",
        "This was so much easier, and faster, and less expensive than a traditional doctor visit! The process from filling out the information on symptoms to picking up the prescription at the pharmacy took less than one hour!",
        "Absolutely useless, I've had 2 appointments and both times they told me to go to a doctor for just routine illness. What is the reason to use this app if they just tell you to go in person everytime? The whole point is trying to avoid going in public while ill but apparently they don't understand that.",
        "Absolutely have had great service that is fast easy and thorough! I've used several times and this is the first place I will go with questions and concerns!",
        "Very easy to use and very helpful! I was able to send pics thru the app and get the meds I need. Definitely will use again!",
        "Horrific experience. I filled out the application and once I got connected (after almost and hour) the doctor said he couldn't help without a single question asked. We won't use it again.",
        "No care dr. Didn't want to help just told me to go to urgent care. I explained no money for copay and no way to get there and she didn't act interested. They say that they are concerned about there patients care. You can say that you care but the actions of the physician says different. If this is there idea of care they need to rethink what care is and what is acceptable. if they think this is acceptable then I worry about others that use this site. No one reached out to me that is not true.",
        "Problem solved - great service, great support! App needs to tell you if your subscription is recurring/non-recurring to avoid confusion! As an aside, I appreciate the enthusiasm from 98's tech support, but I'd rather not receive unsolicited phonecalls - even in an attempt to help resolve issues.",
        "I'm so glad my dad introduced me to this app - since I lost my job to covid, it's been so rough without insurance but this is affordable and I can get my prescriptions refilled easily. Heck, I feel like the doctors I talk to via chat here listen to my concerns more than any in-person visit I've had!",
        "Doctors won't order regular check up or lab work if you ask for. They will tell you to go for an in person consultation. Also it's only for adults, if you have children, they won't help you.",
        "App works really well but is a waste of time. Dr wouldn't answer any of my questions and told me to go see a Dr. I can't really complain though. I guess you get what you pay for.",
        "The app has been great for me as my anxiety causes me to skip appointments or undervalue my care needs. Now I feel that I can get a quick assessment and medication without having to wait at an urgent care and can take care of my other commitments.",
        "I received terrible customer service from the 98point6 doctors during virtual visits on several occasions. They rushed through the visits, didn't listen to me or give me time to explain my heathcote concerns or needs. Their doctors ended the visits abruptly and signed out of the app before I could even finish asking them questions. Highly DO NOT recommend this app!",
        "The doctors are very educated and try to help as much as they can over the phone. It's super simple, you sign up, pay for the subscription (mine was $30 for 3 months) and then you just need to fill out a symptom questionnaire and the doctor will confirm your name and date of birth in video call and return back to the chat in text to help you out. They were able to prescribe me a prescription at my closest pharmacy. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
        "Very nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend. They really want you to be healthy and happy. Thanks.",
        "Needed to speak with a doctor at 6am on a Sunday in the US for some gastro advice (good luck anywhere other than a hospital or urgent care). Absolutely loved the service I received my physician was as helpful as possible, given that we were essentially just chatting. This service isn't gonna cure some random illness you've had for years but it certainly fills a gap when you have important questions that need to be answered in short order and you don't wanna pay a $100+ dollars just to ask them.",
        "Love this app! So easy to use. Friendly Doctors",
        "Really, a text chat appt? What a joke. I will not use this again.",
        "This app has helped me so much expecailly being a mom of four kids under the age of 10 getting to a doctor is very hard. They make sure to ask clarifying questions and address all your issues",
        "Quick, insightful help! I was in a lot of pain and was so grateful to get an appointment from my house instead of traveling in pain.",
        "This app is amazing. Its Easter weekend and everything is closed and here I am with an abscessed tooth! Antibiotics are on their way to a pharmacy near me!",
        "I have had the opportunity to use this app a couple of times. It's great being able to speak with a doctor instead of spending all day waiting in an office.",
        "Quick and Easy. Prescription filled within minutes. Doctor Andrew Le was very professional and helpful. App is easy to use.",
        "Just great. Finally, something in life that is easy and just works as you'd expect... actually, even better.",
        "The doctors that treated me were very kind and helpful. They answered all my questions and the app was super easy and convenient.",
        "Easy to use, quick and convenient for general medical care. Text based symptom reporting and conversation with providers.",
        "Great idea that is executed well. Helped me out of a primary provider jam and got my prescriptions and labs taken care of. Highly recommend.",
        "Very easy and quick, the Doctor was knowledgeable and we were able to get my daughter on a prescription right away",
        "Quick, easy, and nearly the same experience you'd get in a physical appointment.",
        "The doctor I spoke with was very helpful and nice. The app is really easy to navigate. Definitely will continue using",
        "Quick and easy. The doctors are detailed in their questions.",
        "I love being able to discuss symptoms with a Dr and they can help me with figuring out home remedies or if we need a trip to a Dr in person. I feel very confident in the advice they give me. It's a free service through my insurance and I really appreciate it!",
        "The app is so easy to use and the doctor's response time was extremely quick!",
        "Super easy to get some peace of mind from the Search Engine at home doctor results my brain was racing through.",
        "This has been an amazing resource. Have not had a bad experience and have used it twice. Great.",
        "Dr. Lewis was kind, patient, & knowledgeable. I am so grateful for this app.",
        "Easy to use. Perfect to meet my schedule needs and each doctor has provided amazing patient skills."
