        "Super easy. Though i should warn others : if you love video chat , you need good WiFi. The app will tell you that you need WiFi and plus it's difficult to load pictures. But i was able to talk to a doctor and got my answers. I didn't need to wait too long.",
        "Absolute garbage. The app itself feels like a 90s webpage and it's abysmal in terms of managing it's providers. Mine vanished without a trace, leaving me with needing a prescription renewal and the only way to get one was to spend another $175 on finding a new provider in the app. What's the point if you have no doctors continuity? And if this happens only occasionally, why wasn't I informed? Absolute trash -- find a better platform than this for yourself, honestly.",
        "I really like this app, it's pretty user friendly, I've always been connected to a doctor in under 10 mins, they have a large selection of doctors to choose from and the doctors have all been really awesome. They accept my anthem blue cross so I've never had to pay out of pocket. Great job!",
        "First time using app. First time I did an appointment, the doctor had to cancel due to technical issues. I wasnt charged for it. The second time I was able to get ahold of a doctor and she was very nice. Recommend if you are unable to make a same day appointment with doctor.",
        "This is a quick and safer alternative than going into a clinic or doctor's office. The physicians are professional, knowledgeable, and very friendly. I have used this app a few times for myself and my family and it is very helpful for our busy lives. Appreciate all the doctors there!",
        "Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.",
        "I had a pleasant experience with this app. I selected a provider, provided some information and went to a video chat. It was straight to the point and I would use this method again for my medical needs.",
        "Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.",
        "This was my first experience with using the app. I am very pleased with the efficiency of scheduling an appointment the same day and my therapist was very helpful. I will use this app again.",
        "Great first experience! First time I used the app and it ran smoothly. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the video to submit pictures wouldn't work.",
        "Knowledgeable Physicians who Care \u2661 I am new to this telemed visit stuff but since corona virus, i have used this app numerous times and have been super impressed with every person who assisted me! They were able to address my problem, called in an RX to my local pharmacy and offered excellent aftercare instructions as well.",
        "Hands down the best app for the type of person that hates to go to the clinic for a simple concerns about your health and is also afraid of being inside hospital or clinic since I was a child. But are prayers where answer",
        "I had my 2nd visit using this service today. It was quick I was able to do a video call with the doctor and upload a photo that was helpful with the initial diagnosis.",
        "Very different but very helpful and an efficient way to handle this visit.",
        "Very convenient when I can't get in to see my primary physician. Staff here is amazing.",
        "I AM AMAZED! The visit was quick and straight to the point. The doctor was very friendly. I would so use this app again!",
        "So nice to have this for minor issues! Typically I'd suffer a few days before lugging myself to the Dr.",
        "I can't get the sound to go up loud enough to hear the physicians.",
        "Excellent service! I have used them several times and have never been disappointed. Very experienced and knowledgeable! I have used other live Dr's online that seem like your talking to an inexperienced call canter.",
        "Quick, easy, friendly treatment from the comfort of your home.",
        "I always get the best attention, they are direct, concise, knowledgeable and kind. I like this so much more than having to sit in an urgent care!!! Grateful for this service!!!!",
        "User friendly and beyond convenient. Life changing.",
        "Easy to use, quick and convenient way to speak to a doctor.",
        "Very helpful to see a doctor in a timely manor without having to leave the comfort of my home. Especially now durring the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "So much better than having to drive to dr! Amazing Amazing Amazing! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
        "It was painless. I put off doing it cuz I'm technologically challenged. But it was simple. Went real smooth.",
        "Ive only used the therapy portion of this app so my review is based on that. My therapist is great, I scheduled myself for the same time/day every week with no problem. I booked a month out to ensure my appts. Audio & video are fine, I only had an issue last week when I wasn't on wifi, but my therapist called me on the phone & we talked. I live in a VERY rural area, and I have anxiety about leaving the house, so this is a great way to work on that slowly, with proper steps",
        "Very easy and convenient",
        "Fast and convenient! Healthcare in my home!",
        "Connection issues. Tried using this for the first time today and lost connection on both a phone visit and a video visit. Had to call customer service numerous times. I dont feel like the connection issues were from my end. What makes me not want to try this again is having to retype everything over and over, only to have the visit drop and have to start over again. I'm headed to my regular doctors office I guess. Disappointing.",
        "Needed an immediate Doctor appointment for a foot problem. Spent about alot of time on the internet looking at reviews for telemedicine and reviews on google play store. I chose LiveHealth. I downloaded and opened the app and the interface was extremely easy. I punched in my basic data which was super easy and set up my local pharmacy. Took about 10 minutes. I made an appointment and the doctor called me back in less than 5 minutes and called in the script! Absolutley fabulous!!!!",
        "In these uncertain times we find ourselves in under the pandemic and being confined to our homes this app has been a blessing to use for video consultation with medical staff&having prescriptions filled.Ive used it for the past 3 months and had no issues at all. I'm very pleased with this application & Kudos to the content creators \ud83d\udc4d",
        "The video portion kept freezing and then halfway through my session it cut the audio down so low that I could barely hear the person on the other end. I'm really disappointed that I had to end my session all because your application could not keep the audio up.",
        "My daughter saw doctor for bronchitis, he prescribed medicine for 5 days. Her cough sounded exactly the same. The portal did not list the doctor under messages for me to get in contact so I called the main number. They would not send the doctor a message to let him know but instead pushed the issue of paying another $59 for the same issue.",
        "Very nice and easy. Beats having to get out the house and wait in a waiting room( if they allow you to go in with virus protection) so this was very convenient for me and will be going this rout from now on in nonemergency situations!",
        "Great app. Doctors are very helpful. Nice not having to go in for small issues.",
        "As a ER Nurse, I hate going to the ER. Now keep in mind because I work in the ER I would not have to wait like other people would, but just the idea and the length of time it takes in the ER I dread going in. This app keeps me from having to go to the ER. As long as yoi are on wifi the connection is great and you have doctors at your fingertips. This was a great idea!",
        "Living in a rural area this is a life saver the app is very easy to use the layout is simple to understand. The Doctor we spoke to was very helpful and did not rush the visit. I highly recommend this app.",
        "No ability to diagnose. Twice during the week I used the service and both times they were unable to come up with a diagnosis for separate issues. Both times they mentioned I would need to set up an appointment with a doctor to be seen physically. I don't understand the purpose of such a system if they are unablr to diagnose.",
        "Smooth and easy online care."
