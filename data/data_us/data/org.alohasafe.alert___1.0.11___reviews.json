Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.",

So I uninstalled this Nov. 30, 2020, and the Qardio app could connect again. Possibly a coincidence. I'll try this app again in a few weeks, after they've had a chance to iron out the wrinkles. Like I said ... a good idea ... assuming that the app attracts enough users to be useful. It'll need a lot.",
