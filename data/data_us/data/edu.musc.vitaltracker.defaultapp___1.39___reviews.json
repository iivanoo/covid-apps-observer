        "content": "This app does not work for my phone even though It is compatible. I tried to set up receiving the alert through my cell phone it said phone number not available. When I chose the email option I did not receive the email. I then went on line to for help and dialed the number given online and it was the hospital main number. I was then directed to 2 other numbers and no one could help me nor did they know what I was talking about. sincerely, Pauline Mejia",
