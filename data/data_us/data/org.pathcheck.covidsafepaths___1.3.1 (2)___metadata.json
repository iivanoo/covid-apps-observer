        "I like that any location data stays on my phone until I give permission to export it to a health care worker and that it is then anonymized. Looks a lot less intrusive then all the targeted advertising that tracks me and a lot more useful, in my opinion. Cool looking app. Now just waiting for my health department to integrate it.",
        "No instructions how to use! I have no idea where to get the \"healthcare authority\" URL the app asks for and therefore receive nothing about COVID in my area.",
        "I'm not sure what good this does when there's only 5 health department listed and 3 of them are in INCREDIBLY unpopulated regions. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
        "I like having the ability to start doing *something*. Recording myself now, then able to work together with my community later when my Healthcare Authorities adopt the system. And I like that I am able to do this without compromising my personal privacy and with an unknown entity to that I am expected to believe is trustworthy.",
        "One of the very few safe and privacy-centric contact tracing app.",
        "Such a cool idea! Simple user interface and great way to trace this",
        "The app developers need to make it clear this isn't the official government app. It's irresponsible for them to position this in the store knowing people are searching for the Govt App. To find the Govt App search \"Covid safe\" as two words and look for the official green logo distributed on well know public news sources.",
        "Do not download this app, search \"Covid Safe\" with a space between the words to get the actual Australian Government app.",
        "Just got notified of the data instantly now. I'm safe! Easy to use.",
        "This is not the Australian Government application of a similar name. You need to search covid safe (with a space in between) to find that app.",
        "Private data is being used beyond COVID-19 boundaries.",
        "Can developer of this program confirm if it works in the uk. If it does what trusted source or authority do i input when setting up",
        "Easy to set up and I appreciate that my information is kept on my phone so it is safe.",
        "Energy hog. Not enough people using it.",
        "None of my personal information has been asked for... What's the point???",
        "Made with privacy at its core.",
        "If you decide against this download in the current climate you are a pest.",
        "Your a fool if you don't download this app",
        "Not the app endorsed by the government",
        "Works really well",
        "NOT THE AUSTRALIAN GOV APP",
