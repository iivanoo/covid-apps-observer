        "Novel concept. However, I've noticed a significant reduction on my phone's battery life.",
        "I'm excited for an app to notify about exposure, if we had this 6-9 months ago we could have seriously flattened the curve and saved lots of lives. This app will need pretty good installation rate to be effective. It looks like 5k installations today so far.(I think this is the first day), hopefully the adoption continues. We needed this 6-9 months ago, before the vaccine was available to slow the spread. Well here's hoping lots of people install it!",
        "Thankful to know if anyone I know has gotten covid or if I spread it somehow, but alas it was never necessary.",
        "Doesn't work with bluetooth turned off and I keep BT off for battery and syncing security. I have never had this app send me a notification and my work has had exposure. So why is it an app?",
        "I appreciate that this app allows people to be notified anonymously that they've been exposed so maybe people will feel more comfortable communicating testing status vs trying to reach out to everyone they may have been in contact with. Hoping enough people download it to make a difference.",
        "Easy install and ability to share the app with others. Would rate it higher but so far no vital information has been shared as the only way it works is if a majority of people install/use it. PSA to other users....Share the word post it on social media.",
        "Very intrusive. Runs during phone calls. It also drains my battery.",
        "Does not work, I work in a hospital and have a patient who is Covid positive. I am touching the patient although I am following Covid protocols. This program is telling me that I have no exposure.",
        "Easy to use and gives piece of mind",
        "Everything I need to know about the weather before going out with my dogs for a walk",
        "Pretty neat, too bad we didn't get it 8-9 months ago.",
        "I understand the need to collect data (and work in the data mining field). While creative, and useful, I feel this opens a pandoras box of privacy violations in which I won't participate. This came down as part of some other process.. I noticed only by the red indicator on my status bar.. I dont appreciate the non consensual invasion in my privacy",
        "This app is absolutely useless. It says it is regularly scanning for exposure, but the only things that seem to be in the log is when I actually open the app. I must be the luckiest SOB on the planet to have zero exposure in the time I had this app at my high risk job. It is a drain on the battery life. Buh bye.",
        "Definitely late to the game, but I am happy to see Utah finally supporting the Exposure Notifications System.",
        "I had this app installed for a few months and finally decided to uninstall tonight ... I downloaded the app to receive notifications, unfortunately the only notifications I ever received was when my Bluetooth was turned off or my location was turned off. Utterly useless app",
        "We're currently wasting millions of vaccines on people who have already had covid and are likely immune, but don't know it. Do your part for getting society up and running by downloading this app, getting tested, and not being a weirdo about masks. We all want the end of the pandemic.",
        "No way to post vaccination status, sure you post covid +, but if can't post vaccine status how good is it?",
        "It takes up space on my phone and uses battery and data resources. At this point in time, it is just another drain on resources.",
        "I guess it's a good thing I've never seen it do anything? I don't know lol",
        "Violation of HIPPA. My medical history is none of your business. You thought your phone was tracking you before? Wear a mask and mind your own.",
        "You have to have bluetooth on and location on all the time. B.S.",
        "I downloaded this just for fun. Let's see if it can brainwash me or feed me fear \ud83d\udc11\ud83d\udc11",
        "Keeps me informed than the news paper ect",
        "another part of this state's abysmal response to the pandemic.",
        "Excellent to have someone tell you you're sunburned or not",
        "Needed in times like these",
        "Yeah... I'm just not okay with this. Like I get they want to beat the virus, but letting everyone know you have it is a bit much. Not everyone needs to know.",
        "Let's hope enough people install this.",
        "Haha government go pssssshhht",
        "About time Utah felt like making one.",
        "Let's you know if you've been exposed to the China Flu!!! You only have a 99.7% chance to live!! Oh no!!! Much scary!! Better give up your freedoms and hide behind 13 masks if you want to survive!!!",
        "No one is even a tiny bit concerned as to how this app works......really?",
        "Grose invasion of privacy",
        "It an OK app.",
        "Easy install.",
        "Don't use",
        "Ok job",
        "Good game"
