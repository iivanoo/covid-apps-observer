        "Very easy to use, doesn't require any personal info. It does require bluetooth but it's anonymous and you can keep it off at home and just use it when connecting to wireless headphones/remember to turn it back on when you go out. Only criticism is it's only in english and spanish, needs more languages. You shouldn't have to know english to be safe and keep others safe. It's just accessibility.",
        "Very easy to install, set up, and leave on (i.e. rarely open again) your phone to scan automatically for your potential exposures via Bluetooth. Also non-intrusive/anonymous and lets you know recent local trends and symptoms. Clean, simple interface. It would be great if additional languages could be offered in addition to English and Spanish.",
        "It's very easy to set up but there is some issues that I have heard from other people concerning using this on an Iphone 6 but over all it is a very good app to track if you have been exposed. The only thing I can say is that if you don't usually take your phone every where then it could throw off the results on the app. But again it is a very good app.",
        "I have used the app for about one week now. And there has been no contact warning. Was just wondering if it is still working. I just checked the number of installs and it's more than 10 thousand. That means that less than one of us gets positive each day. Its unlikely that we have had any contact in say the last week. No news is good news.",
        "This app will never work! People who have covid-19 break quarantine all the time, you still see people not wearing mask, no ones checking on people in quarantine, everyone's still having gatherings with more then 10 ppl.. The list goes on... So don't download this it's worthless you'll never get a notification!",
        "Easy to download, setup and navigate. The more people that use it the better it works.",
        "Useless app. People with COVID19 are supposed to be quarantined. Will not work unless other phones have Bluetooth on.",
        "Interesting app... Although with only around 5000+ downloads I'm not sure if the rate of population with this app installed is enough to achieve its intended purpose.",
        "No one checks if you have downloaded the app upon arrival on Maui. It consumes a lot of battery.",
        "Easy, easy, easy. The app installed in seconds. There is NO setup. It doesn't ask for any input at all. You don't need a username, password, or email address. Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.",
        "Very thankful Hawaii has an app like this. It's straightforward and non-intrusive.",
        "Got aloha safe app cause i live on maui, Hi and am worried about covid numbers rising dramaticly daily so i only activate it when im out grocery shopping or going to the doctors office or anywhere in public then i deactivate it cause it drains battery life and does weird things to my phones touch screen and interferes with other apps on my phone when its on",
        "Great concept and actually really secure. Of course info security risk is the big red flag here, but after some serious digging it all checks out and they do keep your info safe.",
        "Easy to install. Like the concept.",
        "Quick and easy.",
        "Idiotic making an app that's not backwardly compatible. My wife's iphone 6+ is up to date however the iphone version of the app won't install because it wants a newer update? Brilliant!",
        "At 10k downloads, roughly 0.71% of Hawaii's 1,416,000 population are using this app (unless my math is wrong). It's a great app, but more people need to know about it to be truly useful.",
        "Awesome App and easy",
        "This app shares the weakness of all of these apps in that it doesn't warn me of shorter exposures rather only if I've been exposed for 15 minutes. Plus it doesn't tell me where the hotspot areas are so I have no way of knowing where or when I should avoid certain places. A minor but annoying point was that this app interfered with the playing of Bluetooth in my car.",
        "Good idea ... But not yet ready for prime time, methinks. After I installed it, I could no longer use my Qardio Blood Pressure machine, which also communicates via Bluetooth. So I uninstalled this Nov. 30, 2020, and the Qardio app could connect again. Possibly a coincidence. I'll try this app again in a few weeks, after they've had a chance to iron out the wrinkles. Like I said ... a good idea ... assuming that the app attracts enough users to be useful. It'll need a lot.",
        "Horrible. Forced installed. UNSAFE!!!! UNINSTALLED!!! BEWARE",
        "This app has a bug in it. On a moto 6 it grabs the Bluetooth and won't release it. So you have to reboot your phone to connect to your car's hands free system. It should also allow you to adjust exposure time. 15 mins is way too long given the higher contagion strain.",
        "Quick and easy Hope that more pplpz use this and let others know if get the virus by dem",
        "works as exactly designed to.",
        "My mother is high risk so I felt this app was a great idea. I tried downloading it but it said I didn't have enough space. So I delete three apps that I don't need and some useless pictures. It still says I don't have enough space. So I check how much space I have and it says 615 MB, which should be more than enough to download the stupid app. I check and this app only requires 22MB. I try to redownload and it doesn't work again. Great concept but it won't even let me try it out.",
        "This app downloaded itself on my phone do not trust this app at all. This is not okay.",
        "Simple, noninvasive app. Yes I want to know! All voluntary and keeps me mindful.",
        "Keeps me in peace of mind.",
        "Downloaded just to delete. I hate when apps are shoved in my face",
        "I can take care of myself as well as people around me. Don't need this. Shame on victorino for forcing.",
        "I get in person school soon, so if I get one notification that someone get covid I gon start runnin brah",
        "No experience with this yet",
        "unconstitutional mandatory download of app. infringement of rights. state of hawaii gov will be sued over this. developers of app should be ashamed of themselves.",
        "excellent love it",
        "This is my 1st time.",
        "Force install?!? Goodbye, deleted..",
        "Hope it works doesent sound great. Tbh",
        "Awesome.",
        "Elpata",
        "Very informative"
