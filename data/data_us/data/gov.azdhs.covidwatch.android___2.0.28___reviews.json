Then it will randomly inform you that you have a notification and, when you click to find out what it is, it will tell you that you have no notifications. You'll have an icon that sits in your notifications for 12 hours telling you that it's looking for exposures that can't be dismissed. Also, you can't even choose Phoenix nor Maricopa County as your location despite that being the most populous region of the state; your options are Tucson, Flagstaff, and \"State of Arizona\" which apparently isn't even functional.",
