        "Most users won't have the patience or technical know-how to setup or use this app correctly which makes it nearly completely ineffective. The FAQ site did not have any info on where I could find a confirmation code to report a positive test; I found the answer in the freaking app reviews (CDPHE will eventually text you the code). While the idea is novel, the execution actively discourages adoption and use by anyone except tech-savy users.",
        "I find as others have said not getting notified. I would also like to see the areas in which covid is reported and numbers. This app seems pretty useless. I hope we as coloradoans aren't having to pay for this. It's clearly broken and doesn't work. Going to delete hate wasting space on my phone.",
        "It seems rather useless. It's entirely dependent upon people reporting themselves. It's never reported a possible exposure until today. There is a zero chance that I don't encounter at least one covid positive person within a hundred feet of myself on a daily basis. The possible exposure was seven days prior to the notification. It said to quarantine immediately... Seven days ago. Yikes.",
        "The app seems great (simple, unobtrusive, easy to use, no major privacy issues) but what good is the app if people can't easily report their covid results? Why haven't they partnered with testing facilities to provide this code automatically upon getting a positive result? I've had this app for months and haven't gotten a single notification ever",
        "App is fine and has not caused issues that I know of. It's completely useless. I work in retail and with the infection and positivity rates in the Denver Metro and suburbs you would think I'd have come in contact with someone who had tested positive over that month I've had the app.",
        "The app appears useless. I tested + . When I try to enter the result, it asks for one time verification code. After extensive searching, I was unable to learn how to get the verification code.",
        "Won't Enable. Every time I try to enable it says something went wrong. Others gave the same issue. I emailed app maker. No response. I hope CO isn't paying for this broken app.",
        "Deleted. It requires bluetooth on which depletes my battery. Was a good idea but unworkable.",
        "App doesn't work. Didn't notify me when co-workers had it. I can't put in that I currently have it. Needs some verification code but doesn't tell you where or how to get that. Sure this was a big waste of tax dollars",
        "I don't like the fact I have to keep it on if I'm at home and don't come in contact with anyone else. There is no reason why I should keep it on at home, it's a violation of my privacy and my right to chose. I'm well aware of the capabilities Bluetooth technology has it's the things it can do that your app doesn't mention that bother me. Every Bluetooth device I have will Transmit not Rx the signal back. I'm 99% it's ur app. Now my tablet need resetting and the time it takes to reinstall is,.",
        "My wife works with covid patience. So needless to say, she is in contact with covid positive people. Her app says \"no contact\". Four people I work with have it. Nothing from the app. Broken. \ud83d\ude20Wish it worked better . Merica, thanks",
        "My phone hasn't worked right since..tells my blue tooth is off when it's on..stupid",
        "I have had countless people in my life get COVID 19 and this app has been silent. Absolutely a pointless app.",
        "Thanfully I have had no notifications but this is a great help for Colorado to trace and inform.",
        "So excited to have an app to help inform about potential exposures. Thank you, CO DPHE!!",
        "Excellent design with regards to privacy and seems to work seamlessly in the background. If you read the reviews here very few negative reviews actually have anything to do with the app itself or it's capabilities. It's interesting how people are happy to give you identifiable information for no real reason, but get all concerned when it's something that actually benefits the public and doesn't give up identifiable information.",
        "I discovered the magic link was being texted to my home phone number! Mine is through Google Voice so I get an email copy. That email goes to a seldom used gmail address and the link won't open on anything but my mobile phone but clicking on the link bypasses the need for a code. Still one star. There's no documentation, it's pretty stupid to text a home phone especially when you have an email address and you shouldn't have to have an engineering degree to figure out reporting.",
        "Tested positive for covid but got no number to use in this app.",
        "This tool has a serious flaw. In order to notify others of a positive test result, you need a verification code. There is no explanation as to how to get this verification code. I have found media articles saying that a contact tracer may call me and provide this number. I'm on day five of potentially exposing others. I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Please communicate how we are supposed to verify positive test results.",
        "I am so angry. I cannot share my covid test results bc I dont know what a covid verification code is. Seriously what the hell is that? I cannot find any info from this app on what that is nor how to find my own. It should be obvious! You should explain what that is! If you can't share a negative result then state that!",
        "This is an excellent tool. I think they could do a better job informing people on how they get the code to start the notification part though. For those interested, the health department can generate the code for you when you receive a call from a contact tracer. You cannot just trigger it based on a positive test result. Please answer the phone when they call after you have been tested or call them back.",
        "It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.",
        "As others have pointed out, this program has a huge flaw. I tested positive for covid and I am not able to tell the program the app on the phone that I am positive because it needs some verification code that I don't have. Pretty much makes the app useless if nobody can report themselves as positive.",
        "I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.",
        "This app is completely useless. I have been around three people who are verified positive for covid-19. Also my wife just had a positive covid-19 test and we have not been able to put that information on the application because there's nowhere to find a code to enter that is requesting. Might as well just remove this app completely.",
        "The previous complaints of not being able to fill out the app to notify people if you have been positive should be addressed in two ways: it should either be on the person who tested positive to figure out what the test number is from the department they used to get tested and it should be on the applications developers to notify people of this strategy. So both. But really it's just one thing.five stars because this is obviously helpful I think I mean some people might be embarrassed but whatev",
        "Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.",
        "DOES NOT WORK! I work for a government entity and we recently had three positive cases on our floor alone in this building and we didn't get a single notification not when it started and not two weeks later. This app is a complete failure and a waste of your battery time and space!",
        "This is a great idea in theory. Unfortunately when you try to report a positive test result it asks for a verification code. To get a code you must look up your local public health agency, call them and ask to speak to a COVID-19 case investigator. Then give that person a bunch of information in order to get a code (none of which is explained on the app itself). With this much hassle required in order to simply report a result, this app is doomed to be an utter failure.",
        "1 star based on the fact that the play store pushes the app on you and it does nothing helpful",
        "Good call, Colorado but an issue with the app is that there is no verification code sent when trying to enter test results. I suggest you make this process a little more clear, and provide an FAQ if anyone else has run into this as well.",
        "Have the developers done away with the requirement for the verification code?I didnt see 1 review where a person stated the app successfully notified them.I did see plenty where ppl said it failed to.That's a good indication that something has got to be done.Perhaps notify ppl that there is a chance they came in contact with a user who reported positive results, however verification is still pending?When talking importance, 1st over all should be the need for users to report pos results IMMEDIAT",
        "I tested positive for covid and had no idea how to get the code to report my positive test. I seen its supposed to come from a contract tracer however they were so backed up they announced they're unable to contact everyone that is positive. So I never got contacted, and never got the verification code or link. This app was pointless. I don't trust the accuracy knowing how many people probably had the same experience as me.",
        "For those with privacy complaints: **Before you ask, this app doesn't have location access.** When you turn on this app, it will generate random numbers every so often and share these numbers with a central server. When you pass by someone in bluetooth range, it will share your current number with them. If they report positive, all numbers they have been around will be notified of the positive test. No names, no locations. Simple, private, secure. I like it.",
        "This app is too difficult to use for such a life threatening issue. It needs to be more intuitive before the public will actually begin using this app. It is should be easy to use by those who are not comfortable with technology, yet I am very comfortable with technology and the app took a while to figure out Please do something to make this better",
        "People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.",
        "Time is of the essence! Trying to help a friend report a positive, but without the code it's pointless. Why create a roadblock like this that slows down awareness for everyone???",
        "Anonymous and opt-in only so your information and privacy is protected. Since it's release, the old manual verification system has been updated to be more automated. This app can save lives and works better when more users have it installed.",
        "I tested positive for Covid on Oct. 26 and have never been able to report it because of the verification code issue. I even spoke with Tri-County Health and they couldn't help. Worthless app.",
        "Cannot turn on. Says: Something went wrong. Try again. 11.30 - still getting same error. 12.18 with new OS update still the same error. The Wyoming app works for me. No response from dev email."
