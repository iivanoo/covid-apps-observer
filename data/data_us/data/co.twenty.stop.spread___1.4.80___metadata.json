        "easy to use and get your covid results faster than your doctor even calling you. I was notified at evening and then on a weekend so I didn't have to wait until the next day or in the case of the weekend, Monday, to get my, thank the Goddess, negative results. it also has the history of your test results.",
        "Downloaded the app. Followed the instructions. Until they asked for the phone unlock code. I wouldn't have been using phone if it was locked. ? The folks providing the vaccine said they would email me as I had instructed. They did. So why are you texting me to install your app? I'm now going to uninstall now. And don't expect to hear from you again.",
        "Relieved when read plenty of good information. The Art used makes it attractive to look for more, the selection of words to explain information is lovely, fantastic, understandable. Congratulations. Thanks.",
        "This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.",
        "I have great services and information about my procedures, this is very much better than waiting on hold, this app I'm sure is better for the staff as well. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00",
        "the Health care workers were in the community the test were done it was an easy process and the results were send to my phone and it were free. I were very grateful for the test.",
        "Very difficult and frustrating to place Pin # in order to get test results. It took several attempts to finally get my negative results.",
        "this app didn't work. wouldn't even download. Maybe doesn't work on a Sunday. Downloaded it on a Monday and it worked fine",
        "Cannot get pin no. To verify phone no. Use mobile instead of land line and it works fine.",
        "I can't even get into the app. Asks me to put in my phone number to get a PIN, but the circle spins and I get a communication error. I have tried at least 10 times throughout the day. It's ridiculous that I have to download an app and give my phone number and other pers9bal information to some third party to get medical tests results. Wish I could give zero stars.",
        "Complete waste of time, I can't get a detailed report on mine,cannot download my results either, only shows that I am negative. When I try to get my daughter's it won't accept the date of birth and then it locks me out. O stars app,please get rid of it and go back to the old system!!!! Also,I reached out to the support system several times, got 0 response from them.",
        "only issue I have is that when you log in if you make a mistake three times it locks you out",
        "This application does not work. I cannot get my current testing results, only results that are two months old. Complete waste of time.",
        "please be advised that I went and I get three negative test and I went to the Hospital and get tested positive couple days after however the individual that's doing the test are not taking it seriously",
        "I think that everyone needs to get the COVID vaccine so that we can be rid of this thing once and for all. I know that there are those who don't believe but you did not believe that things WOULD change in 2020 but it did so why not give the COVID vaccine shot a try.their are a lot of things to gain and only ONE thing to lose.",
        "I don't really know what star to give this app as it has been helpful to a degree. But why I am here leaving this review is that I just recently saw a positive test result, on a day that I never took a test. I could not find any other numbers to contact to bring this problem to anyone's attention. Don't want reported numbers thrown off by inaccurate apps.",
        "I kept getting messages that I had test results, but I had already gotten the results from the test provider. I finally downloaded this app just to make sure I wasn't missing anything... And no, I wasn't. What a waste of time and needlessly shared information. I'm deleting the app and am creeped out!",
        "This has been an absolute blessing! Everything i have needed (information wise) has been right here at my fingertips without having to leave my house or CALL ANYONE to avoid the long call wait times due to all the calls I am sure they are receiving during this crisis. All of the security measures they are using to ensure it is really you before allowing access to ANYTHING I feel have been very secure. Again Thank You!!",
        "Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.",
        "Trying get and remember pin number before you can get bin see it whatever don't like it won't use it don't bother me again",
        "Got notice that results were ready. Logged in successfully but no results available. It said check with doctor if no results after 5 days.",
        "Keep getting a text about my results and will not show me mine i can only view my sons results doesn't seem to work for multiple household members under the same phone number",
        "Quick and easy to sign up and log in, and the results are concise and to the point. When I first logged in it contained my test dates, my negative and then later positive results. The only problem is that not all tests in hospital are reported to the Health Dept as I've had at least 5 tests, and only 2 were available on site.",
        "It is just like the other users described. I get notification that test is ready, tells me to download this app, then enter info and cant get past my birthday because it says it is wrong. It isn't wrong and l find it odd that so many people got their info entered wrong by their testing facilities. Im afraid this must be a scam of some sort if not then truly this app needs a lot of work.",
        "There's something seriously wrong with this app. It won't let me past the birthday screen to see my results. it looks like there's a ton of others that have had this problem based on other reviews and the response is always that the test center put information in wrong. I know that the testing center has my information correct because I have a paper that they printed out with my birthday on it. And would they really mess up enough people's personal info to get this many identical reviews?",
        "This app gives more than 20 texts one right after another for each notification. It does not do contact tracing to give you notice if you've come in contact with somebody else's covid+. This app is practically useless, doing what it claims to do and it's annoying on top of it. This is basically a governor announcement app. HowWeFeel is an app that is really good and gives a lot more information. It's what I use to help with combating covid-19 worldwide.",
        "No problem downloading the app but it wont let me see results. I don't get past the birthdate and relationship question. When I called the doctor's office they said that they are getting many, many calls about this app and that every single person hasn't been able to get past this screen, and they aren't able to rectify the problem. Now what??",
        "I have never written any kind of review before. Getting my covid 19 results back has been the most frustrating and difficult experience. Im getting notifications that my results are in but they are unreitriveable . I put in the information they ask for and its not accepted . Its been 5 days since mt testing. I've downloaded the Healthy Together app and it just keeps going in circles . I called the testing site (CVS) and they just give me the same phone number ZERO STARS",
        "Updating my review about being unable to put in pin. I had to logout after first making profile and then log back in to use that pin that was texted to me by the app. However I just logged out on my own to see if that would work as there was no indication to so in order to move forward by the app.I was then able to view the results. I hope this helps the app programer and thank you for reaching out in a timely manner.",
        "I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.",
        "So frustrated with this app. I have the info from the testing company and I've verified it with them but the app is still telling me the info is wrong so I can't get my test results. Seriously this is the worst! And the response from the developer clearly doesn't read the info I posted. I did verify with the lab, I have the info in front of me, all correct. It is the APP that isn't working!",
        "This experience has been very helpful & easy. I am grateful for your wonderful efforts and talents! This app. ROCKS!!!",
        "Very unhelpful. After creating an account I was able to see mime and my daughters names that our test results were in. However, when entering our birthdays, ot stated that BOTH of our birthdays are incorrect with what the testing site has on file. Kind of odd, since I filled out both of our paperwork, and have been entering the correct birthdays. Thankfully, we were given a paper copy of and we do know our results. I have downloaded and used the app simply out of curiosity. Uninstalling now.",
        "I went and did a rapid test came back negative but your showing me as positive. Hard to believe what's true when your reporting is off. Also extremely dangerous if we was positive and you gave us a paper saying negative we have exposed people unknowingly due to your wacked out test and reporting system.",
        "App would not download no option to check results...total ineptitude. Please provide a contact phone..total app failure...the email to address concerns has gone unanswered. A customer service failure....I am losing business by the minute and the state does not know answers...the county does not know answers...the health care district dies nit kno w answers and your company has no contact info.. .incredible",
        "My date of birth was incorrect therefore I am not able to access my test results. My doctor verified with me that they have my correct date of birth. The Florida Department of Health said they cannot give me test results and to submit a ticket through healthy Together app. Customer service emailed me back and said that they cannot help me and that my doctor has to resubmit the correct date of birth. My Dr verified with me they had the correct date of birth. I can't get my test results.",
        "Unable to get a 4 digit pin to open app after the first time. So every time I use it, I have to uninstall and get a new 6 digit access code. One problem is therevis no method to go anywhere without that 4 digit pin. All of you folks who like it have probably only tried to log in once.\ud83d\ude09",
        "I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.",
        "Can't even login. Had a pin texted to me. I typed the numbers but there is no button to press for enter and the \"next\" function just moves the cursor around. Edited to add: could not make app work on Samsung Galaxy S10 but it did work on older S7.",
        "Good app but for COVID tests the report of the results it gives does not include the resulted date, just the date of the taken same. This resulted test date is determinant for some travel requirements that are time sensitive."
