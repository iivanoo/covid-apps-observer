I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.",
