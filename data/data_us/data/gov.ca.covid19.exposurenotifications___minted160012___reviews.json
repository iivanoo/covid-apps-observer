Only one issue so far: The app encourages you to share your test results, \"especially if you have tested positive,\" which implies that you can share negative test results as well, no? But the \"Share COVID-19 test result\" button only prompts you for a verification code... which is only given for positive results, right? Am I missing something? Or was the description under the \"Notify Others\" tab simply written using ambiguous/misleading language?",
