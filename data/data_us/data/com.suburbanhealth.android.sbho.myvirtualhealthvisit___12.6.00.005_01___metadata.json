        "It was a awesome visit, covered all issues and were dealt with. My Doctor is a compassionate Doctor but strong about what she wants or doesnt want , is very explanatory thou. Very decisve Doctor. The video chat was smooth vision clear, sound clear. Is simple as can be to load and was self explanatory... I really like it , give it 5 stars and would definitely , absolutely reconmend this app. For quick smooth efficient visit with your own doctor...",
        "I had just a tiny square that showed and when I went to switch the camera to the back camera it wouldn't let me. So I had to try and look at the tiny piture on the phine w it turned facing my foot. Then had to try and get a good view of my foot with it twisted around. Would be nice if it switched so it wasn't so difficult for tye Dr to see.",
