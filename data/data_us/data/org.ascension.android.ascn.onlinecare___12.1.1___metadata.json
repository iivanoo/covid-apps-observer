        "The program freezes up and constantly has to be restarted",
        "The concept is awesome, but it would be beneficial to have interaction with the \"patient portal\" that seton ascension clinics use. Or even to see services and billing history that you can interact with within the app itself.",
        "Love it. Best idea especially if you got that kind of elderly parent who won't listen to you and is very stubborn lol, who needs to hear it from a professional to determine they're options.",
        "We use the virtual appointments. But if you receive a phone call during the call the volume will drop to low to finish the appointment.",
        "Requires wifi which is not always readily available. Does not work well on cellular network",
        "Worked better than any online Dr I have ever visited. No lag or anything.",
        "I had a virtual appointment with my Dr and it was very convenient.",
        "Extremely hard to get help with prescription medication if local pharmacy cannot obtain the drug. Customer service support number is 'no longer in service' when called.",
        "Great appt easy to use",
        "All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???",
        "I love using this app the doctors are very knowledgeable and it's quick and easy. With everything that's going on in the world today it makes staying home and staying safe easy.",
        "Easy and simple to use and has excellent video and audio quality! I had a visit with my son's doctor and it's so much better than needing to go in to the office!",
        "Completely useless app, freezes every time I open it. No menu pops up after the login screen. Android user.",
        "Had a virtual appointment today that I couldn't attend because the app keeps closing on me!!!!",
        "Even without covid19 causing all these remote visits I love it and wish this will continue in the future. So easy!",
        "Always have trouble logging in I am very discouraged and the support number given is not the correct one",
        "Edit: Used a second time and still am impressed! The Dr was very informative and very nice! He helped me with all my questions and I would totally use again.",
        "I haven't used this app yet, because I just have open the app when I was in Lourdes Memorial Hospital as a patient there.",
        "Timely and efficient service!",
        "Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment",
        "Suck Fest. Worst customer service ever. Save your $.",
        "This experience was good over all. Dr. Joe listen to the symptoms & prescribed me the meds I needed. Thank You!",
        "Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it",
        "Helpful and easy to use",
        "So grateful for this app worked amazing for us!",
        "Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.",
        "Great Experience ! So wished I had the doctor as my primary! Thank you",
        "Answering the same questions week after week is annoying. Covid questions for Virtual Visits?? Seriously??!! People have a .02% of catching it and an even lesser % of it being deadly. Do you really think it's gonna transfer thru a phone? js",
        "App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the \"sent\" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!",
        "Very easy to use and very convenient.",
        "Great app fast reliable and convenient",
        "Was nice to not get out just to answer a few questions.",
        "Quality application provides what I need for virtual appointments",
        "This app was easy to enroll and use!!!",
        "This is a very solid means by which to access online services and care through the Ascension Health System. I use it to see my therapist and it works well. The interface is easy to use and you can speak with primary care providers almost immediately 24 hours a day.",
        "Get to the insurance part and I can't log in since only 4 listed and mine is not. Yey you have to put something in that spot. Uninstaller app. Guess I'll have to call doctor.",
        "I would give 5 stars but for getting timed out 3 times while entering information. Otherwise this was fantastic. The doctor I spoke with was kind, efficient, and patient.",
        "Very convenient! I was waiting on Covid results and did not want to put others at risk. This app helped me to stay quarantined and still make my appointment!",
        "Such a safe experience to get a simple treatment for non emergency issue. Thank you",
        "Honestly, very easy to use. This is a great way to get care as we all try to practice social distancing. I could select from various practitioners (family medicine, pediatrician, etc.) Or choose \"next available\". Five patients were in the shortest queue ahead of me. It took about 90 minutes to be seen. Once my doctor came on, I never felt rushed. Good exam with physician notes/documentation being sent to my email."
