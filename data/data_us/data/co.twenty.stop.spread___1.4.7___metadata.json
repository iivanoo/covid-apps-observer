        "This app is terrible, I have been trying for 3 days to get my results. I installed the app, got the pin #, tried using the pin and it says \"wrong pin.\" I tried twice, b/c it says you will be logged off after 3 tries. So, I started all over, still no luck. I have had two emails stating my results are ready.",
        "I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating",
        "App was incredibly slow to download and install. I have a galaxy 7 and no issues with other apps. My wireless is in the 26M area. Just left the install to the next day. Opened properly on the second try. From there all good. Put in info, got code, got date screen and results. Thanks",
        "Where is my covid 19 test result that I have spent 3 hours searching for. This is a disaster. I can't recommend this site to anyone, because it is a mere waste of time. Why does it take too long a time to figure out what to do to get your results. It makes someone very anxious and leaves you with no option but to call at the place you were tested. I am tired and can't get my results, what a complete waste of time and resources. Why do you guys hide my results until I became too anxious and frustrated.",
        "I cannot even retrieve a pin number. When i request it with my phone number i keep getting a connection error message that pops up. My connection on my phone is good. I have also sent an e mail twice and have gotten no reply.",
        "I gave permission to receive my test results by phone or email. But when I received a message letting me know my results were ready, instead of just informing me of what the results are I had to install this app. Even after installing and verifying my identity, I get a message saying \"No results found.\" Why can't I just get my test results in a text message like I was supposed to? I still don't know if my test was negative or positive. *ETA- Thank you, email sent.",
        "Logged in to get my son's results and it has locked me out and there is no phone # to call to get it u locked. Have been waiting days to get the results now nothing. Not happy.",
        "You can not turn off notifications! Also, pay close attention to the wheel when selecting your birthday, changing numbers also changes the month.",
        "Everything went smoothly. Results were back in a timely manner. The app was easy to use.",
        "After first round of questions the app doesn't give updates, makes you repeat same process each time and when completed questions choices are to edit or cancel. No clear function.",
        "So far everything has been great the only thing I wish is that the test results on the same page and the date that you had your test completed.",
        "It is a good app, easy to use. My only complaint is that after I fill out my school's passport, it still notifies me to complete a healthy together survey every day. I wish the passport counted for both.",
        "It just kept buffering and buffing and nothing more load up it was horrible",
        "10/14 update Utah has moved fully away from the color coding as of the10/13 yet this \"Official State of Utah\" app doesn't show the change at all, this app is a waste of space and tax payer dollars at this point. Original: Just upgraded to Android 11 and am disappointed to see that this app is not currently part of the Google/Apple Exposure Notification System, should be mandatory or Utah needs to get some $$ back.",
        "Wish the app would send notices for the number of cases in the county at a scheduled time not just a map.",
        "This app tells you to get tested for COVID if you have one symptom. Sometimes people have body aches because they did a hard work out. Sometimes people get a sore throat because they are too much sugar. There are other reasons to have some of these symptoms.",
        "I cant even get on the app. It wants me to put in a pin, so when I request one it saids lost connection. This sucks how else do I get my results?",
        "Keeps crashing when I'm trying to take the daily health checkup thing.",
        "App doesn't work once I put my number in it won't leave that screen",
        "Pretty useless. Tells me to quarantine just because I live with someone who's tested positive regardless of how long ago that was.",
        "Why isn't this app integrated with Google and Apple's covid exposure notification system? Please add support for that.",
        "Horrible, checked my results and then could not access my children's results",
        "Received a txt message saying had my results, but app won't work, I enter my pin & it just goes round & round! How am I supposed to get my results?",
        "Wonderful app it's not hard to navigate I love it",
        "Good app, easy to use.",
        "You need to add an option to state nothing has changed since last assessment so you can quickly provide answers. You could even have it show up in the notification as a response. It would really make it much better.",
        "I was sent home after 15 minutes with high blood pressure and chest pain. Just because they decided not to treat me and just do a Covid-19 test. Came back negative what else do you need? Inappropriate to invade negative patients privacy for $ of a contract with FL Advent health hospital. F this app and F Advent health hospital I have always been discriminated by this hospital.",
        "7/4 Developer reached out, and helped me fix it. Working fine now. Original review, 7/2 Finally started contact tracing even though I've had my Bluetooth turned on for a month. Battery started draining like crazy, and it heated up my phone, so I had to turn it off. Bonehead government wasted a lot of money on this worthless app.",
        "Quick and easy app to use.",
        "Getting my results before I go back to work my schedule. Without waiting for \"The Call.\"",
        "Easy and efficient",
        "Doesn't drain battery badly. I think the question \"Have you been tested for Covid19?\", should say \"Have you been tested for covud 19 in the last 20 days?\" Notification for test results come back quicker than my doctor can contact me.",
        "THIS APP IS A MUST!!! It gives me and my family peace of mind. If you are a resident in the state of Utah and want to be part of the solution DOWNLOAD!! When you come into close contact with somebody it makes a note ( not visible to you so Info is kept confidential ) if they get tested at a later date and it comes back positive. You will get alert to go get tested .",
        "The only question is how do we get back in to share our results to medical personnel? The pin only works for 1st time?",
        "Doesn't work. I work at a SNF and all my coworkers are able to get their test results through this app when we're tested (which is often), but it didn't even ask for my birthday so there's no way for me to get my results on it. 10/10 would not recommend, I'm uninstalling it.",
        "This was quickly rolled out, however no serious advertising whatsoever after, therefore no real impact with only a limited user base. Coronavirus is still spreading and could have been mitigated by better contact tracing and aggressive testing.",
        "I entered pin and it won't move",
        "I can't open this on my Android phone.",
        "Great idea and the math and technology behind how it works is fascinating. Helps me feel safer, though it'd be better if people actually used it more.",
        "It's Draining my battery at 45% usage over my other apps and I only use it briefly for one moment of the day. Plus the state of utah isn't using the tracking feature. Please update the app."
