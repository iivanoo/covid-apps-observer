        "Here in monroe, covid is bad. We need a stay at home order, but the governor doesn't have the balls to do it. This app is a good temporary solution though.",
        "This app has changed my life! The day after installing this app, I won the lottery, had Taylor Swift ask me to marry her and the Governor of Hawaii wants to give me an island. I told him I had no way to get there. Well Carnival call me and said I will have one of their cruise ships at my disposal. I think it is a good app.",
        "This is not searchable via Google Play. Please update the settings as soon as possible. People will be looking for it because of the press conference today. Time is of the essence as with all things Covid!!!",
        "The app says to turn on \"CoViD-19 Exposure Notifications\", but that setting says to install a participating app\" to activate it. Hence, it appears the developers missed an android flag to trigger the notification to allow it in Android 10.",
        "So glad to be a part of helping to keep our community safe. Hoping everyone downloads this app.",
        "Great idea! Quick install, givesfull explanation of data use.",
        "Can't download the app I'm from St. James Parish"
