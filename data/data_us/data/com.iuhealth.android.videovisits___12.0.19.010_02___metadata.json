        "I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.",
        "The app is very easy to use and the doctors visit beats going in and waiting in a room where you have the potential to expose yourself to ill patients coming in",
        "Very easy to use. Only had an occasional sound problem but may have been the providers mic.",
        "Great application, very easy process, friendly and professional staff. Would absolutely recommend and use again",
        "Waiting room \"interview \" outside of this app was confusing because it appeared to be a duplicate, not on the device I had my appointment set for.",
        "It was painless and simple. I highly recommend.",
        "Great App so far, clear picture & sound with no echo or pause !!!",
        "Pretty helpful! Didn't know where to start but this really helped me get on a better track.",
        "The visits are wonderful. The wait time is loooooonnnnnggggg. And the app kept putting people in front of me while I waited.",
        "The app didn't allow for multiple prescription entries and the camera function would not zoom or focus on my ID.",
        "Well I can't get connected to it. It said they can't download my ID. I put myself on a wait list with a nurse and never was contacted. I am very frustrated with this whole thing .",
        "Clear, good connection quality, well organized, and good service.",
        "In a season where Covid-19 has changed how we live our lives seeing Doctor Knutson virtually is awesome. Being that I am immunodeficiencent these virtual appointments removes the stress from my life. I highly recommend this to everyone.",
        "Simple and Easy to down load. But be patient there might be a long wait.",
        "Easy to use, great staff. Very efficient",
        "Used it twice in the beginning of the pandemic and in November, both were positive interactions.",
        "Easy to use, fast and efficient.",
        "My first time and the nurse was so helpful and easy to talk to, thank you!",
        "Easy and convenient",
        "Personal, caring and helpful!!!!!!! Highly recommend.",
        "Easy to use and friendly physicians, but you can't use non-IU health plans, so I have to pay $60 per visit.",
        "Unable to download and reinstall. When installed and opening the application the app kept crashing. I'm on the most recent version of Android. No clue why this is happening. It worked a couple months ago.",
        "Great telehealth service.",
        "It was easy to set up and could see and hear my Doctor . There was a part before the appointment to put any information such as picture or anything so your Doctor could see it before the appointment started.",
        "Considering it is new for covid, they do a great job. Took me over 5 hours, however, to get myself and my two children screened for testing.",
        "Good when it works. I waited in multiple \"lines\" got to be the next person and then was told they were no longer accepting patients. They do not send you to another provider. You have to stay over, in a longer line, to maybe have the same problem. I'm still waiting. I was 2nd in line, 3rd in line, now 7th... hoping I won't be dropped this time. Changed to 1 star because I can't do 0. Tried for 2 hours for each if six lines to get to the top and have the provider no longer accepting.",
        "Easy set up and to use! However, there was SOME INTERFERENCE, garbled audio- audio cut out a few times. Annoying, but provider could hear me clearly. Some visual frame freeze but that didn't bother me. Receptionist helped me do initial set up. Not really necessary, but told me which questions I could skip without answering. You just need to remember to \"check in\" 15 minutes prior to appt time to activate app- visit. After that, by chat, I was checked in and nothing else to click or do.",
        "Absolutely love this option! I have depressive episodes which makes it especially challenging to adhere to the normal taking-time-off-to-go-in-to-a-doctor's-office routine. The video and audio was clear, and this was the least disruptive appointment I've ever had, i.e. work time lost was only 15 minutes. This is clearly a wonderful option that deserves to continue past quarantine.",
        "I really appreciated being able to have my appointment online. While I was a little unsure how it would be, it actually felt more like talking with a really knowledgable & helpful friend who knew what advice to give me medically. It was also really encouraging. It took away the waiting room experience & the discomfort of not knowing quite when the doctor would walk in the room. Also, in 20 minutes i had all of the information i needed. Normally I expect in office appointments to take an hour +.",
        "I used my Galaxy phone for my dr visit and the picture was crystal clear!!Great app!! Really great for times when you don't want to go to the actual dr in person. Also keeps you safe from exposure to sick people in dr offices. I would prefer this method unless I have serious concerns that need to be addressed.",
        "This was SO. flippin. easy! My care team is great, but I wouldn't hate it if all med \u2714 appts were virtual! No need for my Glam Squad to come over & work magic on me (As if!!!) \ud83e\udd23 Virtual appts must be easier on your staff, too. Nicholle Hise, NP, is WONDERFUL! I felt heard & cared for. I rolled out of bed 10 mins prior, so I looked like more than a WHOLE hot mess! She was unfazed. I'd love to see her at my 6 mo f/u, if possible? *Can this be shared with her? We all need praise/encouragement \u2764",
        "Spent 30 minutes waiting in the virtual waiting room, only for the app to crash as soon as the doc tried to join. Tried to open the appointment again and it said \"thanks for attending your appointment.\" I get that this is new territory for challenging times, and we're all trying to adapt, but this is not better than just calling me on my cell phone.",
        "Whenever I went to go and use this app for my doctor's appointment it kept freezing in me in the middle of my virtual doctor's visits that just ones if the things that it would do bad while using this app",
        "App is amazing! I knew my Nurse Practitioner. Just like office visit except the fact I'm not spreading my germs and illness to others also I'm not picking up new ones from others! good quality of video. I heard her instructions and questions. Thank you for finally coming into the 21st century!! this is a total game changer for sick people!",
        "The doctor was terrific! And it was very nice not having to go into the doctor especially during this quarantine. However, about six attempts to connect with a doctor last night failed, and the wait time is long anyway. But the convenience of staying home outweighs it, and our doctor was worth the wait.",
        "This App is absolutely wonderful! You can still have appointments with your doctor for conditions you are worried about but not exactly life threatening. I've recently had issues with sciatica and was able to get an appointment within 2 hours of calling the doctors office. My prescription is on the way to the pharmacy as I write this review.",
        "I had problems with this app on first three uses. IU Health tech support was not helpful when the app failed to connect to doctor. Tech said the app should \"just work\" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone. Seems like something tech support should have thought to suggest.",
        "No record of visit, not linked to rest of health record. Have had 2 appointments (one for me and one for my child). Neither appointment exist in my app history. When I log into my Health Portal, these visits don't show. During my visit yesterday the nurse practitioner stated they were transferring prescriptions to my pharmacy. My pharmacy doesn't have them and there is no way to verify the appointment even occurred.",
        "1 star rating because the password requirements are too weak for an application with access to my Healthcare provider. When trying to use special characters, I'm warned that I'm using invalid characters, but the limits are not explained, only the minimum requirements. This is terrible programming and bad documentation/UX UI",
        "Everything went very smoothly. I felt connected to my provider just as though I were in the office. The only thing I would say to improve is putting the pharmacies in alphabetical order and giving an option to type in your Pharmacy if you know it. It was very difficult to go through that long list to find my Pharmacy."
