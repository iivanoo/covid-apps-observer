        "I saw other comments about the digital ID not recognizing them the same day they went to the DMV. I gave it a try after I went in yesterday and got the same error message as everyone else. I gave it another try today and it worked! Looks like it takes a bit of time for their system to update, which is understandable. A government app that kinda works... what a nice surprise! 4 stars!",
        "Such a hard time logging into the app after downloading onto another phone. Facial recognition finally worked after more than 20 attempts. Won't upload my new current fishing/hunting license. If you're able to upload your drivers license than that is all the app is good for. Many places 21+ will not accept damaged ID cards so this app comes in handy if you have a damaged license or ID and need to get in somewhere.",
        "Definitely one star it does recognize or unable to match my selfie with my pic at the DMV I took earlier today. At least it got the Qvr code and the verification by phone (sms) matched. But I cant access my digital copy of my drivers license. Please do something and fix this. I noticed the other recent comments are having the same problem. My phones to nice for this malarkey.",
        "To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.",
        "Tried retaking my picture a good 15 times and it kept saying it couldn't match my photo with my DMV photo. Tried uploading a photo instead but still no luck. I then tried to upload my picture from my ACTUAL license and it still didn't work. So frustrating.",
        "In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.",
        "Completely worthless so far...kinda like cotrip.... was finally able to create login after several failed attempts. Turned on finger print verification and all permissions, but just get stuck forever on \"authentication verified\" page.",
        "This app is no good because every time I try to make an appointment they would not let me make one they would say I had an error so here I see it with no ID and trying to get my ID for a year now and I still can't get it and and it's nothing but BS all they're trying to do is waste time I went down there and they had no one in the line no backup or nothing and I still couldn't get in to get my ID",
        "I installed this app for the digital id and you can't use it without \"authenticating\" with a selfie that is impossible to match to the dmv database. No matter how many pictures I try it won't match to the picture taken by the dmv earlier today, there is no other way to prove I am who I say I am.",
        "Bizarre bug. The camera is not picking up much light. I know it's the app because my camera works in other apps. I was trying to set up my ID which requires a selfie for facial verification. I set up multiple photography lights and it was still way too dark in the app.",
        "I love this app. It took a little time to imput all my info. It is easy to access my information and has good security protocols.",
        "App is good in general, BUT, I HATE the facial recognition and such. Nice to have everything in one place, but not nice to give up things for it",
        "So helpful in tracking multiple vehicles. Love having my driver's license handy AND being able to have a version without all my personal info that I can share with those verifying my over 21ness.",
        "Absolutely love this app, it's so easy to use and the ability to always have access to my ID and now an easier way to show ID to vote.",
        "Will not scan drivers license code and does not give a way to enter this info manually. Tried with two different phones...same result.",
        "S21Ultra. App is unable to use appropriate camera, resulting in an inability to take a picture of my ID, rendering the app useless to me.",
        "Can't Register, worthless. Crashes every time I try and take the photo of my bar code...",
        "Damn camera will not scan the barcode on back of i.d. really frustrating if only I could use this it would save me alot of stress and help me alot at the moment",
        "Used to keep me logged in. Know I have to log in every time and the app has to ping my phone evert time \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd74",
        "A little tricky to get going but when it its going it works good it helps to be in a place that has Wi-Fi",
        "It's great, I'm waiting on receiving my DL on mail and with this app I just show it if I need to.. love it.",
        "(UPDATE: They've fixed all of my previous issues and vastly improved the user interface. If only car dealers accepted the digital DL, then it'd be flawless.) Absolutely useless app. I tried scanning my ID on multiple phones, only to have nothing happen. Tried on my LG, Samsung, Iphone, and tablets with the same result accross all platforms.",
        "Says the server is down when I attempt to create an account. Been doing this for a week and no change.",
        "The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.",
        "As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.",
        "Needs to be able to add antique vehicles. Can't seem to add vehicles with Horseless Carriage plates.",
        "I was notified about this App through the CPW fishing site, I can say as a disabled veteran I found this really easy to learn about.",
        "2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. \ud83d\udc4dWhen this app is working, its amazing.",
        "Now that most of the bugs are worked out, it's great. they do need to do a better job of explaining that the picture it takes is for facial recognition to prove that you're the person on your ID and not that it's taking a new picture for the ID.",
        "Great App! But, periodically wont let me log in.",
        "MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.",
        "I think this is great. I love being able to switch out what info is visible on my ID. I just wish when I tried to use it, the other person didn't think I was tricking them.",
        "The facial recognition won't recognize my face. I just took my new photo for my ID TODAY, I don't look any different. I literally took a picture of my face on my new ID and it STILL won't recognize me. This is useless if I can't use it. Why use facial recognition in the first place? Thumb print is good enough for anything else.",
        "This app is awesome! It's a must have for everyone who wants the convenience of having your CO State ID or Driver's License on your phone. There's no way you can lose it when it's at the touch of your fingertips!!",
        "Nice but missing alot .. good luck businesses excepting it !",
        "I've tried all day to get my stuff and it will not take a pic of my face to verify. Very sad.",
        "This app is great! Question: can we add our covid-19 vaccination record card to this app? And 2nd form of ID, such as military ID?",
        "I was so excited to download this app only to be shut out EVERY TIME I TRY TO SCAN MY ID! Please iron out the kinks and I will be sure to come back for a 5 star review.",
        "I'm sure it's a great site, but it does not let me create a site with my California DL.",
        "Whatever issues with the march update isn't affecting my use. Love it and super easy to use!!"
