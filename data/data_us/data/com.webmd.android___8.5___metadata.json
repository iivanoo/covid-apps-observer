        "This was updated. Since then, I can't save my medications on the check interactions. We use to be able to do that. Save our medications. That helped me a lot. It helped me remember what not to take together. I have about a dozen medications that I take. I was really liking this. The medication you added, was there until you would delete it. Now, that's not a option at all. What's the clear all needed for, if medications don't get saved. Now, I hate it.",
        "The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating",
        "Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.",
        "No notifications after 2 weeks uninstall and reinstall not helped had to download another pill reminder app to track my pills instead shame as webmd is a good app",
        "I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.",
        "This app sucks, its slooow, buttons work at random, when they decide to work at all, I couldn't even get far enough in the app to completely describe my ailments. I DON'T RECOMMEND!! I uninstalled immediately after this review.",
        "Do not get this app. YOU WILL BE SPAMMED. I am receiving daily emails. Tried to unsubscribe, but the emails still keep coming. I will be deleting this app",
        "I really love this app its help me out more way than I would have thought its awesome \ud83d\udc4c",
        "I love how it elaborate and explain. Its not just helpful but learning.",
        "Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.",
        "I have found that searching for certain terms, such as \"dementia\", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",
        "Don't download, you'll get daily spamming. They don't accept unsubscribe.",
        "Wanted to learn about possible thyroid problem and got a lousy quiz instead. What a joke!",
        "I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled",
        "A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!",
        "Terrible service ..trouble diagnosing problem or illness",
        "This is such an app for info on medical anything. Including identifying pills that you find in your cabinet and can't remember or know what it is.",
        "poorest symptom tracker, really irritating. even it cant find acne and pain? better you developers remove this fraud app, or make a proper diagnosis algorithm,, really hate your app.",
        "It's easy to find the right information you wand plus ways of helping you and showing ways to exercise to help with the problem 1 It gets my vote",
        "many symptoms lacking especially related to brain and psychiatry.",
        "Too many ads",
        "Probably the least helpful app I've ever used",
        "Good information and podcasts are good.",
        "Tried to give me results before I even have a chance to explain the symptoms. Useless",
        "Useless app! What use is it when it doesnt specify all the diseases known to man. Found it useless when i searched for a common illness without any single result of my search. Moreover, you must choose the required number of illness before you complete your medical check. Nonsense! What use is it? Make a better service instead!",
        "Symptom checker seldom works properly. You're better off going to Google.",
        "I couldn't find some of the meds I take. I'm not sure if this app is aware of Canadian medicine terms and generic drug names. Uninstalled.",
        "Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.",
        "Permanent Email Spam. Literally sent hundreds of messages telling them to quit sending email. Regardless of the number of times you unsubscribe, or tell them to stop, these clowns continue to send it loads of messages. A situation I find completely unacceptable. So for me, it is pure trash.",
        "It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays",
        "Always get the straight scoop",
        "Tried to use the symptom checker but I couldn't even enter knee pain as an option. All of the preselected options were covid-19 symptoms! If this is all that is offered, the symptom checker can be trashed.",
        "Complete trash. I type in painful numb swollen feet the only suggestions you offered was swollen testicles what the heck",
        "The old online symptom checker would let you select an area on the body where you had pain. If only the app did, too. This app makes you type in what specific organ/part is causing pain. Well... I don't know specifically where it's coming from. The list they had to choose from didn't seem to apply, anyway. The old online format would then ask additional questions to narrow results down. This app only asked me one question that didn't really get me anywhere.",
        "Great app for getting an idea about medical conditions you may be experiencing. What happened to the visual selection? The one with the picture of the human? I'd much rather select a body part than type and scroll through a list of words. Might work for some people, but I prefer the visual aspect of that selection method. Please bring it back... Just as an additional option. Why take it out?",
        "I only need reminders for meds and supplements. This app only allows you to select pre-set brand name pharmaceuticals. Cannot add your own custom items (such as Cucurmin or Alpha-Lipoic Acid). Also, reminder notifications are not aggressive enough. People with cognitive issues such as Alzheimer's or ADHD will most likely fail to take their meds. The app needs to repeat popup reminders until the user acknowledges taking their scheduled dosage.",
        "this app used to be great. It would give you an avatar to select the affected areas, and a very extensive list of symptoms. It would then have follow up questions about the symptoms you chose. Now you must enter it all manually, and there are no follow up questions. In my opinion, this used to the best symptom checker available, but now it's just garbage.",
        "Honestly, I miss the old symptom checker. It seemed to be more accurate. This new form says (Over Exaggeration) that I died 7 years ago. I know nothing beats a living breathing medical professional, but none happen to be open today (Sunday) with out going to ER. In my profession, Saturday and Sunday are just days when no one's around.",
        "I miss the old symptom checker interface. I mostly used this app to help figure out the vocabulary of the parts involved with my symptoms but now I don't have a place to start. I also do not like all the added features, I have separate apps for those and it's creating clutter on my device. I'd rather have an app that does one thing well than a bunch of things poorly.",
        "This is a very helpful app to have on hand. It's versatile to many ailments and conditions. Saves a trip to the Dr or at least gives you symptons you can arm yourself with before going. Especially where children are concerned. I use it for my grown daughters and their grown kids. A must have app."
