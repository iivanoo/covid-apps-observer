        "An amazing application. This is perfect. I used this service instead of entering a clinic to keep myself away from any infectious pathogens. The app is easy to use. The Doc was amazing. And this was so sufficient. Thank you so much.",
        "I'm not able to get on the screen to make appointments. And I'm being told by MetroPlus that \"it is what it is\" . I should go in person they say. But they keep emailing me to make virtual visits \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Poor service MetroPlus",

        "Works very well",
        "This was surprisingly easy to use! Though I couldn't get it to work really late at night and had to wait till morning, so I don't think it's really 24/7 the way I thought it would be",

        "Dr. Sandy wiita is wonderful with added fantastic bedside manners. She made the experience feel as if you were in her actual practice/office. I would highly recommend this app to others. Thank you doctor wiita you were a sweetheart and i appreciate your time and information.",
        "I just downloaded the app and everything was really fast and easy to set up. Overall extremely helpful and comfortable.",
        "Very easy to use was able to get the help I needed in one virtual visit.",

        "Very easy to do and had a great experience with the doctor that was selected.",
        "The doctors on this app are amazing and informative saved my life",
        "The wait was long. Overall excellent experience",
        "Love it convenient and reliable",
