        "I have used the Virtual Visit service three times this year and each time was easy, private and efficient. I had a different provider each time and they have all been wonderful-- very compassionate, patient and knowledgeable.",
        "Handy but still buggy",
        "Incredibly convenient. It just saved me an hour drive and untold time sitting in urgent care just to have a care provider take a peek at me. I'm a believer after just one e-visit. If it's something that a high resolution photo and a brief description of symptoms could handle this is the ticket. Doctor was very through and set appropriate expectations. Also you get to pick from a list of available doctors and you are able to review their basic credentials on there biography page. Mind blown...",
        "Very easy to use. I had called the Hospital and with COVID-19 I did not have to leave my house. I will use this again. It beats waiting at urgent care, having to drive in, and they send meds if needed. Ea as y to upload pictures and the Dr. can view with your phone camera to examine the area.",
        "During this time of uncertainty, my virtual visit was awesome!! I had a nice clear connection with my provider who was great. She was able to look at my chart during our visit all while I was comfortably at home",
        "My provider was great! Everything went smooth and she was very understanding and helpful! I appreciate this app SO MUCH with having 3 SMALL kids at home this was the way to go! Thank you!",
        "This is the third time I've used it. Awesome!",
        "Quick, easy, and makes getting to the doctor's really accessible for anyone !",
        "Quick easy, and far less time than going to the emergency room...this time. : )",
        "Exceptional, easy to use",
        "Fast and easy",
        "Outstanding"
