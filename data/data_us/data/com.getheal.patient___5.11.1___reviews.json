MDs were attentive and very detailed when discussing things (lab work results, diagnosis, care plan) and no one feels rushed.  This app / service saves me a ton of time driving to and from a Dr.'s office, Checking in with the receptionist, validating insurance coverage and the most dreaded grief of waiting.. waiting... and waiting at the lounge with other patients.

With this app I had a doctor on the way to my place within under an hr. The doctor was really friendly and let me know what I needed to do to relieve my symptoms. It was so nice not having to travel to a Dr's office and wait when I could have one come to my home. I would imagine this would be really great for families with kids, too!",
