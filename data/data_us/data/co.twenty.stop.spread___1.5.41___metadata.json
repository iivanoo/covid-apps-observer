    "comments": [
        "For anyone who happens to have a cellphone number with an area code of one of the territories of the US, remember to change your region to that territory. Keeping your region as United States will result in the app being unable to accept your number. This minor frustration aside, the app was sleek and easy to use. Nicely done.",
        "I had to give you my cell phone and get updates for a one-time thing. I want to use stronger terms but I wont. Now I'm going to unload this app..Perhaps I was hasty...I still don't like all the stuff, just to get a result. And some people do not have cell numbers...",
        "Worthless app, this should just be a website. No I have to download a application just to get my test results when I could just be sent a simple url to view them... Everything does not need to be an app!",
        "So easy to use! I got a text message, downloaded an app & from there put my phone number, name & dob and boom! There were my results. Wish everything was that simple",
        "Cannot change birth year. Awful. Need to check my test result and can't! Have tried changing the birth year first, and every other way. It does not work. Reinstalling the app changes nothing either. Please help!",
        "They send you a code to enter ,but there's no way to continue? You enter the code ,hit enter & nothing happens? Hopefully this isn't some type o f bug or virus?",
        "This app is worthless. No stupid ENTER or SUBMIT button for the verification code, only a tab button that just cycles through the spaces where you enter the code. How the hell are people supposed to get their results?!",
        "I'm trying to get the code so I can see my results but keep showing an error. I'm flying today and need this fix asap",
        "I love that the app is simple even a child can use it and keeps past and present results",
        "Cannot select birthdate. Scroll bar keeps going back to 2001 or 2021. Uninstall.",
        "I stopped registering after the app required me to enter my device password. Not cool. I saw another comment say the same thing and the app denied it saying it was requesting the pin. I already entered the pin at this point and it will not let me continue unless I give my device password. Update after developer response: I already entered the texted pin when it explicitly asked for my device password",
        "Recent update broke ability to view results because date of birth can't be changed from year 2001. Will revise review when fixed. Update: the developers instruction does fix the DOB entry problem but it really should not be so complicated. The previous DOB interface was frustrating as well but it did work. Not sure why it is so complicated. Upgrading to three stars as most people still won't be able to figure out the DOB trick.",
        "App is not working. I enter my information and it keeps giving me an error message saying \u201csomething went wrong. Please try again\". The birth dates are correct, but it still doesn't work. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if it would fix it. Nothing!",
        "Very good app! Functions as described! Thank you very much developers for creating something like this! It is greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude42!",
        "Great site and very fast with no issues. Definitely 5 stars",
        "I'm annoyed. Got a message my results were available, but I had to download an app. When I finally got to request the results. Zip. No results available! Grr",
        "the professionals there are wonderful and kind and thorough. but they are working so hard and could use more staff just like them. here in Palm Coast they are extremely busy",
        "Hasn't updated records since 02/2021. There is no \"together\" in apps records or calls to find out why!",
        "Just downloaded it. Keeps asking to verify a code. I get the code, punch it in and nothing. I try again and nothing. I think they sent it 5 times and still I can't hit next. Already Uninstalled it.",
        "Quickly installed and it works perfectly. Saw my results from the tests I've taken, type of test, and date taken. Thank you for this app.",
        "great app, I enjoy the way it \u2714\ufe0f me everyday, I'll be telling my family about the app so they can stay safe and healthy until our country is back to normal.",
        "Would not let me change birth year. Did receive fast support text saying I heeded to enter year first, which I did and then it worked. They have a fix planned for next revision.",
        "Can not get past the basic enter your phone number screen to continue. There's no regular website to check just the app and it doesn't work.",
        "The app was simple to use. It literally took 1 min to see results after I downloaded the app.",
        "You need to put TEST RESULTS date on the test. Because of this I was unable to fly international even though I was negative and in compliance of the 72 hr period.",
        "Hi I did my test and now I can't log into the app to view it. It's asking for a pin, I tried my DOB that didn't work. I am so frustrated. Please help.",
        "The app ask you for your phone to register and then nothing happens; no results, no registration, just nothing... Another company scamming the government with tax payers money.",
        "the Health care workers were in the community the test were done it was an easy process and the results were send to my phone and it were free. I were very grateful for the test.",
        "free app, doesn't require a lot of space, gives the info needed, and seems to never crash.",
        "This is my 2nd attempt over 2 weeks to try to download this app Message error says oops something went wrong try later",
        "It took over 5 minutes to send a pin, I requested another and never was sent. Typical we anything associated with the government.",
        "I have great services and information about my procedures, this is very much better than waiting on hold, this app I'm sure is better for the staff as well. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00",
        "Works beautifully for me, and really helps to have a record of my tests available in one spot due to my unfortunate need to travel.",
        "So I'm just going to assume someone would call me if I'm positive. At first I couldn't change my birthdate. And now I can, but I can't press the confirm button because it's blocked by my home key and the app doesn't rotate. A year into this, there's no excuse that this app is so bad.",
        "Fast and clean all options are tested.",
        "Not only did I have to download it would not take pin. Still no results.",
        "Prompts for sign in every use. How is this effective for contact tracing when it doesn't activate the option in settings? Daily checkups aren't able to be responded to from notification quick response.",
        "I type the phone number the request pin button never enables and no error message is shown. Did anybody test this?",
        "Wow. This App works great. Very simple and smart. Thank you!!\ud83d\ude18// Esta App trabaja excelente. Muy sencilla e intuitiva. Gracias!!!",
        ". .horrible experience! After 1/2hour trying to put in my birth year,it never worked! I needed to see my covid test results! App is not working!"
