With iBlueButton, you have in your hands at all times your medical information to better manage your healthcare, avoid preventable medical errors, and receive safer and more effective care. \r\n\r\niBlueButton won the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button\u00ae program, to give Americans the ability to access their Blue Button health records. iBlueButton was the first native mobile application approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Americans covered by Medicare to make use their Medicare Blue Button data to receive safer healthcare. iBlueButton is also one of only four applications approved by the VA for Veterans to access their VA health records and has been partner of the VA since 2011, and in 2021 iBlueButton was the first mobile application approved by Humana.\r\n\r\nFor Medicare and Humana beneficiaries along with their approved caregivers, iBlueButton lets you login into your account at MyMedicare.gov or Humana and retrieve your medical history. Your health information is automatically translated on your phone or tablet from your Medicare or Humana claim  information into an organized medical history in all of its useful details. \r\n\r\nWhen accessing VA or your other healthcare provider health records, iBlueButton additionally displays your lab results in organized lab panels with indication of normal ranges and graphs so that you can see lab value trends overtime. To get more information for each laboratory test, iBlueButton provides one-tap look ups through Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of Medicine. \r\n\r\n- ALL IN YOUR HANDS\r\niBlueButton pulls and organizes multiple records into a single Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections (medications, conditions, laboratory test results, etc.) and your detailed medical history (physician visits, hospitalizations, etc.). This Summary Record is available at all times to review, research, share, print and annotate critical health information. iBlueButton\u2019s on device architecture fosters privacy and security and allows for data to be accessible even if you are not connected to the Internet.\r\n\r\n- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS\r\nWhether it is about the medications you currently take, a new one recently prescribed, an existing condition, or new medical condition iBlueButton automatically generates safety warnings and best care practices based on well-established guidelines. iBlueButton now also offers COVID-19 related alerts, including an alert if you are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, and an alert about eligibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\n- LIFE AND COST SAVING\r\nOn average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians and most of the time any one of these physicians will not have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel and their families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place not only in VA and military health facilities, but also in the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.\r\n\r\n- SECURE AND PRIVATE\r\nUnlike most personal health applications, iBlueButton stores your information securely encrypted on your own mobile device. Under your sole control, your personal health information is retrieved by your app from the data source and goes directly on your mobile device where it is securely stored.
