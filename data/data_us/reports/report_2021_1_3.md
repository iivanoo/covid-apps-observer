The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This picks up most of the places I go, and I check when I get home so I can add places it has missed or change inaccurate locations, which only happens when I am in an area with a lot of stores, like a plaza. My home state has not chosen an app so I use this one.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 22:03:28__

> I just dont have room on my phone:(<br> :date: __2020-07-06 11:55:41__

> Remember this is for north & south Dakota only.. other states will may add their state if they choose too. It will show other states but will not guarantee it at this time<br> :date: __2020-06-20 21:46:43__

> The early release back in April was rough (didn't log any stops for me). But it's been working well for me since about May 4. It occasionally logs more than one stop at the same location. It occasionally gets the name of the location wrong, but this is very easy to correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 06:25:30__

> You should be able to type in a location when it gets it wrong. Sometimes there is no option for where you are.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 06:04:00__

> After multiple attempts, this app cannot determine my home location. Uninstalling. UPDATE 10/21/20 - It can now find my home location. Up to 3 stars. I do not see how I can see the list of locations myself.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 15:32:52__

> Every couple of weeks it takes a day off & doesn't show any locations at all for that day.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 02:59:05__

> How long do the places you visit stay on the app? Mine seem to show maybe only previous 10 days.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 23:41:30__

> Doesn't this app use the Contact Tracking System that Apple and Google developed?<br> :date: __2020-06-02 15:29:17__

> Simple app. Does what it was designed for but little else. Misses many locations and frequently has location accuracy issues. Routinely misses my home by 6 blocks. Says I have visited locations I have just driven past. Would be nice to have ability to add locations that I visited but app failed to record.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 15:52:32__

> Still isn't capturing places I've been. Was at 3 different locations today, and not one of them showing up.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 23:03:13__

> Very inconsistent with location. Can be at a location for hours and doesn't list it.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 15:20:52__

> It's a great idea, but does not log most of the places I've been. Stopped at 6 places in Bismarck and didn't log one place. And then the next time it will log the same place 4 times within a few minutes or log a place I only drove by.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 02:20:12__

> Each week, 2 out of the 5 days I'm at work there's no entry. Yesterday it showed me in the middle of road halfway to work for 8.5 hours. If I stop somewhere on my way home from work, half the time it misses it. I have a Pixel 3 XL. I want to have this app work.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:21:53__

> App runs unnoticeably in the background. However, requires constant maintenance. If I go more than 2-3 days without monitoring the app, I find that it stops tracking my locations, at which point I need to go back through all intro screens as if I just installed the app (Region, Consent, Home location, etc). Back arrow on Android while in the Places You've Visited will also return to the initial menu and require passing through all intro screens again, or app will not resume tracking. Should have a warning, and consent/home location should be saved in a more permanent cache.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:23:18__

> Doesn't catch all locations, and it recorded a one hour visit to one store as 12 minutes, then would not allow correction.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:10:23__

> Quit recording anything after about three weeks.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 05:30:54__

> Inaccurate didn't track me for days sometimes. Uninstalled it, that bad.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 03:31:36__

> Location info is incorrect and incomplete. I was able to fix the incorrect info, but can't add locations. Uninstalled and reinstalled on 6/24. Tracked my location until 6/27 then nothing.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 17:28:05__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light. Some days it gives no information at all.. i reloaded it a couple of weeks ago. It worked well until July 3 then quit working, not registering any locations.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 20:23:07__

> Idk procedure to get my phone to let this work automatically in the background, out on the east coast<br> :date: __2020-07-02 20:56:10__

> It's not all that<br> :date: __2020-06-18 15:59:46__

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

> Not accurate very often. Going to delete as it is more trouble than keeping a written log.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 21:22:35__

> Poorest design. Does not "track" movement via gps, does not allow quick add (referencing gps) feature. Does not have "end at home". Thus know how long.. at one location or unable to determine greater than 20 mph driving. Becomes indicator leaving location.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 04:32:05__

> Edit: 8.10.20 Still same problems. If battery saver is issue, fix it. Update 6.27.20 - Tou can tell the developer(s) doesnt even use this app or they would know what we are talking about. You say it's just the way it is, no, you know how it's supposed to work, so find someone to make it work correctly. This app does not trace where I been going. It does not stay open in the background. When open, it does not show where I go or been since the 23rd. I restarted phone and reinstalled app on S9+<br> :date: __2020-08-11 03:56:40__

> Uninstall. I didn't put it in<br> :date: __2020-08-04 19:20:34__

> Doesn't do anything that Google Maps My Timeline can't do better. Maybe in a state with a competent health department it could. As I understand it in incompetent SC, it won't even do Bluetooth ID exchanges with other devices for contact tracing.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 01:57:38__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is a must have app! Download and check it out for a month or two. This is one app that will always be on my phone!<br> :date: __2020-12-07 08:19:38__

> Seems to be pretty decent. I live in Texas, so I already have apps for weather/tornado warnings. This app has alerts for other life threatening things like disease and nuke power plant failures. I watch less and less TV these days, without this app I might not know about these other alerts. It's simple to use, and thankfully, seldom used. Lets all hope it stays that way. Thanks for the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 21:12:50__

> So I love this app, but I feel as if you guys should check the reviews. There are people there with legitimate concerns, and some great recommendations that your should take look at. Such as: -Missing Alerts -A "Follow Me" option. -A priority alert mode (that fully covers your screen when you get a warning alert). I had a tornado warning in my area, and I love that I recieved it when using the app, but you should force the users to see a warning. These are the 3 options I'd love to see come.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 03:51:39__

> It has a lot of information anyone would ever need in this nation you could help you self and others in anything<br> :date: __2020-11-25 07:22:21__

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Great app !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 02:06:16__

> Overall decent, but I don't need 17 alerts in one hour for the same storm.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 01:10:21__

> It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 22:57:25__

> Fast reliablie services<br> :date: __2020-07-09 01:04:27__

> Great app.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 08:50:11__

> Great at giving alerts for different areas. Live posting during storms is excellent. Just be careful you don't list to many places to avoid constant updates.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 03:22:06__

> Works but would multiply the same alerts<br> :date: __2020-10-03 19:46:59__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a "no wifi" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 18:35:21__

> Not enough details on alerts. Not worth the space on my phone<br> :date: __2020-09-11 00:11:01__

> Difficult to navigate and doesn't provide info I expected<br> :date: __2020-09-06 08:45:22__

> The type is thinner and less legible with this update. The unnecessary style change reduces its usefulness to me. Plus, I have not received alerts about the smoke in my area or the fires near me although I specified that in the settings. So I uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 06:13:51__

> Super irregular performance and notifications. I cannot rely on this for requested information or results<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:22:01__

> Need more control over types of alerts. Don't need to be woken from deep sleep at 3 am for fog warning, for instance. Fog won't harm me when safe in bed in sturdy house unless I hurt myself being startled in my sleep by loud notification.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:17:51__

> No change. Even after clearing cache, rebooting phone, etc still getting multiples of same exact alerts and several alerts with little or no lead time. That's probably FEMA but still downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 22:38:27__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> What is it with this app. I've.been trying to download it for three days how long does it take to for it to download .we are about to be hit with a hurracain.this is messed.up<br> :date: __2020-08-23 03:40:24__

> It really does do absolutely nothing. Not even sure why i have it<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:16:55__

> Alerts are way too excessive.. It's a little windy in my area and I get notifications what feel like every 5 minutes. Had to delete the app because it was so annoying.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 21:47:54__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

It's a proven fact that masks work. Wake up and stop being so bull headed...I've been trying to do everything that has been recommended by our Governor and have been using this app since the first day it came out.

> more f<br> :date: __2020-08-06 01:07:34__

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> This seams to not be accurate very often with locations!!<br> :date: __2020-10-14 23:37:32__

> It puts me places I never was<br> :date: __2020-10-14 16:40:06__

> I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the "No thanks" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:12:33__

> This should be integrated with the exposure notification system from Apple and Google. Without it, this app exists in its own tiny silo and won't be successful.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 05:33:30__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 01:24:33__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

> Rarely works<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:46:15__

> I appreciate this app so much that I've kept it on my phone pretty much since day 1, and have let it log my location for the chance that I catch COVID-19 and want to send it in. I just want to do anything I can to help stop the spread. However, this app accounts for 35 PERCENT of my battery usage. There's simply no need for an app to be that power-hungry, just logging my location idly. That, and the fact that it doesn't integrate Google's contact tracing technology, I have to say goodbye for now<br> :date: __2020-11-19 08:27:43__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> Deleted immediately. Way too many permissions, microphone & other permissions are more than what is needed. Buggy. Google is awful.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 05:09:34__

> I have the app installed but my region of Arizona isn't listed. The statewide reporting isn't up and running so I can't choose that as a region. I guess I am left out in the heat on this one. I will update to higher stars once the reporting becomes available in places besides two university regions.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 00:50:40__

> This app only works for UofA & NAU and isn't on the CDC's list so trying to find it is challenging. What are the developers waiting for, especially with the current spike in Arizona? It dosen't do any good to share this with others if no one can add there positive diagnosis in an unsupported region (meaning the rest of the state).<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:02:59__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:19:06__

### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

> My problem is that in the DC area folks from DC, Maryland, Virginia mix regularly and then we have people from all over the country coming in. But it seems I can only have one contact app enabled at a time, and as best I can tell that means I wouldn't get notified if my phone had been getting chirps from someone on a different app. Am I incorrect?<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:52:47__

> Good idea, flawed execution. A person who tests positive must input a PIN that they receive from a state contact tracer to report their illness. This works great as long as the contact tracing is performed properly. Personal experience: my wife tested positive, did not hear from a contract tracer, never received a PIN. At no point did the app indicate that I had been exposed, even though I share a home with someone who tested positive. This may be an isolated case, but I've lost confidence.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 01:38:46__

> Nice idea but it needs more work. I had this app for a couple of months now and have not got any type of alert for possible exposure. As an essential deliver driver, this app should had alerted me at least 5 times now. I have delivered to a home that was tested positive and never get an alert about it.

> I want to like this because it seems like a great contact tracing tool but I had to enter a building with people who have tested positive for COVID and are in isolation for work.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health |
| **Website**  | [http://dpbh.nv.gov/](http://dpbh.nv.gov/) |
| **Email** | help@covidtrace.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Nevada+Division+of+Public+and+Behavioral+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Nevada+Division+of+Public+and+Behavioral+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>GET_TASKS** | Deprecated | This constant was deprecated in API level 21. No longer enforced.

> It's great, just more people need to get the app to make it even better and more effective. Only 50k downloads. Nevada as a population of over 3 million.

> Kind of a pointless app when after your test positive literally no one that contacts you knows the code necessary to self report.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 05:05:47__

> I mean, sure, I suppose it'd work, but let's be real. The chances of anyone between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies actually self-reporting is kind of on the low end. This makes the app basically useless. Something like it in Korea, that'd work fine, since they take contact tracing seriously<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:02:59__

> Couldn't reload app to get time and day to reload.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:27:23__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> Requires having Bluetooth on at all times which drains my battery. It also keeps giving me drop down notifications even though I disabled notifications. I have an android.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 17:34:36__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

> Absolutely useless if you don't have a specific 8 digit code to confirm the test results. The lab my husband got tested at used code numbers longer than 8 digits. When his test came back positive, there was no way to report it to this app. I don't know if this app is limited to NV Health dept tests or what.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 06:15:07__

> I now understand why I never got an alert even though I live in a hotspot. I tested positive and tried to notify, but it requires a diagnosis code that is never given. There is no workaround, so no way it can be activated.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 20:14:33__

> Good idea poorly executed<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:37:24__

> Downloaded the app about two weeks ago worked fine, I assume the first couple days. Now it will never reload information (it has a little time last updated at the top) it's been stuck at the same time no matter what I do. I like the idea of this but it's basically an app that is a website with tracking permissions. All the clickable stuff in the app just take you to a webpage through your internet app.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 04:27:04__

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible. The idea of this app was good; however, it is only as good as the data that is inputted and shared to others. If there's a breakdown in getting the data into the app and out to everyone else, then it doesn't matter how great your app was stuctured.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:58:00__

> I've had this app on my phone for months hoping that it was a helpful tool to alert people to possible exposures but now I see there is a serious problem with it. I tested positive for Covid-19 today and thought I might be able to help people out by letting them know they may have been exposed but unfortunately it asks for a "verification code" that is nowhere to be found on my test results. Having no idea where to get the code I can't even notify people. Potential to slow the spread wasted.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 06:05:07__

> Downloaded this app immediately when it became available. It was a great concept, if it worked. But it never did. Never got one report of proximity to infected person (even though I was), doesn't refresh most of the time, and drains the battery because you have to keep the Bluetooth on. I'm uninstalling it because it's just taking up valuable storage space and battery usage. So disappointed.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 02:50:14__

> When I downloaded the App I assumed it would notify me of exposures. It never did. The App does not update and no matter where I go store, mall, movies, etc it doesn't connect or work. There is a serious flaw.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 09:43:12__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Delaware Department of Health and Social Services |
| **Website**  | [https://de.gov/covidalert](https://de.gov/covidalert) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less.

### Description
> CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Palm Beach County, Florida, a diverse community of over a million and a half people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Palm Beach County BoCC |
| **Website**  | [https://combatcovidapp.com/pbc](https://combatcovidapp.com/pbc) |
| **Email** | info@combatcovidapp.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My husband downloaded combat covid a few days ago to try it out. He said that it was easy so I did it last night. I have had it running and no problems so far. I also like it has a lot of information for the people in palm beach to read about the disease. Thank you to the county for giving us this. I am going to show friends – well tell them I am not seeing anybody these days.<br> :date: __2020-08-15 16:42:08__

> Kudos to the county for making this available for use. Can’t tell yet what needs to be improved.  It was an easy and fast install but I did have to read it carefully to see what it was doing but it doesn’t look like other apps.  Not sure what I could say to fix that though.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:50:19__

> The user interface needs help! I accidentally marked myself covid positive by clicking a tab, it have a warning that did not ask me if I was covid positive but instead asked if I wanted to upload my information. That is really unclear. I could find no way to undo this mistake. Reply to the response from the developer: At the time i reviewed it, the "3 step process" was definitely not a clearly defined clearly labeled 3 step process for marking yourself positive. Hopefully it has changed.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 04:39:13__

> This app still needs help. Like others, I also accidentally marked myself positive. There needs to be a way to edit that. Plus it sent me a verification code, but didn't wait for me to enter it. It just accepted me.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 20:03:22__

Apparently none of them had this app. Even if they had alerted positive, I would not had gone into quarantine or been tested because I have taken all of the necessary precautions and then some. I no longer see any reason to drain my battery for this app. It is past time to uninstall. 1,500,000 people in PBC. Less than 2,000 downloads = .001% using app. Useless<br> :date: __2020-10-05 16:02:29__

> PBC corrupt mayor and commission paid $800k for this turd app that violates all your rights to privacy, HIPPA, and ACA. $800k could hire a team of 8 top notch developers for a year! Investigate this fraud and the MaskGate fraud as well. When you get your mask in mail from PBC make sure to get a sharpy, write a message on it, and send back! Turn PBC Republican in November and lock up all these criminal Tyrants! (Seems BoCC is worried about the facts!)<br> :date: __2020-08-18 13:35:13__

> Read the fine print of the user agreement VERY carefully! If you agree to it: you give up ALL of your rights. Advertised as not transmitting private information, yet it still has functionality to do so, and the agreement says they can whenever they want! Considering sensitivity of subject, potential for abuse, and waiving all rights in order to use this: one should avoid at all cost! Edit: read agreement and decide for yourself – you waive all your rights! Shield's reply is disingenuous at best.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 17:11:24__

### Description
> Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. 
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple’s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. 
<br>Care19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. 
<br> 
<br>The downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.


### User interface

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I love the concept of this app, but major issues needing addressed. Functionality of my device (android) slowed to near unusable, it was very "buggy" ie: Device would freeze up, apps closed without warning or would not open at all! Device shut down or restarted spontaneously, battery drained incredibly fast, plus any available memory was used sometimes within minutes so that I had to go through each installed & factory app to dump cache 2-3 times DAILY.

### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert](http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Needs a refresh option. I would like to know if there is known exposure after leaving the store. I found scrolling to the bottom of last updated option, a dozen times, refreshes the scan time, but that's not guarantee.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:41:25__

> I give it 4 stars needs improvement . but still great app.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:38:23__

> For the first ten days I had this installed Exposures were checked 2 - 3 times each day. As of this review, the last time Exposures were checked was four days ago. I've verified all settings on the phone as directed by the app. I've force stopped and restarted the app. Nothing seems to get it to begin checking exposures again. If not checking for exposures, what is the purpose of the app? Update:. Oddly shortly after posting the above, the app started updating exposures at least twice daily.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 23:05:53__

> I will if it ever downloads, still pending After 5 Minutes, tried again a few days later and it downloaded right away<br> :date: __2020-12-04 05:11:59__

> Sits quietly in the background doing it's thing with no battery degradation. Like to see a tab to show vaccination verification because eventually schools, businesses, concerts, theaters, airlines, etc will want to see proof of vaccination.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:55:30__

> So far I havent seen anything about exposures. It would be good if they told me how my county and town is doing.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:31:22__

> Just checking it out<br> :date: __2020-11-20 08:58:10__

> Way to late and unlikely to work universally (eg. with folks from out of state) but it's better than the nothing burger we've had so far. Would be nice if it gave you an idea of how many contacts it recorded (Inna privacy preserving way) to let us know the adoption rate around us.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 03:59:58__

> I think the concept of this app is a step in flattening the curve but unless all Michiganders are downloading and using this how is its effectivenes Therefore, I think requirement of the app by all with smart phones or access might make it more successful, not only Michigan but throughout the United States. Matter of fact Everywhere this is a "Global Pandemic". Pre-installment (as other widely used apps are already installed on new phones) is a good idea as well. Please Consider<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:46:35__

### Description
> CombatCOVID MDC app is for Miami-Dade County coverage.
<br>CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Miami-Dade County, Florida, a diverse community of over 2.7 million people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.

> The app is built on old technology. The app needs to be open in order to detect other phones. It does not run in the background, so if you forget to open it before you leave home, it is useless. Not good for such a critical app. Google and Apple built Covid apps to run in the background but this one does not.

### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Alabama Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | alabamapublichealth@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [201 Monroe Street Montgomery, Alabama 36104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/201%20Monroe%20Street%20Montgomery,%20Alabama%2036104) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When trying to report test results, it only says "Server Failure" and won't allow them to be reported. Makes me very skeptical about others being able to report positive tests and alert others. This app has one very important function and it's failing to do its one job.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 00:17:48__

> The app itself was easy enough to set up.

> I just wish more people used it. I kinda feel like it is not useful since people have to opt in for each aspect... BUT I will keep using it as long as this pandemic drags on. Update: This app is a fail. :( Very disappointed but not surprised at this point. It just stopped updating early Dec. Then 2 days ago it locked my phone up downloading. I had to force close & uninstall to stop it from locking up my phone. I wish this worked better.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 15:38:52__

> None<br> :date: __2020-11-25 00:11:08__

> Up front everything is bluetooth, bluetooth, bluetooth. Then after install the app demands location, too. Good privacy policy, but I can't leave both bluetooth and location on at all times or my phone would have to stay on the charger 24/7. Maybe my fault for having an old phone. I'll leave it installed and just enable everything as the Austin e demands.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 21:28:03__

> Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American<br> :date: __2020-10-12 15:50:41__

> Works but Annoyed - had this for UAB support, though it kept saying I had been exposed, the problem my phone was charging at the time it said the exposure happened on 2 different days at the same time of day (late Sunday evenings) I didn't go anywhere during those timeframes. It has to be binging off one of my neighbors but I had to quarantine and not attend classes. I've now removed it.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 08:18:57__

> Doesn't seem to work. My wife and I both have this installed. She tested positive, I went through the process of telling the app she was positive. And I never received a notification that I had been exposed. I noticed that her bluetooth was off. I turned it back on, waited a couple of days and tried the notification process again and verified that her bluetooth was still on. I still didn't get an exposure notification.

### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut. It is supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT-DPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health departments.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Phones will record the keys generated by other phones nearby with the app installed. The app will record the:
<br> -  signal strength, and use that  to estimate the distance between devices, 
<br> -  duration of the contact and 
<br> -  date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State DPH or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, and false exposure notifications. CT-DPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CT-DPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CT-DPH to know where or who you are, for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google / Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CT-DPH.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | CT Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | [http://ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct) |
| **Email** | DPH.covidalertct@ct.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [State of Connecticut Department of Public Health 410 Capital Avenue Hartford, CT,  06103](https://www.google.com/maps/search/State%20of%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health%20410%20Capital%20Avenue%20Hartford,%20CT,%2006103) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

> I'm not sure how to rate this app (see the XKCD comic on tornado warnings). I'm mostly reviewing to point out a SERIOUS flaw in the design of this app. I live on the border w/ NY. NY has it's own identical app. I can not run both apps at the same time. So I have to pick between CT or NY. What is the reason for this and why is this administered by the states at all? Why isn't there a national app?<br> :date: __2020-12-19 03:49:17__

> Im not going to test this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 15:53:24__

> After deep diving the privacy claims of this app, I feel given it's a fully voluntary system that if you're concerned about covid-19 infection/spread, this app is a useful tool to protect yourself/loved ones while also contributing to the greater good by stopping the spread. Unlike other w reviews, I have had no noticable battery issues B-LE feature on my Note 9. Lost 1 star for some UX bugs I'm sure will be resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 01:47:48__

> Impressive. I am impressed at the effort expended by the State of CT to ensure the safety of its residents, creating an app to track and notify exposure to the threat of a virus that kills approximately 1% of the population (not counting the elderly and those co-morbid), and at the same time continue with the virus-turned-political-weapon that is the COVID19/WUHAN virus. I recall an era when individuals whom presented a threat to the health of others were the ones quarantined. Ugh.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:16:10__

> I hope this updates with past exposures/past positive testers too since I just installed it & it's only providing new reports, of which it's currently empty. Also hope the Samsung Secure Folder installation glitch will be fixed soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 20:25:25__

> Bluetooth and location are always on. Significant battery drain. When a covid notification pops up, it does not take you to view that information. Rather you have to download the active app or you just get a spinning wheel.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 02:19:50__

### Description
> COVID Alert NJ App is being made available by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) to complement New Jersey’s comprehensive COVID-19 contact tracing effort. COVID Alert NJ is a free and secure mobile phone app that allows New Jerseyans:
<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 – even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 – especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push “Allow” COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to “Allow” your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also “Allow” your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

> I feel like if more people used this app it could help in lowering the cases in NJ. So the app senses if you come in contact with somebody that has covid. I have not ever been contacted so I'm not really sure if enough ppl are using the app or if I have been really lucky.

Without bluetooth you are still able to access and use all of the other features like covids daily numbers local/global/etc and also you are able to check in with how you are feeling and report symptoms..just another tool in the fight against covid.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:56:28__

> Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 04:34:50__

### Description
> This is the official app of New York State, run by the NYS Department of Health as part of New York State’s comprehensive COVID-19 testing and contact tracing effort. The ultimate goal is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by:
<br>1. Alerting you if a sick person spends 10 mins or more within 6 feet of you, because this puts you at a higher risk of SARS CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. 
<br>2. Encouraging you to contribute to the health and safety of your friends, family and community by alerting others if you test positive, WITHOUT REVEALING YOUR IDENTITY TO ANYONE!
<br>3. Getting you important resources and help if you are exposed or test positive. You can call the COVID Alert NY Hotline or find helpful links to resources on next steps to protect your loved ones.
<br>4. Keep a private log of your own symptoms which can help your health care provider and public health representatives determine next steps.
<br>The app leverages a completely private and secure Bluetooth-based technology that Apple and Google developed. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been vetted extensively by privacy and security experts. We never see your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New York.. Share this app with your friends and family so we can all be safer, together.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The closeness sensing won't work if your phone is in battery saver mode (at least with my phone). If your Bluetooth + location are both on and you're still getting errors, try turning off battery saver/power saving mode.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 17:15:03__

> It's okay but I feel I get no notifications when I'm close to an area that is COVID popular region.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:34:11__

> Just tested positive. Tried to send a notification to all codes I've come into contact with and app requires 6 digit code from a contact tracer. 1. So I'm going to sit here not being able to notify anyone until a contact tracer calls me? A day can mean the difference between life and death. 2. Give us the option to edit our symptoms today. I usually do it in the morning but developed a symptom this afternoon but it was too late, I had already submitted for the day.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 00:34:53__

> I understand privacy but for this app to truly work.... work related we make house calls but ask a series of questions before we enter the home. They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 22:08:36__

> Wish the data on the app was up to date vs 2 days behind.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 17:18:21__

> Could be more useful and informative. Details related to current current zone level and useful misc subjects should be added. User provided information to include self reporting of testing, type of testing, postive/false-positive/negative results, and self/state/organization/employer imposed quarantine. Application update/"whats new" information needs to be detailed, rather than a general out of date blanket statement describing the application.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 02:53:10__

> I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:19:31__

### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children
<br>under the age of 13.,
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |
| **Website**  | [https://www.pa.gov/covid/covid-alert-pa/](https://www.pa.gov/covid/covid-alert-pa/) |
| **Email** | RA-DH-CovidApp@pa.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks.

> The app is simple enough to understand, but the methodology of the Public Health department makes the app useless. I am covid positive, and cannot "sound the alarm" through the app without a special code that was never given to me. So how is the alert system supposed to work if I can't alert anyone??<br> :date: __2020-12-10 06:03:19__

> I like the information but the numbers don't match up to what the state reports on the website or what the news reports. The app is saying that there were over 7,200 new cases yesterday but a news website is reporting over 8,700.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 03:03:47__

> I guess ok have not had any alerts yet thank God<br> :date: __2020-12-05 23:58:01__

> It does not appear to follow me via GPS, i live in lancaster but work all over the Philadelphia area and the app seems to only use the default county selection (unless i missed something). Makes it pretty useless for anynone that travels in PA.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:33:58__

> I like the concept of the app, and we clearly need something like this. My huge complaint is that the developers continually respond with no location services or gps is needed.That is patently false, if I want to receive notifications the gps has to be on ( and the screen that popped up telling me that the gps had to be on in order to get the notifications sems to confirm what everyone else was saying). Remake the app so no one needs gps just for safety and I'm all in<br> :date: __2020-11-27 05:38:12__

> Reporting symptoms is easy. But Covid data does not seem accurate. Or, I am misunderstanding the data since the data columns are unlabelled.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 21:12:48__

> Not sure that this is truly private. If I have to give my phone number to DOH employee to receive Random ID, then this is no longer private because DOH then has my phone number and knows my identity. How is this private or confidential?<br> :date: __2020-11-18 23:14:49__

> Since the last update they took off the daily death count. They only tell you the total death count up to the current date. Because of this the app doesn't exactly tell you the whole situation currently. In begining I actually liked the way app, but since of the many changes that isn't the case anymore. I feel as if they are trying to hide the real truth to the situation & that isn't a good thing at all.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 20:53:01__

> The info on it is useful. But the app itself seems to shut off my Bluetooth on its own. After downloading the app my Bluetooth never stays on. I Uninstalled the app yesterday and my Bluetooth stays on. I use my Bluetooth for other things, so I can't use the app until they fix that.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 20:10:14__

> This peticular app should be integrated into phones to be mandatory. It is only effective if those who test positive for virus VOLUNTARILY input there special number. Too many people are acting like this is taboo. Anyone who tests positive for any type of pandemic disease should not declare this info as private.

> I see quite a few people claiming this app doesn't need location tracking to be on, yet it's asked me twice to turn on location tracking to use exposure notifications, since I installed it 5 minutes ago. So which is it?!? What will this app actually tell me if I have my location turned off, anything??<br> :date: __2020-11-14 08:12:39__

> Tried this app for less than few weeks or so, often question of how it can actually sense if I have been exposed to someone tested positive covid 19 just by bluetooth and location services ? With having app on and running constantly, considerably drains my battery with having both location on and bluetooth on all the time. How reliable is this app when I'm not always connected to internet or have available cellular data? I don't have unlimited cellular data plan, makes hard for app to work<br> :date: __2020-10-31 03:33:27__

### Description
> MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.
<br>Your personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How MD COVID Alert works:
<br>When devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Maryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Maryland Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | MDH.MDCOVIDAlert@maryland.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> I have android 5 samsung note phone and I could install it. Read the info about the app which explains how it works (without IDg person or phone) and that made it clear that location setting doesnt have to be on. Bluetooth was activated by app; assume i need to have it active when outside the house. Haven't been anywhere yet, so can't really evaluate app properly. But happy to have this app and plenty of free and nearby testing where I live. We can use all the help we can get!<br> :date: __2020-11-11 17:15:01__

> Glad MD was able to get this going. A nationwide alert system would of course be preferable, but the US is obviously not ready for that. Trivial to setup, unobtrusive, and the privacy/security framework seems sound.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:15:46__

> Very basic and not helpful, not as good as the PA state app. MD needs to up their game and show they're serious about getting us to use the app. The app directs us to the MD Dept of Health app which is not very user friendly on mobile devices. In comparison the PA app contains statistics by county, helps you determine if you need a test based on your symptoms, and how to report positive results. MD needs to include the same options.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 17:57:58__

> Installation hung, had to reinstall. though feedback is mentioned, no feedback method built into app. to save power would be nice to be able to turn off when at home location where no visitors or exposure is possible. just installed so may be more feedback later, but no method within app.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 15:31:22__

> App is dependent on assumptions. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID19/SARS2 testing done by PCR is questionable. It is traditionally a quantitative test NOT a qualitative one used for ID. Viral culture is the gold standard. App presumably works by your phone's bluetooth communication with COVID + patient's phone. This function may not work properly. I have my doubts. Anyway, most people survive. Infectious disease has been part of the human condition since the beginning of time.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:26:35__

> Doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 14:50:18__

> I've been exposed on two occasions. It never notified me. The covid contact tracers also called 3 days late. It's pointless.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 16:07:34__

> Power hog<br> :date: __2020-12-22 23:21:05__

> Arrogant and ignorant for each state to release their own app, as if people can't travel or even commute daily over state borders. You can only run one of these apps at a time. Even if you switch between apps, the contacts are only registered for people who run the same app.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:37:42__

> Great concept, however, doesn't work if you can't report a positive test! It's requires MD health department to give you a code. Contact tracer had no clue that they we able to give a code and couldn't figure it out. My efforts to help the community were squandered by a poor system.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:43:39__

> I came in contact with someone who tested positive and it didn't alert me about anything<br> :date: __2020-12-15 12:54:56__

> Broken Process. Useless app. My husband tested positive. The process: your health care provider reports your positive result to the MD Depth of Health and THEY text you a code to enter into the app to report your status. It took 4 days to get that code. Even after entering it, I still haven't received an exposure notification and we're together constantly. Verified all settings are correct. It actually has to work & QUICKLY to benefit individual users & public health. Extremely disappointed.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 03:22:41__

> The app will work when you get tested by the DC run corona virus testing sites. If you go to private clinic there is no guarantee you will get a verification code if you test positive for covid. The private clinics are supposed to report results to the city health dept but if they don't do that you won't get a call from a contract tracer or a verification code to change your status in the app if you are positive. Go to DC health run testing sites and use this app, and then it works well.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 22:28:01__

Hopefully more people start using it, as it doesn't seem to be intrusive or even a battery drain at all (at least on my phone) you will need to have Bluetooth turned on in order for this app to work, but it uses something called low energy Bluetooth, which is probably why it doesn't affect battery life. Overall good, simple app.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 15:05:10__

> App installed fine. I disabled notifications in Virginia app first, installed DC app, but when I go back to VA app it says I can only have notifications turned on for one at a time. ...

> In order to get this app to download, I had to uninstall VA's COVIDWISE app and re-install after the DC CAN app was installed (and then re-enable notifications for both apps once they were both installed). I'm sure this has something to do with androids security permission structure - but it was a little confusing (and I wouldn't have known to do it without reading another user's playstore review).<br> :date: __2020-10-20 18:40:04__

> don't know if it works yet, but Install problem. You need to DISABLE COVID notifications prior to install or it will not allow you to download through play store. This could occur if (like me) you have previously installed another state's COVID app and have enabled COVID notifications. Once installed you can re-enable COVID exposure notifications.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 06:51:41__

### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NC Department of Health and Human Services |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/SlowCOVIDNC](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/SlowCOVIDNC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

### Description
> CO Exposure Notifications is the official Exposure Notifications app of Colorado and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service. 
<br>CO Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.
<br>By enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you are within 6 feet of someone for at least 10 minutes, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you’ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you to a possible exposure. 
<br>If you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications](https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications) |
| **Email** | CO_Exposure_Notifications@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Not sure if it works. Haven't received any notifications after nearly three weeks. There is likely not enough people using this app, and the ones who do use it also use masks and social distancing. It's the ones that don't (use masks, social distance or use this app) you gotta watch out for.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 07:25:48__

> It's helpful<br> :date: __2020-12-07 07:54:07__

> I would like the app to have some way to tell me that I have exchanged tokens with someone, maybe giving me a total for a day. No details, just some indication that the app is doing its job.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 08:25:57__

> It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:19:46__

> Interesting stuff<br> :date: __2020-11-03 04:21:26__

> Great concept but kills my battery. I do have an old phone though so that may be the issue.<br> :date: __2020-10-27 15:53:56__

> I had trouble getting the notifications to work like a lot of people had posted, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked the next time. Not sure what causes this. Glad we have some form of contact tracing!<br> :date: __2020-10-26 03:29:29__

> The title makes it sounds like a carbon monoxide detector -why no mention of COVID-19 or "infectious disease"?<br> :date: __2020-10-26 02:43:35__

> This app doesn't have location access. I just checked the permissions after installing it.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 23:43:32__

> I guess a good app but nobody in my area seems to be using it or posting a positive result in Pueblo County or other counties that I travel to for my job delivering parts, go far as Lamar, west to the San Luis Valley and South to Walsenburg, Trinidad and into New Mexico and you're telling me that I have not been near someone with a positive test result????<br> :date: __2020-12-11 20:39:25__

> Haven't been able to get much info<br> :date: __2020-12-06 18:50:05__

> Called county health department to ask about notification & special code issue. RESULTS: 1) testing agency reports positive tests to the State 2) State notifies counties in which the positive people live 3) w/in 24 hrs, counties notify people who tested positive 4)w/in 48 hrs (cases are mounting),Contact Tracers call infected people & ask w/whom they have been in contact. NO REASON for infected people to need code. Call Labor Dept if there's a work issue. RECOMMEND: call people who know things.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:45:59__

> People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:15:54__

> I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 03:31:37__

> I was in the same house with a person who tested positive... 3 days later... Still no notification! Uninstalling!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 18:55:04__

> Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:54:36__

> Positive test here but can't share my result because I don't have a verification code. failed app so far🤷‍♂️ I've searched for about 15min and can only figure it's because my test was conducted out of state. However, I was around people in CO and would like to share it. Will people share if it's not easily available? I would also recommend information about privacy and how your results a reported. People might have a sense of shame or guilt but might share if there's some sense of anonymity.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 01:48:11__

> This app is too difficult to use for such a life threatening issue. It needs to be more intuitive before the public will actually begin using this app. It is should be easy to use by those who are not comfortable with technology, yet I am very comfortable with technology and the app took a while to figure out Please do something to make this better<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:56:58__

> major power consumption issues. had to uninstall it because I couldn't use my phone normally without having to charge in the middle of the day, and I only really text on an average day. also noticed my phone was running very hot constantly when I had the app installed. this is something we definitely need, but please optimize it so it doesn't make my phone unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:11:35__

> Most users won't have the patience or technical know-how to setup or use this app correctly which makes it nearly completely ineffective. The FAQ site did not have any info on where I could find a confirmation code to report a positive test; I found the answer in the freaking app reviews (CDPHE will eventually text you the code). While the idea is novel, the execution actively discourages adoption and use by anyone except tech-savy users.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:41:13__

> I find as others have said not getting notified. I would also like to see the areas in which covid is reported and numbers. This app seems pretty useless. I hope we as coloradoans aren't having to pay for this. It's clearly broken and doesn't work. Going to delete hate wasting space on my phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:47:12__

> No instructions on how to upload a positive test result to the app. Just "Enter verification code" ??? Where does THAT come from? No instructions on how to proceed from this point. How is this app going to help anyone if you can't upload your test results.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 16:31:33__

> I am so angry. I cannot share my covid test results bc I dont know what a covid verification code is. Seriously what the hell is that? I cannot find any info from this app on what that is nor how to find my own. It should be obvious! You should explain what that is! If you can't share a negative result then state that!<br> :date: __2020-12-30 03:55:33__

> I was around 4 people who tested positive. I never did get a notification.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 01:19:51__

> Didn't work at all.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 21:59:24__

> Not only is this app so poorly used by the populous to warn you against infection, it also prevented me from warning others about my positive diagnosis. I get that the government takes off holidays, the disease did not. I did everything right, and tried to warn others through the app, however the government has not given me a code I need to warn anyone else. Another shining example of wasted money. If I have to wait a week or more for a contact tracer to give me a code, what's the point?<br> :date: __2020-12-27 08:20:21__

> The app appears useless. I tested + . When I try to enter the result, it asks for one time verification code. After extensive searching, I was unable to learn how to get the verification code.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 19:53:51__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Occasional glitches, but on the whole, app works well and happy to be helping<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:26:15__

> I had been using the app daily since March, but in late 2020 the reminders stopped working, so I only remember to log in periodically... I have reinstalled a number of times but nothing seems to fix it. Such a shame after all the team's hard work, can't they get any IT companies to fix these glitches??! PS one day later: tried reinstalling one more time and now finally the notifications are working again - yay!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 18:44:27__

> Does what it says on the tin, you can report your health and covid status to researchers. It can be quite buggy, which is annoying. I went 11 days being unable to report as I couldn't log in until they did a bug fix.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 13:58:19__

> Easy and quick to use. Now mostly warns if there is no connection. However if connection is later lost whilst reporting symptoms, this is not reported. \*\* Broken again: Graphs of All, Month, Week don't show any data \*\*<br> :date: __2021-01-02 11:49:29__

> Normally no problems with app easy to use, however over the last two days my wife nor myself have been able to report app only displaying a white screen even after uninstalling and re installing app glad to say all well now.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 11:27:23__

> Good to know I'm contributing but I did lapse for a while. I think my phone was at fault however. Quick and easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 12:22:17__

> Can't log as when opening I just get a white screen.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 17:37:55__

> The next second zip code feature is great. Thank you for addding. However it would be nice if the app then reported the new zip codes county if you have moved from your original. It would also be nice if the app remebered your previous second zip code.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:29:59__

> Excellent initiative but IT side is the weak link...filled in for 6 months then it did not recognise me despite doing all fixes so had to register under different name to continue its just such a loss of 6 months linked data. That said incredible work that is being done<br> :date: __2021-01-01 11:49:48__

> Yep, I've got the white screen issue now as well. Worked fine until lunchtime 31/12/2020. No matter what I do, uninstall, re-install it still loads and then goes full white screen so I can no longer participate. Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 09:49:05__

> Not sure what it's achieving<br> :date: __2020-12-31 09:24:17__

> Should be useful but seems limited and a tad buggy - stats charts don't show (android 10) when click them to go through to week/month etc view. No notifications despite ensuring they are turned on. And no differentiation between the old antibody test & symptom testing - I had an antibody test months ago when I returned to work. It was positive but never had any symptoms so should be able to clarify this. Also really feel there should be a link to the official number of cases for comparison.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 08:38:35__

> Very clear and useful. 30/12/20 app will not display month or weekly data in graph, only the full set to dec data. Latest version 2.2 and tried a force stop<br> :date: __2020-12-30 18:13:29__

> I have updated the app, but still not getting daily reminders<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:59:09__

> Report in daily but sometimes it's not recorded and I am being told that it's a day or more since I reported in<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:35:47__

> Worked ok until 19th December when it just showed a blank screen after loading. Same after updating. Shame but this type of app must be 100% reliable to be useful. Uninstalling Update 30.12.20 Re installed following email update; seems to be working now<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:33:18__

> I am frustrated because I kept being asked to repeat my report. I have an añdroid phone and I followed your advice to reinstall the app ensuring it is the latest version. I am NOT going to do that anymore and to that end I will not be reporting my status for a week to allow you to SORT this. Many, inclùding those involved in deciding how we are all to live our lives. Your study group use our reports to develop models, which may be skewed by additional reporting.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 17:57:57__

> It used to give me daily notifications to fill out the form but this stopped few months ago nothing I do can change this. Not sure if this is just me or others having the same issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:06:28__

> Used it since the start but reminders stopped two months ago so forget to do it<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:29:28__

> Still unable to add the test result even after restarting the app as the email suggested<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:26:12__

> White screen of doom - I get through to the 'report today' screen very very briefly then it disappears and I get a blank white screen. Clearly not an issue just with my phone or my account by the look of other comments. I've reported daily for months and am disappointed not to be able to continue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 18:10:10__

> I have to say I'm really pissed off with this. There was a fault and it stopped working for a while, now I'm getting emails asking me to reinstall but with no link in the email (a no reply email address!). When you think Facebook manages literally billions of accounts, fully indexed and cross referenced, and these clowns can't cope with a simple database.... I'm doing something else instead<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:41:45__

> Have been an enthusiastic user but sadly Tim Spector is misusing his data to make dangerous pronouncements. There are now better more accurate data sources available so the job here has been done...at this point users are just potential customers for Zoe's diet plans.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:22:05__

> The app is broken... Loads to a white screen.. Deleted and reloaded... Sign in then opens to a white blank screen again, unable to fill in any details...<br> :date: __2020-12-29 11:02:43__

> COVID data for my region is out of alignment with PHE and worryingly the app shows a fall of ~500 from last week and PHE showing a rise of 158 (~39%). True the figures shown widely disagree but the trends should be consistent. The app appears to be making the area looking better than national statistics suggest. Is there a way to get the app to show both?<br> :date: __2020-12-28 08:12:31__

> HELP! I've been logging every day but today after the 'splash' screen I just get an empty white screen and I can't do anything. Tried killing the app and restarting, uninstalling and re-installing but still no luck.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 12:11:50__

> Won't let me enter previous Covid test info so can't use app. Obviously bug in it or an issue with my One Plus 6 phone??<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:09:33__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 03:35:11__

> I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:46:54__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #.

I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up.

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As soon as I tap on "deny" the app automatically closes and locks me out of the service. How is this supposed to be helping me? You don't need access to my phone.

### Description
> Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. 
<br>Designed by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. 
<br>In these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>Note that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.
<br>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>This app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
<br>This temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. 
<br>For more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

> This app does not work for my phone even though It is compatible. I tried to set up receiving the alert through my cell phone it said phone number not available. When I chose the email option I did not receive the email. I then went on line to for help and dialed the number given online and it was the hospital main number. I was then directed to 2 other numbers and no one could help me nor did they know what I was talking about. sincerely, Pauline Mejia<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:39:25__

### Description
> PathCheck (formerly COVID Safe Paths) can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available. 
<br>Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>We are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.
<br>The PathCheck program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck Foundation, established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the PathCheck app and associated tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities. 
<br>The goal of PathCheck is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CareMarket Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.sydneycare.ai](https://www.sydneycare.ai) |
| **Email** | support@sydneycare.ai |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CareMarket+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CareMarket+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This would be better if the doctors were instantly available. There will be hours and hours of waiting and reconnecting and retrying and re-launching the app. I did get to meet with a doctor twice. Once they looked at me, and the next time they actually called in a prescription to my local pharmacy for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 17:31:05__

> Impossible to use, this app crashes right when you get to the section that asks you questions. I've tried two different devices with the same result on each. Update, the related issue was fixed so I've updated my rating. This app still needs a better user experience, so 3 stars now.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:39:51__

> Clunky, confusing setup process. There is a lot of configuration of personal settings even after connecting to the main Sydney health app and my Anthem account. Once you have it set, it still makes you go through the symptom checker before you can use its touted features for communicating with medical experts. Even that might be workable, but there are huge gaps in the symptom checker. I can't start with hypertension or high blood pressure as a symptom? Terrible, frustrating design.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:19:48__

> Think I have Covid but private healthcare is a fail. Horrible App (and somehow I pay for this experience). I have anthem blue cross blue shield and their sydney care app to figure out the covid testing I need with symptoms is a fail. Tries to link accounts but won't login and the reset password doesn't work to the email on file or phone. I can login to their other sydney app just fine. This sydney business has been a wreck since they sought to disconnect it from the name of the provider.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:54:25__

> It will not allow me to get any info over to my work. Will not allow me to download my doctor visit information to my phone or fax it to my work or email to my HR department.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:15:41__

> I have to answer the same questions every time I log in. It doesn't pick up where we left off.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 13:32:00__

> Dumb app does not work!! You can not get passed the login!<br> :date: __2020-09-07 02:37:52__

> App crashes more than all Nascar drivers together. Cant even download an attachment referral. Also have to sign in 8 times just to send one message because it crashes then requires login credentials. Fought with this app for 60 min before I told the doctor to just cancel everything we discussed and I was uninstalling this piece of trash crash app.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 18:39:31__

> Dont download. Cant put in code to register<br> :date: __2020-08-29 17:27:15__

> Keeps going back to main menu, no matter if I try to link it and login with my Sydney health info or try making a new account. There is no in-app chat or trouble shooting. Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this"resource" multiple times. I have a doctorate, and my husband literally writes computer code for a living so this is not user error. If he and I can't figure out how to make it work, it just doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 16:03:30__

> This app sucks I can't even log in...I enter a password and it says my password cannot be my username or part of my username or email even though my password is not!<br> :date: __2020-08-01 01:54:54__

> It just wants to chat with me. Where is the covid quiz. Disappointing for being an insurance benefit.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 03:03:02__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Doctor on Demand is as good, if not better than, my primary care provider who wouldn't care for me because I hadn't had my initial patient visit. The doctors I've seen have been caring, timely and very helpful.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 08:22:44__

> My two experiences with the app have both been great. I know people are in front of me and it takes a lot longer to reach medical provider but this is better than going out. They really get to see candid atmosphere and see things happen live.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 06:14:11__

> Wonderful<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:26:35__

> Phenomenal!! Modern day medicine and a way to see a doctor and get your meds.. Dr on Demand app!! I highly recommend it! The doctor I saw was fantastic she was amazing! With throbbing tooth pain (late at night) she didnt make me wait forever and had my antibiotics called in to a 24hr pharmacy in minutes! What else can you ask for?! With tooth pain.. you don't have a tolerance for anything let alone waiting time. Thanks dr On Demand!<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:14:18__

> Love how you can be seen and treated at home without having to go too many places when feeling sick! All the doctors I've seen are great and thorough in diagnosing you and sending prescriptions to your preferred pharmacy fast to get treatment.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 03:41:37__

> Exceptional<br> :date: __2021-01-03 03:14:46__

> Very professional<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:31:59__

> So nice to have as an option.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:25:55__

> Amazing<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:11:38__

> Incredible! Really! Dr+ is a Godsend and has made it much easier to get the medical treatment I need. I live in a rural area with few doctor's which often makes appointments hard to come by witbout being very ill. I look forward to continuing to use this platform. It is so easy to navigate and keeps you updated all the way through your appointment making it easy to keep up with visits that may otherwise be forgotten about. Thank you Dr+! Truly, thank you!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:10:10__

> Very helpful info<br> :date: __2021-01-01 01:21:01__

> My first visit was years ago and it was ok, but I'm not a fan of telemedicine. The 2nd was disconnected before it even got started, so I went back in and set up a same day appointment. Third times a charm. Although I'm still not a fan of telemedicine, it is better than urgent care or emergency room in non-emergency situations.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:27:21__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-24 19:08:19__

> So far so good. I am still waiting for a good general physician.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 17:16:03__

> Beside the low volume we had no other issues.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 12:49:54__

> Dr sarah was awesome. Support is slow to response online, and instead to sort out why pharmacy didn't received prescription, they just asked to wait few hours, which didn't resolve issue. They are responsive and helpful on phone call. Issue was at CVS pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 02:05:35__

> Great doctor but glitchy video.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:16:15__

> Amazing. Fast. Free.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 17:59:29__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> While Doctor on demand certainly is a lot cheaper than going to a psychiatrist or counselor, those services are still over $200 an hour. During a pandemic, when so many may be needing counseling services, many of us are also still locked down and unable to work, so that price is still out of our reach<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:44:28__

> It was easy to use and quick to get my prescription to my pharmacy. Unfortunately it took way to long to get my doctor's note for work. It has been 3 days. If I don't have it soon, I risk losing my job, because I thought it was a legit, easier and cheaper option than urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:03:23__

> Not what I was looking for<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:32:15__

> Used to love this app when it first came out. It was more affordable for people without insurance or insurance that didn't cover it, $45. Now I see they've gone up to $75 and my current insurance doesn't cover any of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:47:36__

> I absolutely love my doctor. What I DON'T like is that this app screws up appointment availability on a regular basis. They were supposed to message my doctor to explain that the app had no available appointments, which is why I couldn't schedule for the following week. My doctor never even received the message. There are also issues with video quality.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:52:37__

> No connection<br> :date: __2021-01-03 07:56:50__

> I had to cancel my appointment due to an emergency 17 hours before the time I had scheduled. I wasn't able to reschedule it because they have a 24 hour rule and thats completely understandable. Except for the fact they'll still charge me $300 for an appointment I couldn't make or reschedule and now I can't afford to see a doctor at all. What a way to ring in 2021.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:27:28__

> Terrible absolutely ridiculous! Received no help at all! I will never use this app again! If I could of not given any stars to post this I would of.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 05:30:26__

> All they want is your CC# when your insurance company covers everything this is a SCAM!!!?<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:29:22__

> Terrible. I made 2 appointments today. The first was ended automatically as soon as it started with no reason. The 2nd I waited for 15 minutes to then get connected with black video screen to then have that end automatically too. Waste of time. Not sure if there are better alternatives, but anything must be better than this. Especially if you value your time.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 02:03:43__

> Multiple cancellations without notice by different doctors<br> :date: __2020-12-22 21:23:27__

> If you choose to have Dr.Kamra Mays as your therapist, be prepared to have your appointment cancelled 3 minutes before your session with no explanation. No phone call. No text. Nothing. Not only is this unprofessional, its inconsiderate. If you do chose to use this app, avoid Dr.Kamra May's.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:33:06__

> Be aware that you run the risk of not getting a diagnosis. You will still pay for advice that isn't helpful to your problem...<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:04:17__

> Have used this app before with zero issues. And then yesterday came and I have an appt. That appointment goes just fine and doctor says she will call me in a script which was the reason for appt - med refill. Usually within less than an hour the full summary is written by doc and posted on app for me and then the script is called in NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED. I have submitted questions for customer service for help and no one answers me. At all. Over 24 hours has passed and radio silence. ......<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:49:48__

> Dr. Phil said that his app covered Medicare specifically Mental Health appointments during the pandemic... it does not cover Medicare! I deleted it immediately it was a lie.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:57:48__

> Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:52:12__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> Great info🚑🤗🦋<br> :date: __2020-07-08 16:35:23__

> Cant edit my birthday<br> :date: __2020-08-07 16:48:00__

> Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 15:57:52__

> Hard to put in my health symptoms. Touchy with even short word descriptions. Like trying to crack a code that you know nothing about.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 15:02:31__

> Love this app. Very useful. Had to take off 2 stars because the database is missing many medications and conditions.<br> :date: __2020-06-22 06:31:47__

> Not what it use to be<br> :date: __2020-06-14 07:40:45__

> This was updated. Since then, I can't save my medications on the check interactions. We use to be able to do that. Save our medications. That helped me a lot. It helped me remember what not to take together. I have about a dozen medications that I take. I was really liking this. The medication you added, was there until you would delete it. Now, that's not a option at all. What's the clear all needed for, if medications don't get saved. Now, I hate it.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 01:45:09__

> The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:54:00__

> Need to deliver still waiting on my prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-03 01:39:54__

> I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:18:03__

> This was a great app especially with the symptoms checker but now that feature doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 15:26:48__

> I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:02:53__

> I have found that searching for certain terms, such as "dementia", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:13:12__

> Notifications have become political. Delete<br> :date: __2020-10-09 02:43:16__

> Not user-friendly<br> :date: __2020-10-03 08:56:22__

> I couldn't find some of the meds I take. I'm not sure if this app is aware of Canadian medicine terms and generic drug names. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 21:12:12__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A ways to go but a great start. The login process could be smoother, takes a bit to get in so log in before you need it. The image is a bit stretched in the app vs your id card. Lastly, I wish they did more education to businesses so they understand this is a legal version of identification.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 05:06:04__

> *update* changed review from 1 to 4 stars. After failed attempts to load, contacted support team and it loaded perfectly. Not convenient that, but yes loaded. Has worked great since. Used ID to get fishing license no prob. Used for other times no prob In state. Not used a lot, but nice when I have.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 15:59:26__

> This app saved my life but now it keep saying retry otp and now I can't use it for my I'd. How I'm supposed to buy my essential things with no I'd!<br> :date: __2020-09-25 20:54:47__

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> Only after 10 attempts (using my new DL that just arrived in the mail earlier that day) was it able to register my driver's liscence in the virtual wallet. Other than taking forever to scan my documents, the app is pretty darn good.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 04:06:34__

> Everything was bool, then my picture didnt show up<br> :date: __2020-07-22 03:08:11__

> Drivers license does not show all the license it cuts off not able to see entire number cannot retake picture of new license that i renewed other parts of the app work great<br> :date: __2020-07-13 16:56:19__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Everything I upload the front side of my ID it kicks me out and makes me login in again??<br> :date: __2020-09-08 00:43:05__

> Frustrating. Trying to help roommate update his state id. Got to taking pics of id but then it would ask to log in after taking pic of back id. Multiple times. Hes mentally disabled and gets so frustrated that he almost punched a hole through a door window... he has little patience and gets so frustrated easily with almost anything.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 16:55:34__

> Need more documents<br> :date: __2020-05-26 17:43:27__

> 5/17/2020 I came back to the app to see if any functional utility was turned on. Instead all it does is open the website for each issue. I thought this app would provide a list of my vehicles and what the registration status is. How about selecting a vehicle to order a copy of title? I uploaded my license as proof of identity, why?<br> :date: __2020-05-18 00:48:27__

> I'm STILL not sure what the actual use of this is. when i added my ID it said it's not a replacement for the physical ID. also it's been easier to just pull out my ID than login again. at least the one time i was gonna use it i just gave up because i didn't have time to go through the verification process every time.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 23:55:02__

> Sweet, I need a registration renewal and everything is closed. So I see on Nextdoor about this app. But I can't use it - why? I have a 2 yr old $150 Lenovo Phab which won't allow this app. So I need to buy a new phone to use - great. Not everyone can afford a new phone every year especially Seniors. The emissions places are closed as are the DL locations so I guess I just drive with an expired tag.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 20:23:52__

> This app is ridiculous. I keep installing it over and over and over and over again and restarting my phone over and over and over and over again and everytime I try to scan my ID the app crashes. This is beyond frustrating I don't see why I can't just physically enter in my information this is so stupid.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 00:50:17__

> Wont download<br> :date: __2020-12-23 06:08:34__

> Freezes the phone and crashes every time it tries to get a face map after log in. I still have yet to actually USE the app, so bye-bye<br> :date: __2020-12-20 15:54:45__

> I just got my temporary paper ID the app will not allow me to scan it so I cant make an account. This is not cool waste of space on my device.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:28:10__

> This app is a good idea which is not ready for Prime Time. The app is hard to get set up. One can create an account, but then one needs the "Authentication" number which is supposedly emailed. I found that less than 10% of the time did I actually get an email. OK, fine, I eventually got one that worked, and got logged on. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU GET LOGGED OFF, YOU YOU NEED ANOTHER "AUTHENTICATION" EMAIL TO GET LOGGED ON AGAIN, AND THEY MOSTLY DON'T ARRIVE. In addition, this app is supposed to be able to be used on the roadside to touchlessly give one's info to a law enforcement officer. If the emails don't reliable arrive to a home with a fast wired connection, think what problems would arise on the side of a remote road somewhere in rural Colorado. And imagine telling a State Trooper "just a minute, I'm waiting for the email." As long as the app requires an unreliable "Authentication" I certainly can't recommend it. Shouldn't authenticating once be enough? ADDENDUM: A comment on this review from the State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT asked me to contact their tech support. I had previously done that - they said: "When you created your account, Ping ID is used to pair your device. I am reaching out to our developers to confirm what email address is connected to your account. As soon as I have more information I will reach back out and let you know!" After 12 days I have heard nothing. I contacted them again, with a copy of this review, and we'll see if they do anything this time. I know things are weird in this country right now, so I'm willing to patiently wait and see what happens. I'd really like them to address the issue of whether one actually has to do the "Authentication" every time one logs into the app, or if that's an error of some sort. Maybe they could comment on that here?<br> :date: __2020-12-14 23:46:26__

> Looks like it would be a great app, if it worked. . . App crashes every time I scan the back of my license. I tried restarting the phone, not having any other apps in use, no luck.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 19:20:12__

> ID scanner is hot garbage, can't create account<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:51:33__

> Try and do the facial recognition blacks out my camera, if you wanted to steal ppls info in Colorado just ask don't make an app that doesnt even work. Disgraceful!!! Your not even trying to improve Coloradan lives at all, just trying to line each other pockets while we continue to suffer. Pathetic!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:40:36__

> Took me literally 16 tries and a waste of 30 minutes of frustration just for it to recognize my face in a brightly light room for my id. Absolutely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:19:49__

> Businesses in Colorado are refused to accept digital ID. What is the point to have a digital ID? Website said "Colorado Digital ID may be accepted as a legal form of personal identification for use in Colorado". Keyword here is "may" instead of "shall". Business don't have to accept it if they are wish not to.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 01:09:50__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | support@americanwell.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pretty straightforward. Make sure to have a good wifi connection. Unfortunately where I live, we don't have great internet.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:30:33__

> Questions after ER Muscle spasms, severe pain, numbness.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:10:21__

> I had sprained my ankle really bad and I didn't think I needed to go to a hospital and risk getting Covid. The doctor was great very informative and answered all my questions. The downside is the app has a section for emailing your doctor and the one I selected did not receive them. That information should of been on the description of the doctor. I also needed a doctors note she said she'd get it but forgot. Contacted support multiple times till after almost 2 days I got my doctors note.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 00:53:59__

> not happy Dr never called me back my whole head was swollen and I needed antibiotics for an abscessed tooth didn't get them<br> :date: __2020-03-05 19:02:19__

> I have been having a great experience with both the app and Amwell services. It has been a god-send for me for many reasons. I am very grateful my insurance has teamed up with Amwell. However, as time went on I discovered the billing dept really sucks! I had appts scheduled and when I logged in I found that I suddenly had to pay for the visit out of my pocket, but my insurance covers it 100%. I was expected to pay for it and be reimbursed by my insurance. Like I have $80 just sitting around.<br> :date: __2019-11-13 14:10:22__

> Need to use it more. It's a good starting point.<br> :date: __2019-10-25 18:44:01__

> Its good but every tine i log in it makes me reenter my cridit card number.<br> :date: __2019-09-20 01:59:16__

> The look of the app is almost exactly the same as LiveHealth Online Mobile. Has WAY more insurance providers... But still can't find anywhere that will accept Pan America Life insurance. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2019-08-15 04:50:44__

> Disappointed off the bat. was sent an email from uhc to click and register to get an amazon gift card for registering. nada. its a good idea for doctors... help people out by making it cheaper and more accessible during the times of day when people actually get sick. so 3 stars.<br> :date: __2019-05-25 22:29:37__

> So frustrating to use. Never works right and I get over charged.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 22:35:46__

> The service is a great idea and fast. But the app will not allow pictures to be uploaded forcing a video visit. Once they get that fixed, it will be great.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 15:18:06__

> Video of my doctor was not good, nor was the audio with the doctor, we resorted to a phone call for the audio portion. I have been using " Doxy me " for other doctor visits and it works much better.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 19:12:11__

> Not the biggest fan, my insurance wasn't found but the company was listed.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 17:23:27__

> Waited with 11 people ahead of me, only to get to the front, wait another half hour, and then be transferred to someone else, only to be pushed back in the queue even more. When I got to the front of that person's queue, after 15 minutes the app forcefully logged me out! I feel terrible and this was 4.5 hours of my time wasted! Not cool! I really need to see someone.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 03:24:08__

> First visit for my son went great. Doctor was friendly and listened and helpful. Second visit was for me. The doctor couldn't even work his camera correctly so all you could see was the top of his head. He then was very condescending. He didn't even know about one of the medications I was taking (it's used off label for my treatment). He kept insisting it's never used for that I must take it for something else. 🙄 You can't go back to file a complaint.<br> :date: __2020-01-24 11:24:41__

> Don't be surprised that the app doesn't work just when you need it. Today is Sunday and just when I need it, it is not working. Not very 24/7.<br> :date: __2020-01-13 06:46:21__

> Like with all these apps. "Go to a doctor or clinic" I understand to be seen in person. Best bet is to not waste your time and spend more money<br> :date: __2019-11-28 00:51:01__

> My voice was gone due to a sinus infection and the physician that I spoke with kept saying speak louder. I had the phone almost in my mouth and she insisted that she could not hear me. My prescription was never called in to the pharmacy. I will never use this app again. This was a waste of money.<br> :date: __2019-10-17 05:41:47__

> It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge?

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Indiana University Health |
| **Website**  | [http://iuhealth.org/videovisitsapp/](http://iuhealth.org/videovisitsapp/) |
| **Email** | webmaster@iuhealth.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I had problems with this app on first three uses. IU Health tech support was not helpful when the app failed to connect to doctor. Tech said the app should "just work" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone. Seems like something tech support should have thought to suggest.<br> :date: __2020-02-11 20:07:56__

> I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:06:13__

### Description
> Take 30 seconds every day to fight COVID-19. Your daily health check-ins help doctors and scientists anticipate the next outbreak and get ahead of the coronavirus. The first time you download the app and share how you feel, we’ll donate a meal to people in need through Feeding America.
<br>The How We Feel app only asks you to self-report age, gender, postal code and any health symptoms you’re experiencing. It does not ask you to sign in with your name, phone number or email address. The data is securely shared with select scientists, doctors and public health professionals who are actively working to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>The How We Feel app was built by an independent, nonprofit organization called The How We Feel Project. Our organization was founded by a volunteer team of scientists, public health researchers and technologists. Our mission is to make the world healthier by connecting citizens with the global health and research community. The organization was created in March, 2020 to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>We are proud to be working with scientists, doctors and public health professionals from leading institutions including McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
<br>We are collaborating with Dr. Gary King from Harvard University’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science’s Privacy Insights Project. Dr. King specializes in developing technologies to make data available to researchers while protecting participants’ individual identities.
<br>Our technology team includes Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest and a volunteer group of current and former Pinterest employees.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | The How We Feel Project, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.howwefeel.org](https://www.howwefeel.org) |
| **Email** | info@howwefeel.org |
| **Physical address**  | [949 Bridge Rd San Leandro, CA 94577](https://www.google.com/maps/search/949%20Bridge%20Rd%20San%20Leandro,%20CA%2094577) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is the app still useful???? Since a week ago, I don't receive the information of how many people are not feeling well, and the number that are good is really low!! So I became to doubt about the information is true. Also, if this app is really useful for medical purposes you're missing the people with asthma and high blood pressure. Hope to improve the app, or is it the time to delete it?? Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 15:26:38__

> I have had to delete and reinstall the app twice now. Each time I lost all the history.

The App USED to be easy, simple & great but it NO LONGER WORKS! 10/05/20; The "update" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message.

### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>Monthly membership (when you’re not using insurance). $45 for the first visit, then after you will have access to 24/7 virtual doctor visits for just $10 per month.
<br>Pay-per-visit (when you’re using insurance). Costs vary based on insurance copay and deductible. Many plans cover 100%!
<br>Unlike other on-demand providers, HealthTap connects you with a doctor via text or video in less than one minute--not hours or even the next day. We also don’t require you to answer a bunch of questions in advance. You can see a doctor immediately.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>Note that certain medications including controlled substances must be prescribed by a specialist or with an in-person visit, and cannot be ordered by HealthTap doctors or any other on-demand provider.
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>1. ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>2. SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>3. ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.
<br>What people are saying:
<br>PC Magazine - "The next time you have a medical question… try asking the doctors on HealthTap."

<br>HealthTap does not guarantee patients will receive a prescription, does not prescribe DEA controlled substances and may not prescribe non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION.

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable.

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gundersen Health System |
| **Website**  | [http://www.gundersenhealth.org/](http://www.gundersenhealth.org/) |
| **Email** | gldevelopmentservices@gmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Incredibly convenient. It just saved me an hour drive and untold time sitting in urgent care just to have a care provider take a peek at me. I'm a believer after just one e-visit. If it's something that a high resolution photo and a brief description of symptoms could handle this is the ticket. Doctor was very through and set appropriate expectations. Also you get to pick from a list of available doctors and you are able to review their basic credentials on there biography page. Mind blown...<br> :date: __2020-01-21 23:46:25__

> As expected, no problems. Very convenient to see the Dr without having to go into the office. I don't see how to schedule appointments, though; that would be an excellent feature to add.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 22:17:30__

> When in call the sound plays on earpiece not on speaker. The menu option for speaker have no effect and its very difficult to hear such a low voice while having video conference. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 06:53:34__

> Crappy App<br> :date: __2020-09-28 19:08:53__

> It isn't very consistent. Constantly goes in and out. Very irritating when you are trying to talk and listen to your child's doctor and its all messed up.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 20:18:13__

> Functional but not nearly as good of video image and sound connection as a simple Zoom, Google Plus, or WhatsApp. Better than nothing. We were required to use this by our healthcare provider, and it really compromise the ability to communicate during a very important visit.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 16:24:34__

> They used to be good but now they are absolutely a waste of time, all they do now is tell you to visit their office to have the child seen. Hello!! We don't feel safe taking our kids into an urgent care right now. What's the point of this app if you no longer do anything.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 00:36:36__

> Lagging. Voice going in and out. Not able to hear what the other person saying. Screen freezing.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:07:11__

> After waiting almost 45 minutes, the app kicked me out of the waiting, and I had to request a new visit because the Doctor I chose was unavailable. I waited almost two hours, when there were only 2 patients ahead of me. I ended up cancelling the visit because I got tired of waiting online. Not worth it!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 04:13:51__

> Worst Experience Ever! Only once the app has worked for us, rest multiple times it just fails. It says "connecting doctors video" but than fails and says your appointment is canceled. One day we were on hold for 4.5 hours, first it failed call the customer service they reset the appointment, than we waited and the doctor transferred to another doctor and post that failed again. Our friends us CHOP and have never faced such issues.Not sure if its the app or Nemours practices. Will not recommend<br> :date: __2020-07-25 16:52:37__

> Pediatric? Only adult options were listed<br> :date: __2020-07-19 01:15:40__

> Very frusterating. Stayed on the phone for hour just to have the Dr hang up on me due to no connection and i would have full barns on WIFI sitting right next to the box. For days i have been trying to get this to work. And everytime i call the office they just direct me back to this app. On the me help u and it never works. Cant even get my kid seen. Very pissed off mom<br> :date: __2020-07-17 22:37:56__

> The Clermont location is terrible. The staff is incompetent and rude. They do not care about the babies and only want to push products on you without listening to your concerns or needs. Do not go to Nemours in Clermont FL!!! You will be very unhappy!!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 22:39:04__

> My toddler fell outside and cut open his eyebrow. I did not want to go to the urgent care or ER and expose us to c- virus, so I tried the care connect app for urgent care. We were 11th in line waiting. After over an hour and a half of waiting we were still 3rd in line so I left the app running and pulled up my camera to get a new photo of the injury. I switched back over to the app, to see the doctor had declined seeing us. It would've been nice if the app had some type of way to alert you.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 00:06:50__

> Would give zero stars if I could. It says online that they treat ear infections, so I booked an appointment. She has an ear pain and a fever. They said she doesnt have an ear infection and even if she did they wouldn't treat her. That means I just wasted $60. Don't waste your time. Go to a real doctor. I know my doctor would've treated her infection because she's my 4th child and I've been through this many times. I'm so upset! This is what I get for trying to take shortcuts!<br> :date: __2020-03-26 23:36:46__

> Absolutely useless waited 1hr for the doctor to log off and the system to kick me out and make me start all over.........I could wait till morning and see my primary faster<br> :date: __2020-03-25 03:04:17__

> This app doesn't work for me because when I was with waiting for the doctor the app stop<br> :date: __2019-11-20 03:32:03__

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider! PLUS I don't get money back even though the N C Doc's turn me away within 60 sec of logging on. There is no one monitoring this so no way to complain or request a refund. This is a Waste Of Time and Money!<br> :date: __2019-11-11 02:33:43__

> Worst app that I have ever used. It can't connect properly to my insurance on every visit and their personnel don't seem to actually know how to fix the situation each time that I have tried to use it. Also, the damn thing will suddenly kick you off of the appointment while you're waiting once you give up on getting a free appointment and pay for it. Don't use this unless they fix their massive problems. This thing is a mess!<br> :date: __2020-12-06 17:44:15__

> Always technical issues. I have the newer smart phone and I pay for the internet. It always kicks me out.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:50:39__

> Couldn't even connect<br> :date: __2020-07-01 23:41:53__

> It doesn't open 😠 I've tried and tried and nothing!!<br> :date: __2020-04-12 03:17:30__

> Why, oh why...when I do my initial login, after the app sends me an email verification code, does the app kick me back to the initial login screen when I switch my phone screen to said email to obtain said verification code, thereby invalidating the aforementioned verification code? When I put my credentials back in, I am sent a new verification code. Rinse, lather...repeat... Will I ever be able to login without requiring a secondary device just to check my email???<br> :date: __2020-04-04 03:09:35__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Cleveland Clinic |
| **Website**  | [http://www.clevelandclinic.org](http://www.clevelandclinic.org) |
| **Email** | clevelandclinicmobile@gmail.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Cleveland+Clinic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Cleveland+Clinic) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> life saver<br> :date: __2020-10-26 10:37:41__

> I had my first visit on May 10 2020. The doctor was fabulous. I just needed an asthma inhaler refill. Walgreens pharmacy said the script didn't list generic as acceptable. Put shortly, it was resolved. However, the inhalers were recalled a few months later. I came back to Express Care to explain I needed a new script. Others need returned. Again, doc was great. What upsets me is getting charged $55. I paid for 2 visits & 4 inhalers unnecessarily. Disappointed<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:10:48__

> Had to re enter things a couple times. I hear they're working on it.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 00:49:25__

> Positive once the bugs were worked out.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 16:22:28__

> The doctor was good. The issue I have is if you take too long inputting information after you choose a provider, it will kick you off and say that the provider is no longer available and you have to start over again.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 21:44:07__

> Connection was weak. Lots of questions to answer.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 02:55:23__

> Very cumbersome. It should connect automatically with my chart so I don't have to answer 1000 questions already on file.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 01:27:51__

> Okay sometimes, but has glitches. Use of third parties in a health care app is not acceptable.<br> :date: __2020-07-25 20:55:49__

> unable to transfer my chart to newer phone. can not access my chart from previous phone.<br> :date: __2019-03-22 13:21:20__

> I had connection issues a couple minutes after the appointment started. I disconnected and tried to reconnect, but the app wouldn't let me do that. I ended up just doing the appointment over a phone call, much simpler and more reliable that way.  It's also annoying that it makes you fill out payment info and other forms right when you're supposed to have your appointment, instead of letting you do that in advance.<br> :date: __2017-09-02 05:19:50__

> Can't really rate them high when I get get the ap to work and there is ZERO technical support. I've tried to sign up twice and filled in all my info and it just says "checking insurance info" and spins. Then after several minutes it asks me to log in and when I do it says "my password or username is wrong". Ive done it twice. It didn't work. Too cheap to have a support phone number so screw them.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 22:06:10__

> Slow<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:25:56__

> I tried 3 times to use this, every time when it got to the video it just stopped loading. Total wate of time when I was really sick and needed to see a Dr. That was after it froze numerous times on the beginning screen. I had to reinstall twice and log back in, even call the customer service to reset my password moments after I'd been logged in and it kicked me out.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:45:30__

> Tried to connect 4 times. The app told me I was connected but was waiting for the provider. My appt was cancelled 4 times by the provider. Every time I tried remaking the appointment I had to wait in line, so clearly the problem wasn't with the provider's connection. This app was a giant waste of 1.5 hours of my day.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 21:04:51__

> I can't even open the app anymore. It just crashes outright.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 20:57:21__

> It didn't work the first 3 times because of the video connection. Then made connection video started to work and went out, audio only...only choice was to reconnect and lose my place in line again. Poor app wasted a lot of my valuable time.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 23:16:46__

> MY INFORMATION IS CORRECT!! YET I STILL CAN'T LOG IN!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 04:21:33__

> Terrible. Can't even get set up. Have tried numerous times, just keeps looking for my insurance info...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 21:16:01__

> Terrible! Just awful. You have to reenter everything if you go off the app! The number for help doesn't work! The damn thing doesn't lists all insurance! It's just awful! Worst thing to happen to Cleveland Clinic since parking down town!<br> :date: __2020-08-02 18:46:04__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Genesis Health System |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | noreply@genesishealth.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Genesis+Health+System](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Genesis+Health+System) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Prompt service<br> :date: __2021-01-03 05:39:47__

> Knowledgeable clinician was available quickly and gave thorough information. There was a lag in video/audio which is why I only gave 4 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 22:08:17__

> Easy to use and extremely helpful<br> :date: __2021-01-02 18:10:12__

> Dr. Was very friendly he was understanding and helpful.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:12:07__

> Audio was pretty clear except when we both started talking. Video was slightly grainy the entire conversation. Help from Dr. Susan Diamond was 5/5<br> :date: __2020-12-17 13:30:12__

> Overall, this is an amazing app and an incredible blessing during a pandemic. Dealing with continued therapy appointments has proved to be a tad difficult. Obviously one would like to keep the same provider but you are unable to schedule another appointment until the next day and unless the provider is currently seeing patients, they don't show up in the list to select. Other than this small issue, this app is worth dealing with!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:31:36__

> This has been super helpful for the pandemic. Do have some issues for the 2 times I used it connecting to the video call. Seems to look like it freezes and the doc is either not joining or something is wrong and no indication of what it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 16:26:53__

> A little glitchy at first. Was unable to add my medication and allergy history. The problem resolved itself within a few days. Other than that, a fantastic application. Easy to use, quality video and audio, and a plethora of healthcare providers at your fingertips<br> :date: __2020-12-03 18:14:50__

> Super buggy. Lacks adequate loading signifiers. Lacks profile signifiers when 2 people share the same name. Refreshes spontaneously when trying to create profile. But still a good service. Was able to get my medicine way faster than if I scheduled a live appointment.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 04:32:18__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> The app works, but is frustrating. It continually says I have a message waiting but there is no message to read. I made an appointment, PAID, and then doctor never showed. So now what? I paid and got no service.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:22:16__

> Great experience, would definitely use again. It was convenient and very easy to use. Update: Used again and was extremely disappointed. The doctor never looked and my pictures that I had sent. Also I wanted a video call, instead the doctor called me on the phone, he was driving and like I said he never looked at my pictures because he asked me to describe my rash. Without looking at my pictures he went ahead and diagnosed me even after I told him I already had the prescription he prescribed it<br> :date: __2020-12-01 17:20:58__

> It keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:47:38__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> Auto created account through cigna, username looks like a name and UUID, but login of app doesn't allow more than 30 chars and doesn't accept email (site does). Unable to login via app, so kinda useless there.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 21:11:42__

> I have tried to use this app to separate times to speak with a doctor using a video call and the first time it would not take my credit card information and I never could get that to complete and now this second time I could never get past the screen asking for my blood pressure my heart rate my blood glucose levels and that sort of thing I can get to that point and it would never go any further no matter what I did so I just closed the app logged into the website through Google and everything w<br> :date: __2020-07-23 17:07:26__

> The app is ok. There were always some issues with the the video chat and scheduling. The dr I spoke to basically had no idea what I was talking about. He just got paid for telling me to go to urgent care. Which I finally got a hold of my PCP and she figured it out.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Bronson Healthcare Group |
| **Website**  | [http://Bronsonhealth.com](http://Bronsonhealth.com) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Looking for a faster, easier way to see a doctor? With video visits, you can see a provider anytime from your smartphone, tablet or computer. It is easy to use, private, and secure.

<br>What are the benefits of video visits?
<br>Patients enjoy the hassle-free experience of online visits, including:
<br>· Affordable, easy, and convenient
<br>· Your choice of U.S. board-certified doctors
<br>· No appointment, no waiting
<br>· 24/7/365 mobile or web access

<br>· Sore throat
<br>· Fever
<br>· Abdominal pain

<br>· Pink eye
<br>· Ear infection  
<br>· Migraines
<br> 
<br>Who are the doctors?

<br>· Have an average of 15 years of experience in primary and urgent care
<br>· Are U.S. board certified, licensed and credentialed

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | University of Missouri |
| **Website**  | [https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits](https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits) |
| **Email** | mudoitappsdevsupport@missouri.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Division of IT 615 Locust St, Columbia, MO 65211](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Division%20of%20IT%20615%20Locust%20St,%20Columbia,%20MO%2065211) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | [http://www.livehealthonline.com](http://www.livehealthonline.com) |
| **Email** | help@livehealthonline.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later.

> App is very frustrating. Filled out my information and accidentally put in my credit card instead of my HSA card. I immediately cancelled and later, I received an email from my CC company stating my credit card was charged. I had to start over entering all my my information along with my son's ailments. I selected to see the first Dr. available. The app said someone would be with me soon. No estimate on how much time so I am sitting staring at my phone thinking soon would be 5 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 04:23:36__

> Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 22:45:22__

> The visit went well however i need a prior auth for an eye medication for my eyes it has been since September 2nd and it is now sept 5th and i have absolutely nothing for my eye so it went from " allergy pink eye" to full blown pink eye in my right eye i cannot contact the doctor nor can i send her a message i paid 58 dollars to see this doctor and now i have to waste time going to an urgent care just a suggestion check insurance to make sure a prior auth is not needed b 4 prescribing a med.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 22:30:20__

> Trying to see a doctor all day but the system won't verify my insurance. It wants me to pay full price then wait for reimbursement. Customer service was no help.

> The video portion kept freezing and then halfway through my session it cut the audio down so low that I could barely hear the person on the other end. I'm really disappointed that I had to end my session all because your application could not keep the audio up.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 22:41:13__

> App worked well and I was able to get a phone call with a doctor in a few minutes. HOWEVER the phone call only lasted 3 minutes and the doctor was very rude. I wasn't even given the opportunity to share all my symptoms before he told me I should just go to urgent care. I was prescribed generic medicine for the flu. So that's good I guess but I wish I could have gotten a doctor that cared. Save your money and find a different virtual website or just go to urgent care. I'm dissapointed :(<br> :date: __2020-05-15 00:36:45__

> I lose the provider more often with this app no matter the network I connect to. I have used the app and the site. It makes me not want to use it.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 17:22:45__

> The app crashed on me while I was in line for an hour, twice! On a separate occasion, I finally got through to a doctor and he was rude, short and unhelpful. I was telling him about my symptoms and he was telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't think I will use this service again.<br> :date: __2020-04-12 20:30:33__

### Description
> 98point6 provides on-demand diagnosis, treatment and consultation from board-certified physicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy—all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get the right care at the right time. No appointments, no travel. We’re available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. 
<br>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
<br>There are two ways to get 98point6: via a Personal Plan or a Sponsored Plan.
<br>Personal Plans subscriptions come at an introductory rate of $30 for the first 3 months, with unlimited access to on-demand care for just $1 per visit. When that initial period ends, you have the option to enroll in an annual plan for only $120 per year + $1 per visit. (Please note, only one patient per account. You must be 18+ to create an account and seek care; 19+ in Nebraska.)
<br>Some employers, health plans and retailers provide access to 98point6 at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your plan sponsor.
<br>WHAT DOES MY PERSONAL PLAN SUBSCRIPTION COVER?
<br>Your 98point6 Personal Plan provides you access to our board-certified physicians who offer consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Insurance is not required for your visits. Patients are responsible for any outside-of-app costs, including prescriptions, labs and visits to an in-person physician, if referred. 
<br>WHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS?
<br>Our virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected, board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible and affordable. They are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (98point6 supports photo, video and audio as needed.)
<br>WHAT CAN YOU TREAT? 
<br>Our board-certified physicians are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when it matters, guide you towards the most appropriate next steps. If your issue does require in-person care, you can be sure you’re on the right path to feeling better after consulting with a 98point6 physician. 
<br> 
<br>Common conditions we treat include:
<br>• Cold, cough and flu
<br>• Urinary tract infections (UTI)
<br>• Acid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues
<br>• Yeast infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
<br>• Muscle sprains and strains
<br>• Seasonal allergies, asthma and respiratory issues
<br>• Skin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn
<br>• Women’s health, such as birth control 
<br>• Nausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis 
<br>• General health questions
<br>• ...and more
<br> 
<br>WHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? 
<br>Our doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications. However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what’s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. 
<br> 
<br>Note: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | 98point6 Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.98point6.com](https://www.98point6.com) |
| **Email** | support@98point6.com |
| **Physical address**  | [701 5th Ave, Ste 2300 Seattle, WA 98104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/701%205th%20Ave,%20Ste%202300%20Seattle,%20WA%2098104) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=98point6+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=98point6+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app almost seems to good to be true. Been using it a year now. Visit a doctor anytime, from anywhere for a dollar a visit (plus $120 annual fee) App works great and the doctors really listen. I love being able to talk to a doctor over chat. I don't have to worry about setting up a webcam, or family members overhearing the visit. Not a full replacement for an in person doctor, but for things that can be diagnosed remotely it's more convenient, and less stressful than going in person.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 19:16:00__

> Quick and easy all without leaving my couch!<br> :date: __2020-10-03 15:33:12__

> Provides a pretty quick and detailed appointment. Questions vet you so a doctor is more prepared, and they can schedule lab work and tests from within the app. Of course, since this is digital, they are extra cautious of all symptoms, but I've used this three times with good results.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:30:09__

> Takes a while to actually communicate with a real doctor, and then of course its still just texting, no voice, which I don't like. But I appreciated getting a doctor's opinion on a covid matter.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 00:55:56__

> Decided to give app a shot. Got connected to a doctor. She did not listen, listed my symptoms completely wrong, and wrong diagnosis. Since this time, I have spoken with management, not customer service. They listened to the issues and will hopefully correct them. It is a fairly new app, with time there may be improvement.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 23:39:39__

> Very thorough<br> :date: __2020-08-10 14:03:47__

> Useless if you need a dr for children. At this time its only for adults. Which they didnt tell me until AFTER i paid for a subscription and started speaking with a dr<br> :date: __2020-04-19 22:11:02__

> Completely useless. Three attempts, three disconnected sessions, no resolution of any kind, an hour of wasted time. Edit... increasing to three stars due to customer service response phone call. App still needs work.<br> :date: __2020-04-15 18:57:13__

> Chat based telehealth has a lot of potential, and the app worked fine, but the doctor barely said anything. He didn't tell me his diagnosis, just said "I think we can treat this with strong topical antibiotics", and confirmed my pharmacy. I had to ask him what he was prescribing. He responded with 1 word (the medicine name), and them ended the chat - didn't tell me how to use it or how long it would take to heal or ask if I had any other questions, etc. Left me with little confidence.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 20:56:16__

> Interface is not user friendly. But, with persistence you can manage it. I made a mistake filling out the create account form, my birthday was wrong. However, the form pointed me to my name, which it allowed me two tries and then I had to uninstall to get more attempts to get the information correct. I could understand a password. I have yet to use it to see a doctor. I hope that experience is better.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:41:33__

> Great concept but a real cra\*\*y app. I have insurance. The only questions asked have nothing to do with anything other than basic personal info. You got next and theb told your not covered. $120? I don't think so. Some of us are on social security<br> :date: __2020-08-14 14:02:12__

> Didn't like it<br> :date: __2020-08-12 20:17:58__

> Some doctors know what they are doing and actually get to the point. Others happen to treat you like a box to be checked off regardless of whether or not you receive correct treatment. But most commonly, doctors treat you like you're faking to be sick just to talk to nab a prescription. In my case, I have 2 ear infections, a sinus infection, and acute tonsilitis. I'm motion sick, nauseous, my head is heavy, I have varying fevers, etc and they won't give me antibiotics. A local clinic covered me.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 03:36:11__

> The app is great concept, meaning you dont have to get up to see a doctor as you can speak to a doctor right on your phone. The reason why I purchase the app was for that reason. My Bartholin Gland was very swollen and I was in severe pain, too painful to get up. I spoke to a doctor who told me to go to the ER. I didn't want to go to the ER considering the circumstance that at this time there is a COVID19 epidemic and I didn't want to be selfish to occupy a room when someone else needs. No meds<br> :date: __2020-07-05 21:15:22__

> Computer questions redundant, did not correctly respond. Example: I said no cough, it kept asking about my cough. Today I attempted follow-up, but did not get notification when Dr. available. Dr. ended chat one minute before I checked again.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 19:22:01__

> Same rigid and dogma, same low efficiency with other doctors, but good attitude. This is why American average lives are less than Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 00:21:52__

> No way to password protect. Anyone can view medical information which is a hippa violation. Please update app with fingerprint and pin options to protect privacy. Then I will raise back to 5 stars as I do like the app.<br> :date: __2019-03-16 02:01:47__

> I have a health coverage from my ex employer the treasure dept<br> :date: __2018-10-06 22:07:38__

> The first time i used this app was great...after that it was useless.. The drs didnt want to do anything to help me and suggested i go to a dr... I have no insurance and my normal dr is a low income clinic that takes months to get an appt at... And i cant afford an er visit each time i need a medication refilled...

> Useless. I have used the app three times. Each time the result was a big fat nothing. Each time i then went to Urgent care , around $140-$150, and was told I have a sinus infection and was subscribed an anti-biotic.

### Description
> iBlueButton has been designed by physicians to allow you to have in your hands at all times your detailed medical history, enriched with personalized medical care guidance and important health safety warnings including risk factors for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). iBlueButton helps better manage your healthcare, prevent medical errors, and avoid costly unnecessary care all from the privacy and security of your device. Data is stored directly on your device, it is never shared or sold for any purpose. 
<br>iBlueButton won multiple awards over the years including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button program. iBlueButton is the first Medicare approved native mobile Blue Button application, and you can find the app listed on the Medicare.gov website (go to Manage Your Health). As a partner of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) since 2011, iBlueButton is also approved by the VA to allow Veterans to download their VA health record and assemble it into an interactive Summary Record, including graphic display of lab results & vital signs.
<br>iBlueButton can also retrieve TRICARE Blue Button records, allowing Military and their families to assemble all of their records into an enriched Summary Record.
<br>For Medicare beneficiaries & their caregivers, iBlueButton lets them login into their MyMedicare.gov account to retrieve their medical claim history which is then automatically translated into an organized medical history.
<br>Benefits of iBlueButton:
<br>- BE PREPARED WITH YOUR CRITICAL INFORMATION ALWAYS WITH YOU
<br>At the physician’s office or in the emergency room, be prepared with all the information you need securely organized and stored by iBlueButton on your smartphone or tablet. iBlueButton pulls and organizes your health records into easy to view sections. Your medical history is available for you at all times to review, research, understand medical terminology, annotate, and select the specific information you want to share.
<br>- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS
<br>iBlueButton automatically generates important safety warnings about your medications to help you prevent adverse drug effects, alerting you about highly addictive opioids and of potentially dangerous drug-drug interactions, or medications which should be avoided if you are over the age of 65. iBlueButton also provides professionally recommended medical care guidelines for common chronic conditions and now generates warnings and prevention alerts for individuals at risk for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with access to CDC prevention guidance. 
<br>- LIFE AND COST SAVING
<br>On average, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians a year, with most physicians not having the full medical history of their patients, which can cause medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place in both VA and private-sector facilities. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.
<br>- SECURE AND PRIVATE, UNDER YOUR CONTROL
<br>Unlike most personal health applications, your information is only stored securely on your device, under your control, not in the cloud. Your data remains yours, with no risk of tampering or hacking and is never shared or sold.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Humetrix, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ibluebutton.com/](http://www.ibluebutton.com/) |
| **Email** | ibb.support@humetrix.com |
| **Physical address**  | [1310 Camino Del Mar, Suite C Del Mar, CA 92014](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1310%20Camino%20Del%20Mar,%20Suite%20C%20Del%20Mar,%20CA%2092014) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 20:03:58__

> Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:31:01__

> My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 00:29:47__

> Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at "higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:33:49__

> I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:29:37__

> Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:14:19__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2019-10-15 01:10:34__

> Great app to organize your medical information found on the Medicare website in Manage your Health.<br> :date: __2019-10-04 21:19:10__

> After using iBlueButton for a couple of months I noticed it was not updating my information.  The Humetrix support team was friendly, responsive, and pro-active in addressing the issues I had with the app.  As I reported issues they fixed them promptly and genuinely seemed to appreciate my input.  IBlueButton is a useful app with the best customer support I've seen in years.<br> :date: __2019-09-28 00:31:00__

> Using this app I found not one but two pretty huge errors in the information a doctor provided to Medicare, including a medication condition I never had. Recommend.<br> :date: __2019-09-24 18:09:46__

> A QUICK and EASY Document review system for multiplatform Care Providers. My only link is : " My Health e Vet " and it allows Documented & Statistical Data Review without need to allow entry to my actual secure site. A very pleasingly designed Medical Portal Software Device.<br> :date: __2015-12-31 06:51:01__

> Concept is awesome. Needs work<br> :date: __2015-02-17 17:13:42__

> Tried it since it was updated just yesterday (wanting to stay away from old junk). It won't retain the portal information, at least for VA.  I'd put it on and save but it would erase it and all again.  I used the same info to log on to actual site with no problems.  Maybe VA has changed their portal access or something.  I am a MHV coordinator so I'd love for this to work.  Update...working perfect now!<br> :date: __2014-07-22 20:47:53__

> Still not sure but the concept is a good idea. I will try it first<br> :date: __2018-07-18 14:23:21__

> Not impressed, and for those of you that think that it's an official VA app...IT'S NOT. For security reasons, they still haven't come out with one. Until they do, this is all we have.<br> :date: __2017-10-25 11:39:17__

> The VA app is still in beta. (I know, because I'm in the beta.) Currently only VA employees can access the beta. All I can say is, it's still clunky, like most other apps I've looked at.<br> :date: __2016-11-21 20:23:02__

> Won't access tricareonline.  Unable to contact support as they filter all of those emails.<br> :date: __2016-05-13 00:32:29__

> Supposed to link to my VA page or from my VA page to the app bit doesn't. Have to manually get files/feeds but deletes previous downloaded items.<br> :date: __2015-06-18 05:46:14__

> When entering the password to protect info in the app it does a force close crash on my samsung galaxy exhibit running android  4.1.  After doing some program diagnostics the crash was the result of a  conflict with my swiping keyboard app called swype keyboard. The keyboard app causes the force close crash.<br> :date: __2015-01-19 06:34:09__

> This app seems to work fine as far as downloading my VA medical records. However, it doesn't save any info; neither reports I've just downloaded nor my personal info I just input. If I try to add my personal info from my card, the app crashes consistently.<br> :date: __2014-11-17 16:53:43__

> Sounds like it would be a good app but not able to get past logg in page. Tried uninstall and reinstall but still nothing. Ugh.<br> :date: __2018-08-21 11:55:40__

> I have downloaded and installed this app 5 times and not once have I gotten past the initial password screen. This needs to be diagnosed and  fixed. Other wise it is a pointless time investment. I am a frequent and happy user of the my healthevet application on the web. Having your health records available when you see your doctor (while maybe not essential, it is terribly convenient). we<br> :date: __2017-06-24 18:50:34__

> Great Big Fizzle on VA performance.<br> :date: __2016-04-09 02:02:09__

> Worked fine before now after I paid to get unlimited downloads it just keeps me at the loading screen.<br> :date: __2015-04-12 13:55:58__

> I've uninstall and reinstalled 2x. Unable to email record to anyone. Please fix or tell me how to fix it.<br> :date: __2014-06-29 07:28:24__

> It's a bit of work to set up. If you have an account with the VA or SSA, once you enter & verify who you are, the info should just populate itself; not hand enter everything. There's a memo pad app for that.<br> :date: __2014-03-02 06:34:16__

> I applaud the VA for launching the entire Blue Button Program.   The App is rather inmature and Will take a lot of sweat equity to bring it up to professional standards.   During my first use the App crashed entirely too much.<br> :date: __2013-06-15 05:23:08__

> Terrible app! The UI is cluttered and isn't intuitive. I was hoping to use iBlueButton to link my VA medical records, but it's not any better than the VA's My HealtheVet website. Don't waste your time with this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 19:28:44__

> App won't even open anymore. Just says some error code and that there is a problem with the server. What is the deal!<br> :date: __2020-01-08 07:37:04__

### Description
> Now, board-certified health care providers can care for you or your child wherever you are, whenever you need them, from the convenience of your own mobile device or computer. From coughs and sore throats, to minor skin irritations and joint pain – we have you covered. An easier way to access both adult and pediatric care teams for urgent clinical care needs and common concerns – on your schedule, and in about 10 minutes!
<br>Your virtual visit may even be less expensive than your other care options, compared to urgent care clinics and emergency rooms.
<br>Simply download the app and register, and then select a provider and ‘click.’
<br>Once you select a provider, the online communication begins shortly thereafter! Telehealth providers accessed via the Penn State Health OnDemand app will diagnose, may suggest follow-up care, and can prescribe medication.
<br>Healthcare that meets you where you are and at your convenience; helping you feel better and return to your life sooner.
<br>Penn State Health OnDemand can be used for various common symptoms and concerns:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cough

<br>• Joint pain or strains
<br>• Lower back pain
<br>• Minor rashes and skin concerns
<br>• Painful urination
<br>• Sore throat
<br>• Stuffy and runny nose
<br>

<br>• Coughing/vomiting blood

### Description
> Coalition is a global, privacy by design, contact tracing app to stop the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Coalition App alerts you if you have crossed paths or spent time with another user showing symptoms, or those who have tested positive for the virus.
<br>Instead of using your location data, Coalition uses secured bluetooth to protect your privacy.  Your information stays anonymous and private, and isn't shared with anyone without your permission.
<br>Only when you confirm that you are sick, does Coalition share an anonymous ID with others who you have come into contact with.
<br>We believe that citizens can help fight pandemics without giving up their privacy, Coalition is the first step to a pandemic free future.

> I like the level of privacy assured and I recommended it on NextDoor. But I have a question. As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron 👍<br> :date: __2020-04-25 02:24:34__

Privacy isn't much of a concern to you or your company. I definitly came to the right conclusion about this app. I saw your previous reply before you deleted it. I'm just a user.

### Description
> The Intermountain Connect Care app allows you or your child to visit with an Intermountain Healthcare clinician for certain urgent care conditions using your phone or tablet.  If you have cold or flu symptoms, sinus pain, sore throat, painful urination, a minor rash or skin issue, upset stomach, or other minor symptoms, use Connect Care 24/7/365 to quickly and conveniently get the care you need from wherever you are – just $59 a visit.  Some insurance plans accepted.
<br>Connect Care is a convenient, affordable way to get care from Intermountain clinicians. Our highly-trained, board certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants have many years of experience in urgent care, clinics, and hospitals, and are specially trained to provide care using telehealth. Your doctor will also be able to see the results of that visit in your medical record, and can incorporate it into your overall care. Depending on the issue at hand, the provider can diagnose, suggest follow up, and prescribe medication, when appropriate.
<br>Connect Care is not appropriate for all conditions. If you are unsure of whether you are having a life-threatening medical emergency, or are experiencing any of the following, please go to your nearest ER:
<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Uncontrolled bleeding
<br>• Sudden or severe pain
<br>• Coughing / vomiting blood
<br>• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
<br>• Sudden dizziness, weakness, change in vision, slurred speech, numbness, or other neurological changes
<br>• Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea
<br>• Changes in mental status, such as confusion
<br>• Assault, physical or sexual abuse, or child abuse
<br>Additional information about the Connect Care service can be found here: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/urgent-care/connect-care/

> I wasn't too impressed. The wait times were comparable to instacare, but at least I didn't have to sit in a waiting room full of sick people for 3 hours.

> The app itself is well made, but my experience made me ask myself "What's the point?". I have a sore throat and my ears have been bothering me for awhile so I finally decide to give this thing a shot. There is an option within the app that specifically states sore throat/ear problems. I get in touch with the provider and they tell me that both of those things require an in person evaluation. This is the most minor thing a person could have. If you can't diagnose it on the app what's the point?<br> :date: __2019-09-28 13:47:58__

> Why there is no summary or report of the appointment? The appointment was okay, the Dr. said she was gonna send in a request for OTC meds to my pharmacy, got there to pick it up, but of course it wasn't there and they had no idea and since it is OTC just go and pick it up. But what?! No details were given by the Dr about the type of meds and there is no record of it anywhere in the app. So basically the only way yo find out is to have another appointment for another $40....<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:15:45__

> This app is garbage and so is the desktop version. I've been waiting an hour and a half and it just keeps glitching and kicking me out of my spot in line.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | UW Medicine |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UW+Medicine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UW+Medicine) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was routed into this after calling a UW primary care. Initial experience was okay. Then tried to reconnect after a couple of weeks. Waited in queue for 3 days only to be dumped out after hours of waiting each day. Do the Drs. know how many patients are in their queue? When they quit, patients just seem to get cut off. On third day app tried to transfer me to a different Dr. but just cycled endlessly. Seems like Drs. can't finish their queues rationally.<br> :date: __2020-03-20 22:59:46__

> The clinic is a rip-off. The Doctors are subcontractors who can't help you with anything UW and just read you Mayo Clinic sparknotes. They couldn't answer anything about Covid-19 testing/screening even though they list th at as a feature in the app. It's a waste of $35 dollars and is practically fraud considering how they rush your meeting while dodging every question as "They Don't Know". Worse yet I called the UW Helpline and they falsely claimed that this was nessasary for appointments now.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 19:15:10__

> Could not locate my record..??<br> :date: __2020-05-27 18:23:44__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. Don't be deceived because it says UW Medicine! The UW has partnered with American Well(Amwell) in Boston and they run this clinic. Saw a virtual "DR" who was worthless for 3/4 minutes. He ordered a prescription for me but never transmitted to pharmacy. Amwell even "double dipped" into my bank account also. Beware, beware, beware of this app and don't use. It's not UW Drs that you get to see! Update: UW is cutting ties with Amwell on June 30, 2020. Yay!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 23:08:01__

> I had all the symptoms for covid except feverish temperature. Since it was difficult to get an appt at the dr. I decided to use the app to get checked, i was on the wait line for a good hr till my phone screen turned off. I opened my phone again, the app had refreshed so i had to register my patient info, symptoms,etc again. I was 31st person on the wait list, my screen timed out again and this happened another 2-3 times over 5hrs till i just gave up.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:03:39__

> Does not function, forced to rely on an app that spits me out of the queue. AWFUL.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 00:00:32__

> When I was signing up, I didn't know that there is a word limit so I tried to abbreviate and by the time I press continue, it says, my time expired so I started again. Then I started waiting under Dr Rueda at 11:47 am and by 1:23 pm I received a message that the Dr is no longer available. What? Why? Patients are in pain why the added pain.

> Garbage. Waited for more than two hours with a sick kid, got bounced around to different providers before finally getting to the front of the line and the doctor was no longer available. This is not stable enough to be in production.<br> :date: __2020-03-16 05:51:51__

> In waiting room for OVER TWO HOURS when kicked out of queue (started at #19) when showed I was at #5,. App declared provider no longer available. Logged in 3 minutes later and am now #21 FOR THE SAME PROVIDER. Customer svc at 7pm Pacific time rings a few times, then busy signal. UW if you see these reviews, please consider a different vendor for thi service. They fail at service delivery, user friendliness factor and tech support. I diagnose them as DOA.<br> :date: __2020-03-14 03:24:34__

> Always a pleasure, the doctor's are so sweet and kind and even chatted to get to know me and shared a piece of their life making us relatable and all of us are human and these day's things seem harder and this service saves my mind and body by not having to leave my home for something "simple" they can help me with online.

After getting the card approved finally, was able to connect with doctor after two attempts. Dr was bear personable and asked all the right questions. Was a good experience. My theory is that the data connection needs to be at a high connection speed as this app uses a lot of data. On Verizon here so usually isn't an issue.<br> :date: __2019-12-31 18:13:56__

> Everyone situation is different. If anything happens outside of the patient or doctors control be aware that you may have to pay for the visit like I did. I reached out to customer service about the situation and after 2 weeks I was told I still had to pay when clear communication with the doctor showed that the app was the fault. So be aware if you have a problem you may be still have to pay which isn't right.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 20:49:42__

> I had Covid19 in july 2020. I was atended 3 times, by 2 doctors. They prescribed antibiotics and fever-pain medicine. My point is, I told both doctors I was 2 weeks with fever, not getting better, but they kept saying I "eventually would be better". After 2 weeks, I started feeling short of breathness, when standing up. I decided go hospital. There, in half hour, they found 2 lungs compromised by pneumonia, and imediatelly started antibiotics. In 4 days I was back home.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:24:41__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Mend VIP, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.mendfamily.com](http://www.mendfamily.com) |
| **Email** | brandon@mendfamily.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mend+VIP,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mend+VIP,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I recommend this instead of going to a walk in doctor or your regular provider. During the coronavirus . I know people are scared to go to the doctor right now.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City Practice Group of New York, LLC |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | aftercare@citymd.net |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__

| **Developer**  | TherapeuticsMD |
| **Website**  | [https://www.therapeuticsmd.com](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com) |
| **Email** | amiller@therapeuticsmd.com |
| **Physical address**  | [951 Yamato Road Suite 220, Boca Raton, FL 33431](https://www.google.com/maps/search/951%20Yamato%20Road%20Suite%20220,%20Boca%20Raton,%20FL%2033431) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great service, app can be a bit annoying, but it's full of useful information<br> :date: __2020-07-20 22:40:40__

> Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.<br> :date: __2018-10-01 01:48:41__

> Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5<br> :date: __2018-09-28 06:26:18__

> The app works great for scheduling and getting regular updates, but I wish 
I could access the care plans from within the app, rather than needing to 
go to the website; it makes me question why I should use the app over the 
website.<br> :date: __2018-05-04 18:36:50__

> Thought I would give it a try and was pleased. Showed up early in their window. Noted they claim they work with Cogna but not sure. For me the convenience was well worth the extra price over sitting in some ready center. Will use this service again.<br> :date: __2018-03-06 22:59:40__

> Great app, I needed the flu shot asap the doc showed up gave me the shot all done with in 10 minutes. I will definitely be using the heal app again.<br> :date: __2018-02-19 18:00:59__

> Ive heard about this app on Dr. Drews show. I belive this app has alot of potential but its not available in moreno valley. When can we expect more areas???<br> :date: __2016-05-23 20:04:57__

> There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:49:22__

> Waiting patiently for HEAL to come to my area in Florida!<br> :date: __2019-10-29 03:29:26__

> My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2018-12-04 20:06:26__

> When entering birthday, a required field, the only method is using the pop up calendar which defaults to today's date and only let's you go back one month at a time, so if you are 30 years old, you need to tap the back arrow at least 360 times to get to your birthday, really? Why not allow someone to just type it in?? No healthy person would want to do this let alone a sick person. Terrible UI design.<br> :date: __2017-11-25 07:58:07__

> There is no services in the Las Vegas,  NV valley @ all.  We need the doctor sevices here.  We have to wait 2 to 3 months to get in for appointments.  It is a shame or waiting in line @ Urgent care for 2 or 3 hours..<br> :date: __2016-11-01 21:15:32__

> This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...<br> :date: __2019-08-20 22:15:47__

> The app has not allowed me to select a date for appointments for two months. It freezes and I have to close the app entirely, then call anyway to make my appointments. The frustration compounds when appointments are cancelled and I have to repeat the process.<br> :date: __2019-07-18 03:08:25__

> Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the "schedule a service" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?<br> :date: __2018-12-05 18:14:31__

> The service is terrific but the app is no longer working well. I have to use the website rather than the app to schedule my appointments.<br> :date: __2018-09-23 18:26:18__

> Live in Walnut Creek. One side of the street has service, other side doesn't. Mind blown!<br> :date: __2018-01-13 20:25:11__

> I'm trying to use it because I am sick but it won't let me save any of my information on it on the profile everytime I hit the save button it just spins a circle like it saving but then if I go back out of it because it does nothing afterwards it just cleared everything out and nothing gets saved so I really never got to use the app at all<br> :date: __2017-09-12 18:56:17__

> App doesn't work.  Actually needed it last week and it failed.  Wound up going to the local urgent care instead.  Waste of time to even use it...<br> :date: __2017-04-27 20:41:02__

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Isn't clear about how much they will charge<br> :date: __2020-11-23 18:50:35__

> I have had numerous problems with getting the prescriptions prescribed during my and my husband's visits. I was on hold with the prescription health line for 50 mins, with an expected wait time 55 mins when it changed my wait time 65 additional minutes! I had to check in to the app and see another doctor, paying more money to get my prescription sent to the right pharmacy. My husband's prescription information is not in the email they sent, the phramacy doesn't have it, on hold for 25mins now...<br> :date: __2020-05-27 16:37:58__

> I will say upfront, this will totally depend on provider, but using this app can be a total waste of your time and $59. You may find a provider who is dismissive and you may end up at an actual doctor's office, as I did. There is no follow-up mechanism, so once you pay for that visit, you are on your own...sick or not.<br> :date: __2018-01-27 16:09:04__

> A three minute conversation for $59.00.<br> :date: __2018-01-25 18:03:46__

This last time, the provider called me, but I just ended up getting their voicemail. Really crappy system. Blue Cross should use the $10,000 a year I pay them in insurance premiums to make an app that works!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-07-18 22:09:24__

> I need to see a doctor, I could have Covid. I put in all my info, wait for an hour, then get told they couldn't find my insurance info and a visit will be $59 after they already accepted my insurance. This app is so beyond frustrating. Absolutely worthless.<br> :date: __2020-04-12 21:03:16__

> You have the privilege of waiting hours for a 3rd rate dr to see you and then you will never be able to contact them if you have any questions or need changes, Its the ideal set up.<br> :date: __2020-03-31 23:40:48__

> 0 stars This app is a joke. You wait 40 minutes to see a doctor then get kicked out (doctor is no longer avaliable) then try to make another appointment and are told you must finish the first appointment before continuing. Not to mention when you finally do get an appointment the app doesn't work with your speaker.<br> :date: __2020-02-09 15:52:24__

### Description
> Welcome to the NALCHBP Telehealth Urgent Care. This app allows you to have a face-to- face visit with a qualified medical professional 24/7 on your mobile device with no appointment or referral needed. All providers are licensed and board-certified doctors, including pediatricians, who can diagnose, recommend treatment, prescribe medically necessary medications and provide a sick slip for school or work. Some of the conditions treated include:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cold and flu symptoms
<br>• Sinus congestion
<br>• Fever
<br>• Headaches
<br>• Pinkeye
<br>• Insect Bites
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Cuts and scrapes
<br>• And much more!
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Request a visit - Open the NALCHBP Telehealth app and create an account. Log in and choose an available doctor by reviewing their provider profile. This details their spoken languages, state licensure, board certifications, professional affiliations, clinical interests and education. You will be asked to provide medical history for the patient, indicate what pharmacy you use and pay your $10 copayment for the visit.
<br>Talk to a doctor – Within minutes, the doctor you have chosen reviews your medical history and your virtual visit begins. The doctor will discuss the issue with you, answer your questions and recommend next steps. If a prescription is medically necessary, it will be submitted to a local pharmacy of your choice. The average visit length is 10 minutes.
<br>After the visit – Clinical notes about the visit will be available on your account for sharing with your primary care provider or for your records. Any prescription or sick slip written may also be found there.
<br>Your NALCHBP Telehealth account is also available online at www.nalchbptelehealth.org or by calling 888-541-7706.
<br>Get the urgent care services your family needs, wherever you are, with the NALCHBP Telehealth app.
<br>Your privacy is taken very seriously. An NALCHBP Telehealth visit is secure and HIPAA compliant. This site is intended for NALC Health Benefit Plan High Option members only. Services are separate from your PPO provider network. If you are not an NALCHBP member, you will be responsible for the full cost of any services you receive from our urgent care practice.
<br>Please note that telehealth is not for emergencies. If you’re having a medical emergency, call 911.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NALC-HBP |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> COVIDaware MN is the official exposure notification app of the State of Minnesota. With the COVIDaware MN app, your phone gets notified when you may have been exposed to COVID-19. The app is built with privacy-preserving Exposure Notification technology developed by Apple and Google in partnership with the nonprofit PathCheck Foundation. COVIDaware MN exchanges anonymous Bluetooth keys with other app users when you are within 6 feet of each other for more than 15 minutes. If an app user reports they tested positive for COVID-19, the phones they exchanged keys with are anonymously notified. The notifications let Minnesotans know when they should take extra care and get tested. Nobody ever knows your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you.
<br>COVIDaware MN is made available by the State of Minnesota to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Like wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands, it adds another layer to our defense against the virus. No single layer is completely effective by itself, but when used together, they make us all safer. The app is part of a comprehensive contact tracing initiative managed by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). If you test positive for COVID-19, an MDH contact investigator will provide a test verification code you enter into the COVIDaware MN app. After you enter the verification code, other app users will be anonymously notified that they were near someone who has recently tested positive. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been carefully inspected by privacy and security experts. For complete information, visit https://covidawaremn.com.
<br>Help us slow the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota by sharing COVIDaware MN with your friends and family. Let’s be COVID aware, MN!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Minnesota |
| **Website**  | [https://covidawaremn.com](https://covidawaremn.com) |
| **Email** | covidawaremn@state.mn.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>VIBRATE** | Normal | Allows access to the vibrator. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Very easy and personal.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 01:18:37__

> So far, I can't tell, but tomorrow I go to hospital. I expect it will go off like crazy there. Not sure what the range is...6'? 20'? For airborne virus, 6' is no where near enough distance. I surmized that in January 2020, based on YouTube reports of medical analyst Dr. John Campbell. Check his channel out.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 19:44:24__

> Seems like a great idea, but the makers didn't think about this fully before releasing it. It sends a push notification everytime it checks to see if your exposed, without any way of changing it to only alert if potentially exposed. It just went off at 01:30 (in the morning) and all it was doing was checking, which isn't cool. Also, you actually have to add your test results, so someone who's positive still might be considered negative on the app. I'd give 5 stars otherwise.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 08:36:33__

> This app was totally amazing, it was sending my Meta Data all over the world. It even showed me that my neighbor was exposing him self to Covid with a un-natural hand sanitizer pump that doubles as an omelette maker. Keep up the good work. It's a winner for me.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 04:18:23__

> Every time this app does a check for exposures, it adds a file in my downloads. One day alone had 40 checks/40 files downloaded. These are a waste of space. Otherwise, i like the theory of this app, hopefully more people download it so it can actually do its job.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 02:51:26__

> So what is a verification code and how do you get one and from whom? A help function or more explanation is needed.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 02:33:56__

> Has only one notification type called "Exposure Notification" which fires everyday/night on exposure database updates. Had to silence this annoyance, but that also silences legit exposures! More fundamental flaws: doesn't account for PPE or if barriers between people, & relies on voluntary positive test input rather than MDH registry. Good: No location permissions required. App Info screens shows "No permissions requested". Double blind anon ID system is good. No BT issues like others.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 14:20:18__

> Needs a date range for exposure. Like the app, easy to use, pleasant interface. However, I was exposed about a month ago. It alerted me correctly, but it never cleared/updated the exposure notice. It says "Possible exposure 7-14 days ago". So after your first possible exposure, you'll be tempted to ignore it. It would be more effective if it either said "Possible exposure between "11/14 and 11/21" or simply added a timestamp to each exposure notification.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:54:39__

> Really you're putting out an app with no dark mode? Have you not paid attention to any other applications or operating system pushes and updates? I love staring into a flashlight.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:05:07__

> I'm not sure that this app is really doing anything useful. The way it's set up is completely voluntary. So even if a user has Covid-19, they don't actually have to record it. And what about the people who don't download the app and use it? I'm not convinced that this app is accomplishing it's intended purpose.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 14:19:09__

> I wish there was a way to effectively use it and not have bluetooth on 24/7.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 08:54:01__

> So I got a positive test; the app REFUSES my code saying that theres an error or that something went wrong i deleted the app; redownloaded it; cleared the cache and nothing works but the MDH wanted me to download the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 02:19:23__

> Very poorly engineered. The fact that there is only one notification category is a problem in-and-of itself. That my downloads list is full of exposure check files is another. Other reviews complain about requiring completely new setup every time a needed service is disabled and re-enabled. Overall, the functionality is important, but I cannot endorse the engineering effort here.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:37:47__

> I think this app is fine. However I live in a boarder area MN WI, and WI also has a tracking app. I can only use one at a time, not both. For me this is a problem. Isn't there a way you can create them to work at the same time and give people like me better coverage?<br> :date: __2020-12-26 13:51:11__

> Verification code is not work.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 06:19:01__

> Marketing the launch, this listing, and info via the app itself could use improvements. User is instructed most explicitly in receiving notifications, and not the other major function - reporting. Please include in how-to and link in more places to the FAQ where this entire part is even touched on. Why does the app say "Verify your diagnosis"? You literally already have your diagnosis from your doctor. Why not "send" or "report"? Thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-18 01:21:17__

> Didn't all around like because of the constant notifications even with the Bluetooth off.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 05:41:09__

> After having setup the app, now when I start it, it just shows the splash screen.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:53:31__

> An expected disappointment. The app itself is truthful that is doesn't save ur location or personal info .... ( I checked in my settings and looked at the app permissions - none)... but that statement is true only because CovidAware isn't , Google is .. on Android 10 and below , isn't that like almost every device . Smh . The app would be good if it wasnt on the Google platform .<br> :date: __2020-12-06 16:48:18__

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I believe you have a very good interface and navigation. THE MAIN ISSUE: I did not understand that another app needed to be downloaded. My assumption in designing these types of umbrella apps in my career is how to inform the users. From device, operating systems, connections, infor. required, all these moving parts integrated to keep the end user's from feelings of failure, duplication, last min. changes. I did a study the amount of time a consumer will stand in front of an ATM 7.3 sec or leave<br> :date: __2020-11-19 01:09:43__

> Teladoc works as well as any other video chat app. Get in get out get back to bed.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 16:47:20__

> Great Audio, but I could not see my doctor in the video box for my appointment? It would of been nice to have a clear audio and video screen of my doctor for my medical appointments which are very important to my health and well-being. Most importantly, my doctor was able to communicate with me and address everything in regards to my Teleconference appointment this morning. Thank you- TG<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:34:59__

> Great! Easy to use with a little lag time<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:47:51__

> This app is very convenient, and I really enjoy being able to get in contact with my physician without leaving my home. Only downer is that its not compatible with chrome books. I would like to be able to use it on the chrome book, as it's my main 'laptop's. Besides that, I have no complaints.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 22:51:18__

> Very survey heavy. One can't just talk to their Doctor, they have to jump through hoops first.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 23:14:05__

> Disconnected twice while in "Waiting Room." Very frustrating for me to have to go back through the whole process of registering for the visit - does the system save my responses when I registered for this appt the first time? WHY, OH WHY do I have to listen to "Katy" tell me how awesome telehealth is. AGAIN?!? Throws off the doctor's schedule while I am logging back in AGAIN and AGAIN to get to the visit. And the screens I see say the doctor canceled my visit. She didn't. This app did.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 19:32:34__

> I've concluded, in an educated way, that 50% of computer programmers are incapable. High paid incompetents at that. Their projects are, essentially, infinite do-loops with no escape. This Virtual Care is a classic example as during a medical PANDEMIC such a medical app should receive the attention of the best of the best, but NO, it is not. Worst of the worst?? What a tragedy. PLEASE find another company to take on completing this app and don't pay for this, heretofore, piece of garbage.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:15:39__

> Answering the same questions week after week is annoying. Covid questions for Virtual Visits?? Seriously??!! People have a .02% of catching it and an even lesser % of it being deadly. Do you really think it's gonna transfer thru a phone? js<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:00:55__

> Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:41:28__

> Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it<br> :date: __2020-10-27 20:39:40__

> There are usually technical glitches - audio, video, failure to connect.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 16:25:13__

> I live in Evansville, Indiana. Which app and portal do I need to use for St Vincents outpatient login<br> :date: __2020-08-04 20:35:13__

> The app has a tendency to drop the connection and can take a while to reconnect. This dropping and reconnecting takes time away feom the patient and provider and is very inconvenient. It also tends to not reconnect the video or freezes up. I don't know how new the app it but it has some bugs that need to be worked out. I have not had a session yet were the app has not dropped everything.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 18:53:45__

> Update 6/19/20: The developer reached out and we just had an online 1:1 feedback/user experience interview. I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:33:43__

> Visit froze 3 times. Kind of irritating.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:44:17__

> Communication not loud enough. Hard to hear and I have good ears other than that it was good<br> :date: __2020-06-10 20:15:31__

> sucks! trying to download it since my laptop had microphone problems, and this still trying to download. I have missed my appointment already. Can they pay attention and fix this issues?<br> :date: __2020-06-04 22:06:40__

> Needs to be updated since its being used more now for scheduled video visits with primary and specialty providers sits more user friendly.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 13:18:13__

> All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???<br> :date: __2020-12-23 18:37:38__

> App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the "sent" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 15:34:50__

> Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:42:09__

> App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 15:27:27__

> Keeps freezing an breaking up.hard to hear...<br> :date: __2020-06-02 19:48:36__

> The app borders on a scam i was under the orders of a doctor taking 2 medications perscribed by the doctor for a sinus infection i needed to contact my doctor for further concerns i was having but because it was simply online care i guess versus being actually treated i was not allowed by the management to get my doctors contact information not only would i never give these people another dime of my money i would not recomend it to anyone else either.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Baptist Health Virtual Care Clinic |
| **Website**  | [https://www.baptist-health.com/](https://www.baptist-health.com/) |
| **Email** | kevin.ehemann@baptist-health.org |
| **Physical address**  | [9601 Baptist Health Drive Little Rock, Arkansas 72205](https://www.google.com/maps/search/9601%20Baptist%20Health%20Drive%20Little%20Rock,%20Arkansas%2072205) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Baptist+Health+Virtual+Care+Clinic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Baptist+Health+Virtual+Care+Clinic) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.
<br>Your voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>How WA Notify works:
<br>When devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.
<br>How WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Washington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.
<br>State law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Washington Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | wanotify@uw.edu |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Washington+Department+of+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Washington+Department+of+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> It's been a few escrering moment but, better get the alert than the 🤒.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 03:15:43__

> Too soon to tell but could be very useful. They need to have a share that you can choose which app store to refer people Apple or Google. This one just sends a Google link which is useless for my wife and daughter. Hopefully they will add this. The real key is getting enough people to use it in this paranoid, conspiracy following world. Thanks for the quick response and good luck!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 05:30:16__

> This app doesn't track you! Google does that. The more downloads the better it will work. Get it!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 04:49:24__

> Easy to install<br> :date: __2020-12-21 09:46:57__

> Would be move convenient were it an implant. Maybe next year. Regardless, this app will make it easier to earn credits and to locate suitable breeding mates.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 07:40:24__

> Keep it up to date as this is going to be 6 to 9 more months long. Permissions are actually at an os level for both Android and ios, meaning you probably got an os update that you opped into in July or August. Go to settings, search for Contact, and exposure tracing will come up.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 08:20:33__

> Pierce County public health finally reached me for my interview today (12/26), over 10 days after testing posirive, but that is not the app's fault.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 03:33:19__

> "When someone in WA state tests positive for COVID-19 and public health reaches out to them, they will be asked if they have WA Notify and given a verification code. With surging cases, this may take several days." => Seriously? It takes you several days to generate a verification code? And I'm paying taxes for this kind of unprofessionalism? Gov. Inslee, please fire the team that is unable to generate codes instantly for people to add to the app and hire someone better.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 19:05:39__

> Downloaded when there was only 1500 other downloads and am so happy to see this app over 100k downloads now! Helps make me believe in doing this.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 15:24:58__

> A lot like pokemon go only you don't want to catch any.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 05:47:52__

> Update: I restarted my phone and was able to install WA Notify afterwards. It seems pretty straight forward to use. Old Review: Couldn't get it to install. Acted like it was installing, but the app didn't. Android 8 on unlocked Sony phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 00:10:56__

> I like the idea but it's a little hard on my older battery. I have to idle it when I'm by myself, like in my car. Even if I forget to turn it back on it's still better than not running it at all. I hope more people use it, the more the better.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 19:22:15__

> Update: It took 4 tries to install it but it is finally working on my phone, if you are having issues I would uninstall and try again. This is not working on my Samsung A20 Android phone. It appears to download but just keeps coming back to the download page when I try to open it.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 03:36:07__

> I will be sharing this app to friends and family as I wish to do my part in "flattening the curve." I really hope more people gets this app. I noticed some people commenting that they can't turn on notifications. From what I understand is; if you tested positive, you MUST inform the facility where you tested, that you have this app so that they can generate a "code" that you can enter on the app. I hope everyone picks up on this. 🤞<br> :date: __2020-12-01 09:09:41__

> Thanks for the creation and release of this. Found it a little difficult to find a link to download it however. Hope it helps, It should.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 05:12:37__

> Just got this so too soon to rate, but I have a question. I am an urgent care provider testing patients for COVID so will definitely be in proximity to positive cases. I wish this app had a setting for when you are at work where exposures are protected and another for when you are away from work where exposures may be unprotected.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 03:18:41__

> Need to fix the battery drain on the app<br> :date: __2020-12-29 22:15:48__

> The concept is good. I need to be able to put in co-workers who have tested positive but dont use the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:47:26__

> I think this app will be more useful if more people use it. People are afraid you are tracking their movement's. Need more advertising! The conspiracy theory people will never use it. Sane people will. Thank You<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:41:03__

> I echo Josh McAllister's comments. Recently tried to upload my test result which came to a dead end with the elusive "verification code".<br> :date: __2020-12-18 17:23:03__

> Havent had none<br> :date: __2020-12-15 18:36:19__

> I like the idea and the app itself seems fine but I don't like keeping my Bluetooth on, so I'm installing.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:54:49__

> Phone only connects to my car for hands free sometimes since installing<br> :date: __2020-12-07 06:29:34__

> This app would be better on a new phone. I have android vs. 9 and it says I have to have both location and bluetooth on for it to work. Newer versions don't require location, apparently. Leaving location on drains my battery and I don't really want it on unless I am actively using it for maps. Even if I turn location and bluetooth on and off depending on when I go out or not, it is not clear if I will receive notifications or not when at home (where I spend most of my time working).<br> :date: __2020-12-05 18:50:38__

> Nice concept, but poor execution on letting the public know it is available, and letting them know how the app works and what safeguards are in place to protect their privacy. To many people think the app will share personal information, so are unwilling to download it. This is making the app unusable as it was designed to be used. If only one person out of a hundred has downloaded it and is using it, then what use is having it on your phone?<br> :date: __2021-01-01 09:30:17__

> Had to uninstall to fix bluetooth connection problems with Fitbit and car audio bluetooth<br> :date: __2020-12-23 07:59:57__

> App seems like it would be useful, but you need a verification code to give a positive result, and nobody knows how to get this code. My friend tested positive and I didn't receive any alert after being near her because she didn't get any info about a verification code, even when she asked about it. Being able to self report would make this much more useful.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 01:52:58__

> Wish I didn't have to have my bluetooth on for it work.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 06:24:46__

> As big of a joke as our leaders! SMH<br> :date: __2020-12-07 11:01:49__

> The verification code is next to impossible to get. Whatcom County doesn't seem to know much about how to produce the code or don't seem to care. Perhaps the number from the test results should be a code number.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 18:17:01__

> Day 2 of trying to download this app through Goggle. Keep getting that app is pending & won't complete downloading. Waste of time & battery power<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:19:56__

> Great idea, but the execution needs improvement. Bluetooth function must be on all the time to get accurate notification. My bluetooth drains my battery so that's not going to work. Why can't the app communicate within itself to identify if another user has been nearby and has received a positive test? Also, if a person has all the symptoms they should be able to self report. I appreciate the states making an effort but this needs to be on a national level for people who need to travel.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 19:47:55__

> I received a call 8 hours after doing a Covid test and was told I was positive but no one knew about the verification code for this app. This app is pointless if not all hospitals to include the military know how to use it or know how to provide the access code.

> They need to state that they don't prescribe certain medications even though they are not a controlled substance. I got charged $39 to be told they don't prescribe the medications I was needing. No, they are not controlled substances. I am just without a vehicle and have been without my meds 3 weeks plus having to change doctors due to change from Medicaid to Blue Cross.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Children’s Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.childrens.com/](http://www.childrens.com/) |
| **Email** | childrensole@gmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State’s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices.

> Simple, clean design, unobtrusive. Set it and forget it. All the app's queries are visible for any curious users. IDs are anonymized, good privacy, no risk. If you get a positive test result, use the app to anonymously report so that anyone that had been in proximity to you knows they should get tested too. This is a very easy tool to help end the pandemic.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 00:39:36__

> Very helpful 🙂<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:27:24__

> I am happy this app is made now. I have seen many other states have this for a while Anyway I hope this app improving updates with a little more specific information about the exposure. For instance, how far are we from the person who is covid-19 positive? How long ago were we exposed to that person? Also the positive covid-19 is still a little murky because does it mean the person is sick or just asymptomatic carrier? And some more specific information to gauge the severity.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 07:26:19__

> Would be nice to keep track of all negative results as well.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 04:36:15__

> Great Covid-19 app<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:59:37__

> I wish this app had been made available long ago, but better late than never. I'm docking 1 star because there is no way of knowing if it is working. Some other states' apps show the time stamp from the last scan. This app would be improved by adding such a feature to reassure the users that it is working. About GPS- Apparently Android 6+ requires GPS enabled to do a lower energy usage Bluetooth scan. The developers should clarify tha GPS is required, but that location isn't recorded or kept.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 19:56:05__

> DD214<br> :date: __2020-12-16 09:20:04__

> The nevada one sux so I had to use an app made by the closest state to me (california). 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️🙃<br> :date: __2020-12-15 12:09:10__

> And will everyone be honest if they in fact contract it? Out of fear of persecution? I hope for the sake of all, we are. AND for everyone tripping on the location ordeal, they have to be able to access the location in order to release accurate warnings. Unless youre a drug dealer, or a fugative on the lam avoiding prosecution from the long arm of the law, what's the big deal? You have something to hide? This is about the greater good, its not only all about you.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 21:14:27__

> Notifications didn't work at first, but I got a notification saying update Google Play services and now it works. Meanwhile, I want to remind everyone that covid is deadlier than the flu, especially since there's no vaccine available yet. Also, even if you're young and healthy, you could come into contact with people who are older or immunocompromised, who could get pretty sick. So it's good to know if you have covid so you can stay at home. Let's work together to end this pandemic sooner!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 04:12:10__

> Before posting statistics on survival rates, please cite the source of your data and have a basic understanding of STATISTICS. The data collected is essential to combating the virus. You can't measure what you don't know!<br> :date: __2020-12-11 21:23:48__

</p>

> I just installed the app. I see no reason for my GPS to be on when I am at home. My plan is to turn on my phone's GPS when I am in a public place, like the supermarket. I will turn off the GPS when I get back in my car for the drive home. I am giving the app just 3 stars because it's forcing me to leave my Bluetooth on. But I often turn off my phone at night. I hope there's a setting to receive any notifications only during the day. I will have to check that out.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:27:22__

> Not sure what this app is supposed to be doing but as long as it's the virus is not in my area I can live with it<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:54:42__

> Someone showed me their positive result yet it still says that I haven't been exposed. I wear multiple masks and wash my hands frequently, but a careless person could be in danger.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 05:40:18__

> waiting for first alert<br> :date: __2020-12-31 05:42:37__

> It would be helpful if you gave one some kind of feedback about how well it is working. E.g. how many unique bluetooth connectors today? How many were to phones running the app? And how many positives.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 22:57:43__

> Edit: I got a notification today. I could notify others, but the app doesnt let you know if the notification went through or not. Maybe this app works for others, but I tested positive for COVID-19 a few days ago, called the number that they suggested, and I still havent received a verification code to allow me to report my case to others. I like the idea of this app, but I have proof of a positive case, yet I still cannot report it to the app<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:40:58__

> Hard to rate cause it is dependent upon others downloading the app, keeping their bluetooth on and advising if they are diagnosed as having covid.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 21:51:05__

> Three stars based on there's no way to know if it actually works as described. Docked two stars because all info leading up to the launch said no GPS necessary for it to work. When I checked the APP after installation, text plainly stated "Notification OFF; no notification until GPS Location turned on" (--paraphrasing) So I will see if there's any affect on battery life; if severe or annoying, may uninstall. Don't worry though; i never go anywhere!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:34:56__

> App reports it used 0% battery however the system status showed bluetooth used 34% of the battery. That never happened prior to installing this app<br> :date: __2020-12-17 23:58:46__

> Rated 3 stars for the following reasons. 1) This app assumes the person who tested positive will actually enter the code. 2) The person who tested positive is dumb enuph to not self quarantine and knowingly risk exposing others.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 10:26:26__

> Unlikely to work. Hasn't for me. I installed this app due to a prompt randomly. I configured it with full access to everything. A week later a breakout occured at work and positive tests resulted in some departments at my business. I got zero notifications at all. We find ourselves in the center of a venne diagram where the same people who are deniers and doubters who won't share on the app are crossing over the people who get sick most often.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 10:57:29__

> The app is really good and that's why I gave you a two-star but I took away three stars and because no one's using the app and you need to have Corona results you put in it. It would need over a couple million people using it and giving their results. Sadly only 500k people are using it so far from here<br> :date: __2020-12-30 01:58:34__

> This app needs the option to report if you have been near another user running this app but not tested positive so you can verify the app is actually doing something. Right now it just sits there and we "Assumbe" its working.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 15:29:26__

### Description
> Penn Highlands MyHealthNow offers online, 24/7, care you need now from anywhere.
<br>The MyHealthNow free mobile app makes connecting with a doctor fast, easy and convenient. MyHealthNow currently offers provider consults through QCareNow, an on-demand clinic providing evaluation and treatment for minor illnesses or injuries, with new services coming soon.
<br>No appointment is needed to connect with a provider on QCareNow!
<br>The average wait time is less than 10 minutes to consult with a state-licensed health provider. Visits are just $49 and may be covered by your insurance provider. An easily accessible claims receipt will be available after your visit to simplify the reimbursement claims process.
<br>In most cases, you’ll enjoy the convenience of a virtual provider visit with the added freedom to choose from a list of available experts who will provide you with a consultation, and work to diagnose your medical issue, recommend treatment and, if medically-necessary, forward your prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.
<br>When to use MyHealthNow:
<br>• Instead of visiting one of our QCare Walk-in clinics
<br>• During or after normal business hours, including nights, weekends and holidays
<br>• If your primary care physician is not available
<br>• If you are too ill to drive to a doctor’s office
<br>• If traveling and in need of medical care
<br>If you or your child is experiencing one or more of the conditions below, and you are in need of care right now, QCareNow is for you:
<br>• Flu-like symptoms
<br>• Fever
<br>• Vomiting
<br>• Coughs, colds or sinus problems
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Sprains
<br>• Back pain
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Minor eye problems
<br>• Minor cuts and abrasions
<br>• Minor aches and pains
<br>• Bladder infections
<br>• Tick and insect bites

> Easy to use fast and responsive much better than going in for little things unless you absolutely need to be seen right then and there it's a better alternative.

> Sound isn't very loud. If my house hadn't been totally quiet, I'd have never been able to hear my doctor. Trying to get this app downloaded and set up was a little aggravating but now that I got it done, this is a really neat app! So much better than having to run to the doctor! I can talk to him in the privacy of my own home. This also helps me to remember the things I want to discuss with him.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 19:40:18__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | 1Life Healthcare, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.onemedical.com](http://www.onemedical.com) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works pretty darn good to be honest, didn't know for a while but you can video chat with someone on demand, it took me about 10 minutes from tapping the thing to speaking with a clinician, neat! Also crucial was the fact that I told this guy that I had sent a message to the med team, and he was able to pull it up and see it. Well integrated and actually easy to use, which is insane for a medical app<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:23:25__

> Great medical service, pretty good app I'm a huge fan of one medical service, the app mostly upholds their high standards. At times I get notifications that I can't seem to clear, And it's difficult to manage my child's account, who's also a one medical patient on the same app. All told though, I'm pretty happy with the way the app makes finding remote care easy<br> :date: __2020-07-28 14:58:50__

> How do I create a second account or change my present one such that I can get separate messages for myself and a dependent customer on the app? I am the medical POA for the 2nd customer.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:14:24__

> The features all work well but the UX could be improved so that it's easier to figure out "what do I want to do" and then follow a clear path to receiving care from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:46:17__

> Stuck at 66% download. Not sure why. Help!<br> :date: __2020-07-02 04:59:16__

> Would be nice to be able to describe symptoms in my own words, rather than choosing from a list. Other than that, good app. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-02-28 20:49:59__

> Great app, very helpful option for video visits. I was traveling and needed a prescription and they got it to a local pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-02-04 16:23:53__

> I enjoy the (mostly) user friendly design. Medical team responds quickly to questions and requests. I'm disappointed that the app does not correctly sort medical centers by distance from me. I've enabled location tracking, but it still defaults to downtown San Francisco as my location , so I have to scroll down dozens of entries to find the locations that are actually near me.<br> :date: __2020-01-15 00:16:56__

> *Updating my review. The app team contacted me and after much back and forth got it working. The app now functions as promised.* I can't get the app to login. I can login to the website but I just keep getting a generic "something went wrong" error when trying to use the same credentials. There is no app support to contact to try and resolve this.<br> :date: __2019-11-05 11:59:47__

> This is not a mature app, but the idea is sound. I like booking appointments at any hour of the day and love the video visit feature. But, when something goes wrong, I want to know more than a generic "Uh oh! Something went wrong. Try again later." If an office was closed due to flooding, the booking error shouldn't tell me to try again. If I can't start a video visit because I have 3% battery, whatever weirdness that generates, "Uh oh[...]try again later" distracts from the real problem.<br> :date: __2019-10-17 10:36:08__

> It would be best if the app remembers the last office I went to and keeps that available on My 1med app . Also be on each page maybe. I only use the app on my android. When I see a dot by messages it should dissappear after I have looked at it. Under care plan, there needs to be an option for "other" to leave specific information. I would say....I tried to go to appointment but got lost, or it was too far, or they don't take my insurance. Love the Chat!!!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:55:21__

> Please update home screen icon to adaptive icons to fit in with android 11.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 06:40:12__

> Almost perfect. It works very well. The best of my medical apps. But unread and unread messages look almost exactly the same. The title can be bold, not bold, or grey. Hard to differentiate, even with the screen magnified.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:59:36__

> Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:30:43__

> They removed the bluetooth connection and it no longer connects to blood pressure cuffs. They did this during the last software update. This was a good capability as you didn't have to manually input blood pressure readings. One Medical I.T. should consider restoring this capability.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 23:04:12__

> Could be better in navigation and the resources it offers. I would have preferred if it looked like the desktop site<br> :date: __2020-06-07 10:59:54__

> The treat me now video call feature currently is broken for me (Google Pixel). I get an error "Uh oh looks like something went wrong" when after I request a video visit.<br> :date: __2019-10-07 06:48:13__

> Cannot take a picture of my insurance card. Camera button does not work. Using a Samsung Galaxy S10. It's been months since I last tried, but this issue has not been solved.<br> :date: __2019-09-27 13:20:01__

> The camera won't focus in the app when I try to upload pictures of my insurance card. My camera is not faulty.<br> :date: __2019-09-02 23:25:52__

> This app is pretty much trash on Android. The ability to take a clear photo of your insurance card is not possible. I have a Samsung S10. Push notifications are inconsistent. Thank goodness I get email reminders. The questionnaire is not adaptive. Respond with "None of the above" and the following prompt asks you for more details 🙄. This app has a ways to go before it's useful for more than simply booking an appointment.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 18:56:35__

> Will not load into Ipod on my phone can not delete all the messages recieved its fill my phone. Many issues too be addressed<br> :date: __2020-08-04 01:55:53__

> When an app with more than a few reviews rates higher than 4.8, something other than "app nirvana" may explain. With One Medical, it's a culture of zero tolerance for dissent or constructive criticism. Were it not for this Orwellian imposition of conformity (yes they will retaliate), both One Medical and its app might deserve 4 stars. The app (like the entity) occasionally has glitches (like the 3-year time warp). Putting all that and privacy violations aside (should we?), it can be OK.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 00:58:11__

> The app is not great. It's basically the website with no difference. Like it literally has a tab in menu which says 'Open in app' 😑. There is no way to reschedule or even look at your appointments.<br> :date: __2020-01-09 18:13:55__

> Great unless you move outside an office area. Then extremely unhelpful. Their customer service staff also play games on phone calls. Will not sign up again for the same service I can get elsewhere without paying $200 extra.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 20:51:23__

> Trash bag of an app that gets stuck on a perpetual reload screen when you sign in. Oh and it signs you out by itself. Pretty sure this app gave my phone the electronic version of covid.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 20:44:22__

> So far not good the app is slow and cumbersome....seems to do something weird to my camera<br> :date: __2020-12-08 22:06:48__

> New users: Be very careful! One Medical did not indicate that my appointment would not be covered by my insurance nor was any amount ever presented to me beforehand. For a service that is digital and online, that is outright dishonesty, which is tantamount to scamming your customers. Shame on you, One Medical!<br> :date: __2020-09-17 19:54:27__

> Forces you to use the app to book covid test. But locations don't match the website.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 19:09:52__

> Useless app. Useless staff. This app lets any doctor, PA or NP in the system contact you after you've had an initial appointment. They don't care as you get passed around getting messages from more and more inept people. They misplace things, forget things and ultimately waste your time with repetitive messages saying they're working on it. They're not. The interface is clunky. App appointments slots (compared to phone bookings) are not accurate. This app wastes time and money.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 23:26:31__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | UnityPoint Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | unitypointhealth.developers2@gmail.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UnityPoint+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UnityPoint+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> WI Exposure Notification is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of the State of Wisconsin supported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WI DHS). WI Exposure Notification helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the local and tribal public health agencies and DHS. 
<br>Using WI Exposure Notification is voluntary and free of charge. It was built with your privacy and security in mind. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively it can be in helping us contain the virus. 
<br>Once you install and activate WI Exposure Notification and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous signals with other devices. These signals, or keys, are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will remember the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will also record the signal strength, which is used to estimate the distance between two devices, as well as the duration and date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days, the keys are deleted. If a WI Exposure Notification user tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive a verification code from the State of Wisconsin.  Users must activate the verification code that is only available from the State of Wisconsin in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>WI DHS wants all app users to feel confident that, when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event to be trusted. When users choose to share a positive test result, this notifies other app users that were close enough to the infected person for a long enough period of time (approximately within 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes in a single day) that they are considered a close contact and at risk of infection. 
<br>Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps. WI DHS takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. WI DHS does not need to know where or who you are for WI Exposure Notification to work. The Wisconsin COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/privacy.htm. 
<br>Please note that WI Exposure Notification is intended for users ages 13 and up. The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

### Description
> AlohaSafe Alert is a voluntary new service that helps slow the spread of COVID-19. AlohaSafe Alert is the official exposure notification app of Hawaii and has been designed for use in Hawaii in coordination with the Hawaii State Department of Health.
<br>The goal of AlohaSafe Alert is to support the re-opening of Hawaii communities and economies.
<br>If you have enabled Exposure Notifications on your phone, whenever you are within close proximity (approximately 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes), your phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens. If that person later tests positive for COVID-19, you will receive a notification about a possible exposure. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can share these anonymous tokens, which will send a notification to anyone with whom you have exchanged tokens recently, notifying them of possible exposure.
<br>This service has been designed for use in Hawaii. This service does not collect any personally identifying information or share it with the State of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health, Apple, or Google. AlohaSafe Alert is a source of up to date COVID-19 information & guidance. The AlohaSafe Alert app was built using the open source project developed by PathCheck Foundation.
<br>Use AlohaSafe Alert to report a COVID-19 diagnosis if your area is a part of the pilot program:
<br> • Lanaʻi
<br> • Maui
<br> • Kauaʻi
<br> • Hawaiʻi
<br> • State-wide (1/6/2020)

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Hawaii Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://health.hawaii.gov/](https://health.hawaii.gov/) |
| **Email** | doh.alohasafe@doh.hawaii.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [1250 Punchbowl St. Honolulu, HI  96813](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1250%20Punchbowl%20St.%20Honolulu,%20HI%2096813) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Hawaii+Department+of+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Hawaii+Department+of+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices.

> Easy, easy, easy. The app installed in seconds. There is NO setup. It doesn't ask for any input at all. You don't need a username, password, or email address. Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:22:54__

> Good idea ... But not yet ready for prime time, methinks. After I installed it, I could no longer use my Qardio Blood Pressure machine, which also communicates via Bluetooth. So I uninstalled this Nov. 30, 2020, and the Qardio app could connect again. Possibly a coincidence. I'll try this app again in a few weeks, after they've had a chance to iron out the wrinkles. Like I said ... a good idea ... assuming that the app attracts enough users to be useful. It'll need a lot.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 08:23:53__
