## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Disclaimer 

This report has been produced independently of any parties and its only objective is to help anybody in better understanding how COVID-related apps work in practice (and compare to each other). The results of this report are limited to the specific version of the software used for running the analyses and on the various heuristics implemented in there.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

 | <img src="resources/com.proudcrowd.care___3.1/screenshot_4.png" alt="screenshot" width="300"/> 

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> This picks up most of the places I go, and I check when I get home so I can add places it has missed or change inaccurate locations, which only happens when I am in an area with a lot of stores, like a plaza. My home state has not chosen an app so I use this one.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 22:03:28__

> The early release back in April was rough (didn't log any stops for me). But it's been working well for me since about May 4. It occasionally logs more than one stop at the same location. It occasionally gets the name of the location wrong, but this is very easy to correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 06:25:30__

> Each week, 2 out of the 5 days I'm at work there's no entry. Yesterday it showed me in the middle of road halfway to work for 8.5 hours. If I stop somewhere on my way home from work, half the time it misses it. I have a Pixel 3 XL. I want to have this app work.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:21:53__

> App runs unnoticeably in the background. However, requires constant maintenance. If I go more than 2-3 days without monitoring the app, I find that it stops tracking my locations, at which point I need to go back through all intro screens as if I just installed the app (Region, Consent, Home location, etc). Back arrow on Android while in the Places You've Visited will also return to the initial menu and require passing through all intro screens again, or app will not resume tracking. Should have a warning, and consent/home location should be saved in a more permanent cache.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:23:18__

> Doesn't catch all locations, and it recorded a one hour visit to one store as 12 minutes, then would not allow correction.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:10:23__

> Quit recording anything after about three weeks.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 05:30:54__

> Inaccurate didn't track me for days sometimes. Uninstalled it, that bad.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 03:31:36__

> Location info is incorrect and incomplete. I was able to fix the incorrect info, but can't add locations. Uninstalled and reinstalled on 6/24. Tracked my location until 6/27 then nothing.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 17:28:05__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light. Some days it gives no information at all.. i reloaded it a couple of weeks ago. It worked well until July 3 then quit working, not registering any locations.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 20:23:07__

> It's not all that<br> :date: __2020-06-18 15:59:46__

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> I took care of a FEMA worker so I thought I would check out app<br> :date: __2020-07-27 23:49:33__

> It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 22:57:25__

> Great app.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 08:50:11__

> Great at giving alerts for different areas. Live posting during storms is excellent. Just be careful you don't list to many places to avoid constant updates.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 03:22:06__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad.

> No change. Even after clearing cache, rebooting phone, etc still getting multiples of same exact alerts and several alerts with little or no lead time. That's probably FEMA but still downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 22:38:27__

I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

> Well developed<br> :date: __2020-10-20 23:12:10__

> I think that if the whole country used this app we would not be in the mess we are in. People do not use their brain at all. It's common sense...you protect me I protect you. It's a proven fact that masks work. Wake up and stop being so bull headed...I've been trying to do everything that has been recommended by our Governor and have been using this app since the first day it came out. Call me a wimp, I don't care. I'm 70, a retired RN and know from experience these rules save lives.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 19:43:11__

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> This seams to not be accurate very often with locations!!<br> :date: __2020-10-14 23:37:32__

> It puts me places I never was<br> :date: __2020-10-14 16:40:06__

> I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the "No thanks" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:12:33__

> This should be integrated with the exposure notification system from Apple and Google. Without it, this app exists in its own tiny silo and won't be successful.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 05:33:30__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 01:24:33__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ADHS-Arizona Department of Health Services |
| **Website**  | [https://covidwatch.org](https://covidwatch.org) |
| **Email** | contact@covidwatch.org |
| **Physical address**  | [150 N 18TH AVE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/150%20N%2018TH%20AVE) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> There are some permissions that are not necessary, like the microphone, I disabled it. I think for this to work you need to keep the permissions to the necessary minimums. Too many people are suspicious of apps and purposes so the less you ask for the better. Our governance from state to federal proves themselves less and less trustworthy to us almost daily. Don't let your health tracker be added to that bucket.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:30:21__

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:19:06__

### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> I appreciate the efforts to curb the spread of Covid. However when I turned off my phone's location, I received a notification from Google's Exposure Notifications framework that I needed to enable location in order for the app to work. What??? Covidwise says that "No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app." I've since learned that while the app itself doesn't ask for location, Google's Exposure Notification framework (used by the app) obtains location data by using Bluetooth. This is very confusing. Please work out the kinks in messaging this. Otherwise it looks like the app is trying to do something sneaky (trying to gather and store my location data without telling me).<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:49:11__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

> This app is such an awesome start. It has never updated exposure on it's own. I have to refresh it every time. I have gone a day with no auto updates like it said it would, so I just refresh at least once a day. I wish it showed how many ids you have encountered or something cause it feels like the app isn't doing anything. It would be nice to know that it has read # nearby users and is now checking that many every refresh. It kinda feels like just an info about covid app, not a tracker.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 19:31:12__

> So the app is working dled at 5am you swipe to reload the screached 0 encounters so i think this use app is very low at this point all change review as data is available im using a stylo 5<br> :date: __2020-08-25 16:10:50__

> Downloaded the app about two weeks ago worked fine, I assume the first couple days. Now it will never reload information (it has a little time last updated at the top) it's been stuck at the same time no matter what I do.

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible. The idea of this app was good; however, it is only as good as the data that is inputted and shared to others.

I received on Exposure Notification on 8/30/2020 at 12:20pm saying No Exposure Found in the last hour. As of 8/31/2020, 12:01pm I have not received any other exposure notices. Even after one hour in the gym. 1) Why isn't this running/working? and 2)How do I manually check for exposures? 3)How frequently should I get exposures? Using a Samsung Note 8, android. Installation seemed to go just fine. Sending question to help email noted below. I very much would like to see this app be successful!<br> :date: __2020-08-31 21:09:02__

> This doesn't work, the app itself looks/seems/feels like a toy or fake, won't even show in the google play search, I had to find the website first then use the link to get to the app and in my girlfriend phone wont pass from the 3rd page "next" Samsung A20, and in my Samsung gs8 the loading update it's "meh".<br> :date: __2020-08-27 04:14:38__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Delaware Department of Health and Social Services |
| **Website**  | [https://de.gov/covidalert](https://de.gov/covidalert) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices.

> I'm from Maryland but travel to Delaware frequently. This app only works on one of my phone, the others are too old. Please expand the API to include phones down to 4.4. Also less than 100 installs (50+) indicates no one is using it at the time of review. This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less. For this type of app to be meaningful, you need to have engagement > 50% of the population or >500,000% more installs.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 21:09:32__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I don't live in Guam and don't work as a Path Check developer, so I can't judge how the EN functionality works, but as an interested consumer, I say thumbs up.<br> :date: __2020-09-11 19:29:00__

### Description
> CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Palm Beach County, Florida, a diverse community of over a million and a half people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.

### Description
> Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. 
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple’s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. 
<br>Care19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. 
<br> 
<br>The downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

> I really am sick of conspiracy theorists.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 14:51:24__

> Great info, easy to use. My only suggestion is to reduce the size of the text box on the Stats page regarding Johns Hopkins along with the logo. It takes up too much of the screen on my Android mobile device. I can only use 40% of the screen for scrolling the stats.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 01:45:27__

> Hopefully enough people use it to make it work!<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:03:29__

> I wish the information was more well organized and the map was more informative. It would be great if the map showed the amount of cases by city instead of county, more recent info, and the map on a different section of the app because I thought for a minute that there was no map, there is its just not super informative. I'd also like to see a leaderboard of what city's have the most cases and have testing areas on the map. Otherwise it's a good start in the right direction for michigan :)<br> :date: __2020-11-12 14:36:48__

> I'm giving it a try because any knowledge is better than none. It won't change my behavior. I'll still be masking and mostly staying home.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 00:18:04__

> I like the app and was surprised to see it had helpful features other than the contact tracing. Even though that is what it is intended for. It doesn't appear to use much battery, even though it hopefully is working all the time. Otherwise it would be pointless. My only problem is the stats displayed don't match the most recent data on the website. That seems simple enough for the developers to get working right.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:47:48__

> I am excited to see an app for Michigan finally available and even though I am not in the Ingham County area I wanted to check it out. I like the addition of the stats from Johns Hopkins and the added use of pins with MDHS in order for someone to list themselves as having Covid. While I did not give it 5 stars (due to just getting the app) I did want to comment and let you know that I appreaciate it.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 04:03:51__

> I think the concept of this app is a step in flattening the curve but unless all Michiganders are downloading and using this how is its effectivenes Therefore, I think requirement of the app by all with smart phones or access might make it more successful, not only Michigan but throughout the United States. Matter of fact Everywhere this is a "Global Pandemic". Pre-installment (as other widely used apps are already installed on new phones) is a good idea as well. Please Consider<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:46:35__

> Too much text, especially when you try to look at John Hopkins pages.

### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Alabama Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | alabamapublichealth@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [201 Monroe Street Montgomery, Alabama 36104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/201%20Monroe%20Street%20Montgomery,%20Alabama%2036104) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Alabama+Department+of+Public+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Alabama+Department+of+Public+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Everyone in Alabama needs to download this. It doesn't work at all. If you catch covid and use this app you get to sue the developer as well as the state of Alabama. Definitely a better payout than a stimulus check.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 16:41:29__

> We need this in society, this would help us a lot in America. Although all the comments say it's not accurate, but the reason I posted a five star review is because if they update this to work properly then everyone can at least consider using this to reduce Covid-19.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 06:04:06__

> No issues. Does this share exposure notifications with the other notification apps or only with users of this app?<br> :date: __2020-08-23 14:57:47__

> No issues downloading. I agree with a previous review, it would be more useful if it was utilized by more people. But i do feel better that this tool is avaliable! Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 14:39:51__

> Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American<br> :date: __2020-10-12 15:50:41__

> Works but Annoyed - had this for UAB support, though it kept saying I had been exposed, the problem my phone was charging at the time it said the exposure happened on 2 different days at the same time of day (late Sunday evenings) I didn't go anywhere during those timeframes. It has to be binging off one of my neighbors but I had to quarantine and not attend classes. I've now removed it.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 08:18:57__

> App questionnaire requires email verification, but doesn't work, so don't bother. If that basic feature does not work then how can you rely on it to correctly perform contact tracing?! This is not an in consequential function. Get it right!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 19:27:11__

> I just can't figure out out bc I know as many places as I have been lately I must have had some kind of course contact somewhere and haven't received 1 alert, just everything about it is confusing I don't even know if I'm even logged in correctly or whatever you're supposed to do..

> 10/25/2020 complete and total invasion of our privacy.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 16:48:19__

> The absolute state of Pandemic politicization. Hear me now: I don't fear the plague. I fear the government and private sector for whom their belief in synthetic solutions divide us from our rights like a the wake of a speedboat.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 02:09:41__

> I have this app with Bluetooth on. I have found out I've been exposed and they have the app... and crickets. Nothing.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 01:36:04__

> I live in Colorado, reading a local news story and this app pops up, annoying on that level, but moving on, I'm like heck yeah, I want to be informed about Covid locally. As the app is installing it shows it's for Alabama?!?!? How does that help me in Colorado? Pop ups are annoying to begin with, but if you're going to do it, at least get the state correct. If you can't get that right, I'm not going to put a lot of stock in your other life changing information.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 23:58:20__
