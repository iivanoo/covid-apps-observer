The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Disclaimer 

This report has been produced independently of any parties and its only objective is to help anybody in better understanding how COVID-related apps work in practice (and compare to each other). The results of this report are limited to the specific version of the software used for running the analyses and on the various heuristics implemented in there. In other words, the results of the analyzers may differ depending on the time and modalities in which they are executed.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

 | <img src="resources/com.proudcrowd.care___3.1/screenshot_4.png" alt="screenshot" width="300"/> 

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProudCrowd,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

> This picks up most of the places I go, and I check when I get home so I can add places it has missed or change inaccurate locations, which only happens when I am in an area with a lot of stores, like a plaza. My home state has not chosen an app so I use this one.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 22:03:28__

> The early release back in April was rough (didn't log any stops for me). But it's been working well for me since about May 4. It occasionally logs more than one stop at the same location. It occasionally gets the name of the location wrong, but this is very easy to correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 06:25:30__

> You should be able to type in a location when it gets it wrong. Sometimes there is no option for where you are.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 06:04:00__

> After multiple attempts, this app cannot determine my home location. Uninstalling. UPDATE 10/21/20 - It can now find my home location. Up to 3 stars. I do not see how I can see the list of locations myself.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 15:32:52__

> Every couple of weeks it takes a day off & doesn't show any locations at all for that day.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 02:59:05__

> How long do the places you visit stay on the app? Mine seem to show maybe only previous 10 days.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 23:41:30__

> Doesn't this app use the Contact Tracking System that Apple and Google developed?<br> :date: __2020-06-02 15:29:17__

> Simple app. Does what it was designed for but little else. Misses many locations and frequently has location accuracy issues. Routinely misses my home by 6 blocks. Says I have visited locations I have just driven past. Would be nice to have ability to add locations that I visited but app failed to record.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 15:52:32__

> Still isn't capturing places I've been. Was at 3 different locations today, and not one of them showing up.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 23:03:13__

> Very inconsistent with location. Can be at a location for hours and doesn't list it.<br> :date: __2020-05-16 15:20:52__

> It's a great idea, but does not log most of the places I've been. Stopped at 6 places in Bismarck and didn't log one place. And then the next time it will log the same place 4 times within a few minutes or log a place I only drove by.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 02:20:12__

> Each week, 2 out of the 5 days I'm at work there's no entry. Yesterday it showed me in the middle of road halfway to work for 8.5 hours. If I stop somewhere on my way home from work, half the time it misses it. I have a Pixel 3 XL. I want to have this app work.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:21:53__

> App runs unnoticeably in the background. However, requires constant maintenance. If I go more than 2-3 days without monitoring the app, I find that it stops tracking my locations, at which point I need to go back through all intro screens as if I just installed the app (Region, Consent, Home location, etc). Back arrow on Android while in the Places You've Visited will also return to the initial menu and require passing through all intro screens again, or app will not resume tracking. Should have a warning, and consent/home location should be saved in a more permanent cache.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:23:18__

> Doesn't catch all locations, and it recorded a one hour visit to one store as 12 minutes, then would not allow correction.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:10:23__

> Quit recording anything after about three weeks.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 05:30:54__

> Inaccurate didn't track me for days sometimes. Uninstalled it, that bad.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 03:31:36__

> Location info is incorrect and incomplete. I was able to fix the incorrect info, but can't add locations. Uninstalled and reinstalled on 6/24. Tracked my location until 6/27 then nothing.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 17:28:05__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light. Some days it gives no information at all.. i reloaded it a couple of weeks ago. It worked well until July 3 then quit working, not registering any locations.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 20:23:07__

> Idk procedure to get my phone to let this work automatically in the background, out on the east coast<br> :date: __2020-07-02 20:56:10__

> It's not all that<br> :date: __2020-06-18 15:59:46__

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

You say it's just the way it is, no, you know how it's supposed to work, so find someone to make it work correctly. This app does not trace where I been going. It does not stay open in the background. When open, it does not show where I go or been since the 23rd. I restarted phone and reinstalled app on S9+<br> :date: __2020-08-11 03:56:40__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad.

I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

It's a proven fact that masks work. Wake up and stop being so bull headed...I've been trying to do everything that has been recommended by our Governor and have been using this app since the first day it came out. Call me a wimp, I don't care. I'm 70, a retired RN and know from experience these rules save lives.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 19:43:11__

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> Resident of Rhode Island<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:39:10__

> if you don't see the icon, it's not tracking you.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 23:43:54__

> It puts me places I never was<br> :date: __2020-10-14 16:40:06__

> I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the "No thanks" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:12:33__

> This should be integrated with the exposure notification system from Apple and Google. Without it, this app exists in its own tiny silo and won't be successful.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 05:33:30__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all. Such as yesterday, I went to Narragansett, nothing shows on my location tracker at all for the last 2 days.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 01:24:33__

> Cannot get contact tracing in Crush Colvid<br> :date: __2020-08-10 20:35:33__

> Not totally accurate<br> :date: __2020-07-16 21:44:22__

> Most days the app is not picking up most of the locations I visit. Sometimes is says I did not go anywhere and I definitely did and stayed at Locations for hours. What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves. Good luck.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:41:15__

> James Wadsworth I have found the tracking to be only 75 per cent accurate.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 06:40:02__

> I mean, I get that the app is trying it's best, but it only works in Rhode island! The better news is that at least it warns u what states the coronavirus are tracked<br> :date: __2020-07-11 03:50:12__

> I appreciate this app so much that I've kept it on my phone pretty much since day 1, and have let it log my location for the chance that I catch COVID-19 and want to send it in. I just want to do anything I can to help stop the spread. However, this app accounts for 35 PERCENT of my battery usage. There's simply no need for an app to be that power-hungry, just logging my location idly. That, and the fact that it doesn't integrate Google's contact tracing technology, I have to say goodbye for now<br> :date: __2020-11-19 08:27:43__

> Location areas are not correct<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:32:35__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> There are some permissions that are not necessary, like the microphone, I disabled it. I think for this to work you need to keep the permissions to the necessary minimums. Too many people are suspicious of apps and purposes so the less you ask for the better. Our governance from state to federal proves themselves less and less trustworthy to us almost daily. Don't let your health tracker be added to that bucket.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:30:21__

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:19:06__

### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

> I appreciate the efforts to curb the spread of Covid. However when I turned off my phone's location, I received a notification from Google's Exposure Notifications framework that I needed to enable location in order for the app to work. What??? Covidwise says that "No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app." I've since learned that while the app itself doesn't ask for location, Google's Exposure Notification framework (used by the app) obtains location data by using Bluetooth. This is very confusing. Please work out the kinks in messaging this. Otherwise it looks like the app is trying to do something sneaky (trying to gather and store my location data without telling me).<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:49:11__

> Good idea, flawed execution. A person who tests positive must input a PIN that they receive from a state contact tracer to report their illness. This works great as long as the contact tracing is performed properly. Personal experience: my wife tested positive, did not hear from a contract tracer, never received a PIN. At no point did the app indicate that I had been exposed, even though I share a home with someone who tested positive. This may be an isolated case, but I've lost confidence.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 01:38:46__

> I'm gonna keep it on my phone, but i was with someone who tested positive and the app didn't catch it, so I'm pretty sure it's useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:35:18__

> Rating based on alert function rather than any more independent function or utility.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 23:00:14__

> I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own?

> Location services must be on for android devices to enable blue tooth, which is a huge drawback for me. I rarely have that turned on, and am selective as to when I have my cell radio on. It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:33:54__

> I've been using this for over 1 hour and still did not find any Pokemon. as to the app, it seems to draw down the battery. unfortunate not enough potential users, and the "where - when" for contacts seems seriously lacking. still have it running because it's all that's offered.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 05:06:02__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Couldn't reload app to get time and day to reload.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:27:23__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

> Drains your battery! I dont like to have my bluetooth on all day. I am in the medical field and am exposed to know's what, so oy would be interesting to see if i am exposed at work. Just wished it didn't drain my battery<br> :date: __2020-08-31 17:45:38__

> This app is such an awesome start. It has never updated exposure on it's own. I have to refresh it every time. I have gone a day with no auto updates like it said it would, so I just refresh at least once a day. I wish it showed how many ids you have encountered or something cause it feels like the app isn't doing anything. It would be nice to know that it has read # nearby users and is now checking that many every refresh. It kinda feels like just an info about covid app, not a tracker.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 19:31:12__

> Downloaded the app about two weeks ago worked fine, I assume the first couple days. Now it will never reload information (it has a little time last updated at the top) it's been stuck at the same time no matter what I do.

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible. The idea of this app was good; however, it is only as good as the data that is inputted and shared to others.

> I installed this app on 8/30/2020. Location and BlueTooth are on. Exposure notifications are on. I received on Exposure Notification on 8/30/2020 at 12:20pm saying No Exposure Found in the last hour. As of 8/31/2020, 12:01pm I have not received any other exposure notices. Even after one hour in the gym. 1) Why isn't this running/working? and 2)How do I manually check for exposures? 3)How frequently should I get exposures? Using a Samsung Note 8, android. Installation seemed to go just fine. Sending question to help email noted below. I very much would like to see this app be successful!<br> :date: __2020-08-31 21:09:02__

> This doesn't work, the app itself looks/seems/feels like a toy or fake, won't even show in the google play search, I had to find the website first then use the link to get to the app and in my girlfriend phone wont pass from the 3rd page "next" Samsung A20, and in my Samsung gs8 the loading update it's "meh".<br> :date: __2020-08-27 04:14:38__

> I love this idea! But... It only shows that the last check was 15 hours ago. One check is all it has done. What good is that? For those stuck on 3rd page, slide the slider in middle of the page as instructions say.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 16:09:15__

> Works as described. It does not require GPS location like some people say nor does it have permission to access local data. 100% anonymous. I wish more people used the app and the ones who have it check in. At the time of me writing this, about 5% of the people who downloaded the app actually check in, so kinda defeats the purpose but that's not the app or developers fault. I'd like it to see a reminder to check in every day if possible for future updates.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 22:11:13__

> I'm from Maryland but travel to Delaware frequently. This app only works on one of my phone, the others are too old. Please expand the API to include phones down to 4.4. Also less than 100 installs (50+) indicates no one is using it at the time of review. This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less. For this type of app to be meaningful, you need to have engagement > 50% of the population or >500,000% more installs.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 21:09:32__

### Description
> Guam Covid Alert, an app by the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services helps aid contact tracing for COVID-19 by using the privacy centric Exposure Notification System. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available.
<br>Receive alerts from the local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>The goal of Guam Covid Alert by the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities. Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Guam Covid Alert app was built using an open source project developed by PathCheck Foundation.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I like the transparency around privacy, but I wish there were external links to a credible audit of the open source code so that the in-app marketing assertions could be 3rd-party verified. I don't live in Guam and don't work as a Path Check developer, so I can't judge how the EN functionality works, but as an interested consumer, I say thumbs up.<br> :date: __2020-09-11 19:29:00__

### Description
> CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Palm Beach County, Florida, a diverse community of over a million and a half people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

> Kudos to the county for making this available for use. Can’t tell yet what needs to be improved.  It was an easy and fast install but I did have to read it carefully to see what it was doing but it doesn’t look like other apps.  Not sure what I could say to fix that though.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:50:19__

> łBecause they are very important to me and I would feel bad if I got them sick. Hopefully the app actually works! as it says it does.

> The user interface needs help! I accidentally marked myself covid positive by clicking a tab, it have a warning that did not ask me if I was covid positive but instead asked if I wanted to upload my information. That is really unclear. I could find no way to undo this mistake. Reply to the response from the developer: At the time i reviewed it, the "3 step process" was definitely not a clearly defined clearly labeled 3 step process for marking yourself positive. Hopefully it has changed.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 04:39:13__

Investigate this fraud and the MaskGate fraud as well. When you get your mask in mail from PBC make sure to get a sharpy, write a message on it, and send back!

### Description
> Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. 
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple’s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. 
<br>Care19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. 
<br> 
<br>The downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CombatCOVID MDC app is for Miami-Dade County coverage.
<br>CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Miami-Dade County, Florida, a diverse community of over 2.7 million people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.


### User interface

### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Alabama Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | alabamapublichealth@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [201 Monroe Street Montgomery, Alabama 36104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/201%20Monroe%20Street%20Montgomery,%20Alabama%2036104) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Up front everything is bluetooth, bluetooth, bluetooth. Then after install the app demands location, too. Good privacy policy, but I can't leave both bluetooth and location on at all times or my phone would have to stay on the charger 24/7. Maybe my fault for having an old phone.

> Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American<br> :date: __2020-10-12 15:50:41__

> Works but Annoyed - had this for UAB support, though it kept saying I had been exposed, the problem my phone was charging at the time it said the exposure happened on 2 different days at the same time of day (late Sunday evenings) I didn't go anywhere during those timeframes. It has to be binging off one of my neighbors but I had to quarantine and not attend classes. I've now removed it.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 08:18:57__

### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut, supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CTDPH to know where or who you are for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CDPH.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> COVID Alert NJ App is being made available by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) to complement New Jersey’s comprehensive COVID-19 contact tracing effort. COVID Alert NJ is a free and secure mobile phone app that allows New Jerseyans:
<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 – even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 – especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push “Allow” COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to “Allow” your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also “Allow” your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of New Jersey  Applications |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html](https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html) |
| **Email** | COVIDapp@doh.nj.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+New+Jersey++Applications](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+New+Jersey++Applications) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks.

> I Certainly can't actually Rate something I just got.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:11:50__

> Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 04:34:50__

> This app collects daily data well enough, BUT IT GIVES LITTLE INFO THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE!! PLEASE IMPROVE IT!!! - County-level % is % of STATE!! USELESS!! WHAT'S IMPORTANT is the current 7 day positivity testing rate!!! - NOT BY COUNTY, BUT BY MY CURRENT LOCATION!!! - EVEN BETTER: GIVE THE % POSITIVITY WITHIN A 1,5,10,25 MIKE RADIUS!!! THIS WAY, PEOPLE CAN MANAGE RISK!!! - YOU HAVE THE GPS COORDINATES OF EVERYONE, SO YOU CAN DO THIS!!! WHY DON'T YOU????<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:25:32__

> Just really want to know if the app talks to the NY and PA apps? I deal with people from both daily.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:15:30__

> Even though I have exposure alerts on it seems to only do a scan if I open the app itself. Shouldn't it do this automatically daily?<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:15:12__

> During setup I realized that it requires both GPS and Bluetooth to be engaged. If I do this with my phone, it would die in 4 hours. I'm an emergency service personnel, I can't go with a dead phone all day. Sorry. Good idea but won't work for me.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 23:00:14__

> I have this app in my phone but in order to make it more effective it needs more advertise and insist ppl to download it. It can only work more ppl uses and learn how to use it properly. I also not sure myself when its says it use bluetooth in order to make it work. Does it mean I require to wear actual blutooth on my year? Many ppl didnt even know that NJ has this app. Otherwise its a good idea.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 18:33:37__

> Installing this =捉蟲入屎忽<br> :date: __2020-10-19 04:16:38__

> Easy to install. My only question is how does it know you have been in contact with someone personally? How is connecting the dots, so to speak?<br> :date: __2020-10-12 17:38:42__

> I understand needing location for the alerts but why would it need bluetooth? Modern day dependence on wireless devices destroys battery life as it is. I keep my Bluetooth, location and few other settings off unless I need to use them. Again, I understand location, but why bluetooth. *Anyone that doesn't know keep bluetooth wifi and nfc off unless you need it to keep yourself safe from hackers.<br> :date: __2020-10-12 04:27:49__

> The stupidest app ever. It is relying on the people who use it to be honest and informed. Right! Come on, how likely is that? Verification pin? Your still relying on people to admit they might be sick, get tested and then be honest enough to share that info. Good luck with that. Also.

> Work in an emergency room and downloaded to see how accurate the alerts would be. I assumed I would have to turn off the notification from being alerted to much.

Poor development something like this should be more easily usable.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 11:40:32__

### Description
> This is the official app of New York State, run by the NYS Department of Health as part of New York State’s comprehensive COVID-19 testing and contact tracing effort. The ultimate goal is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by:
<br>1. Alerting you if a sick person spends 10 mins or more within 6 feet of you, because this puts you at a higher risk of SARS CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Simple, Easy, and Fast. The "Covid Alert NY" app is simply fantastic. I've been using the app for over 2 months now and I don't have any complaints with the app. This app will notify me if I come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for Coronavirus. Another great aspect of the app is it gives me up-to-date information on all positve and negtive Covid-19 test in New York State. The app breaks down the data for the whole state and also shows you your Local County data too. 5 Star app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 22:42:53__

> I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:19:31__

> Assume this app works, but haven't had any alerts. Also the symptoms are similar to common cold and allergies so that may cause alarm to people.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 16:15:08__

> It's not detecting my Bluetooth.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 20:43:55__

> Wish this had an "I tested negative" button for people with symptoms that turn out to be unrelated. Also, I suspect this gives a false sense of security--the main threat is people who don't take this seriously. Those people aren't using this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 06:37:55__

> Tells you that you may have covid if you report one symptom. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 05:28:25__

> Not sure it works<br> :date: __2020-11-01 14:37:14__

> Good probably, but SILLY. it asks how you're feeling, and when I checked the box for a runny nose it gave me a "sorry you're not feeling well" page, complete with "could be COVID19" warnings. Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 00:45:24__

> I assume it does what it says it does, but it's also caused panic in a bunch of people I know because for example I put in fatigue this morning and it was like YOU MIGHT HAVE COVID. And that caused a panic attack. I'm going to keep it installed so that I can be notified and stuff, but I talked to my doctor and he agreed that I shouldn't look at it so that I don't have daily panic attacks over what's probably nothing.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 15:02:09__

> Two stars because: It is a shame that only just over 100k people have downloaded this app in a city of 8.4 million and a state of 12 million. Given zero privacy issues detected or reported, this app should be suggested via text messages all the time.

> concept is good. alas even with bluetooth on it didn't work. then again most of the people in my neighborhood refuse to get tested (I get tested) and/or aren't tech savvy so this app isn't useful for my neighborhood<br> :date: __2020-11-07 14:18:38__

> I loved this app, until yesterday when it stopped updating. The person info I have is now for 2 days ago. It's now worthless.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 12:29:55__

> This app in no way lets u know if you have been in contact with covid<br> :date: __2020-10-30 18:24:06__

> IMO, this is something which should be done on a national platform, and incorporated into Google, so all smartphone users have this information. Instead, this app is quite large, not moveable to the SD card, and forces you to use Bluetooth more often than is wise... not only for battery life, but vulnerability issues. Also, the "questionnaire" of daily symptoms blows quite the dog whistle, flipping out over a stuffy nose, practically equating it with a positive COVID diagnosis. Too many bugs to be worked out for my liking... sorry. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:43:45__

> I like the idea of an app like this a lot. It's not that I go out in public often, and being notified of a possible exposure is good. However, on my Pixel 3XL, performance went into the toilet, and the battery drain was insane. Normally, I could listen to YouTube music while working out in my basement and only go down to 85-90% from a full charge. With this installed, it drops to 25-30% in an hour. It also caused recharge times to increase dramatically. Fix that issue, and I will reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 13:24:54__

> I would like to keep this app installed but I think it was causing my phone a lot of issues. My phone kept forgetting bluetooth devices until I uninstalled this.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 14:37:11__

> I'm worried as to its accuracy. I'm still waiting for my COVID-19 results, which I'm expecting since around September 24. I haven't felt sick, but given the high amount of asymptomatic carriers idk how reliable this app would be with so many people out on the streets without any knowledge of being infected due to irresponsible testing measures in the city. And yes, I've tried to call several times. No answer and they keep hanging up the phone.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 20:07:30__

> Update: Dev continues completely tone-deaf, as evidenced by their reply below, which has ZERO to do with my review. Nowhere did I do so much as insinuate that the app was for medical diagnosis. I know exactly what the app is meant to do, & insulting my intelligence is not going to hide the fact that the app is useless & does not do the job. They still haven't fixed anything. Literally thousands of complaints similar to mine & they still don't get it. The entire point is that chronically ill people ALREADY HAVE BASELINE SYMPTOMS, and if those aren't entered into ANY tracing application, the RESULTS WILL BE WRONG. How are you allowed to work on this app or respond to questions without that basic understanding? This is very definition of ableist trash. I stand by my original review: Absolutely worthless garbage. They don't listen & things keep getting worse. Inexcusable incompetence. I dont want your lying responses, I want you to do your job or get out of the way so someone who can has the chance to fix your mess. This is ridiculous. \*\** Original review: How can you possibly do anything like this without first allowing for a person's baseline health? I've got chronic conditions that share C19 symptoms. This app now thinks I've got C19. This is thoughtless, ableist, privileged foolishness. Throwing the chronically ill under the bus, as always. Why do you refuse to learn? Uninstalled. I want to be part of the solution, but your ignorant gatekeeping shuts me out. Nice job.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:58:56__

### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age. Users will be asked to confirm that they are 18 years or older the first time the App is opened.
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train, at a check-out line in a grocery store, or at a restaurant or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded, a public health representative will ask the individual if they are willing to accept a 6-digit validation code. If they agree, a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> This is a great app and i wish i knew about it sooner.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 07:54:14__

> Please download this app to keep every Pennsylvanian safe. It asks once a day if you are having symptoms, and if you test positive you can let the app know. This way anyone whose phone recently came in proximity to yours will get notified. It uses bluetooth, NOT location, and the random ID numbers are anonymous and get purged regularly. It only works well if everyone is on board. It only takes a few small steps to protect our community.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 00:23:05__

> There's a bunch of armchair developers in these reviews. Anyone with any common knowledge can go into the app's info to see that it clearly says "No permissions requested". The only issue with is that it may not protect you because not enough people are running the exposure system. As poorly developed as it is, the app does it's job and has an easy UI.

> Tried this app for less than few weeks or so, often question of how it can actually sense if I have been exposed to someone tested positive covid 19 just by bluetooth and location services ?

### Description
> MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.
<br>Your personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How MD COVID Alert works:
<br>When devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Maryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Maryland Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | MD-Contact-Tracing-Support@maryland.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Answer other's review: cannot turn on this app. Samsung S20, All the Android phone is automatic turn on the COVID notification. Go to setting and go Google set. will see the COVID 19 Notification turn on. Finally the MD launch the COVID 19 app. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 00:18:12__

> Thank you for this app. My grandparents have covid-19. This is very serious. Bluetooth does take up a lot of battery so I basically just turn it on before I leave to go to the store or out and shut it off while I'm safe at home. Please wear your masks and continue to social distance.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 17:36:27__

> Hopefully this app keeps me safe so far what I have read about it seems safe for my phone privacy I'm giving it five stars for now I wonder if it will protect me and notify me in a safe distance from a infected person before they get within 6 feet with me I don't want to be talking to that person we're walking by somebody or around anybody and they are infected what about the people who are infected and don't even know that they are so many questions not enough words hope everybody's safe.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 03:32:27__

> BETTER Than nothing! At least they are trying SOMETHING! Unlike our current "Commander And Tweet"!!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 06:56:32__

> I have android 5 samsung note phone and I could install it. Read the info about the app which explains how it works (without IDg person or phone) and that made it clear that location setting doesnt have to be on. Bluetooth was activated by app; assume i need to have it active when outside the house. Haven't been anywhere yet, so can't really evaluate app properly. But happy to have this app and plenty of free and nearby testing where I live. We can use all the help we can get!<br> :date: __2020-11-11 17:15:01__

> Glad MD was able to get this going. A nationwide alert system would of course be preferable, but the US is obviously not ready for that. Trivial to setup, unobtrusive, and the privacy/security framework seems sound.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:15:46__

> Just downloaded the app so I'm unsure of how great it works just yet, however please change the icon as it triggers my trypophobia!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 13:16:23__

> I don't quite understand how this is keeping me safe. It's relying on the honesty of the population. Those that self report using this app most likely won't be spending much outside their home. They'll be using door dash or have a family member or friend pick up what they need.

> It's certainly valuable to have a way of being notified if I was close to someone for 15 minutes who didn't know my name and who came down with COVID-19. The reason I didn't give the app 5 stars is that it doesn't allow me to check in daily and report suspicious symptoms. The only thing I can report is a test result. The other thing I don't like is that there are separate apps for neighboring states. That means that I have to have multiple contact tracing apps on my phone.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 16:38:08__

> Had to find a link from an article because it never showed up in the play store. Otherwise, I assume it's built on the same framework/template as many other states' apps and it remains to be seen how effective it is.If it really requires you to volunteer a positive test result, I'm not sure how they can expect much participation (or prevent trolling).Considering how little messaging I've seen and how resistant people are to even the most basic prevention, it seems like it may be a token gesture.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 02:18:22__

### Description
> DC CAN is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for DC Department of Health (DoH). The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DoH.
<br>Your personal use of DC CAN will help anonymously alert DC citizens who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable DC CAN, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>How DC CAN Works:
<br>When devices with DC CAN are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the DC CAN app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How DC CAN Protects Your Privacy:
<br>DC DoH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. DoH does not want or need to know where or who you are for DC CAN to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to DC DoH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, DoH will verify positive tests and then provide DC CAN users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. DoH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed Washington's DC CAN app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing DC CAN! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep DC moving forward!

> Install was easy, and the app just sits on my phone and I forget it's even on here. Hopefully more people start using it, as it doesn't seem to be intrusive or even a battery drain at all (at least on my phone) you will need to have Bluetooth turned on in order for this app to work, but it uses something called low energy Bluetooth, which is probably why it doesn't affect battery life.

> App installed fine. I disabled notifications in Virginia app first, installed DC app, but when I go back to VA app it says I can only have notifications turned on for one at a time. ... Knowing the two don't talk to each other, this situation is absolutely bonkers.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 06:57:32__

> In order to get this app to download, I had to uninstall VA's COVIDWISE app and re-install after the DC CAN app was installed (and then re-enable notifications for both apps once they were both installed). I'm sure this has something to do with androids security permission structure - but it was a little confusing (and I wouldn't have known to do it without reading another user's playstore review).<br> :date: __2020-10-20 18:40:04__

> don't know if it works yet, but Install problem. You need to DISABLE COVID notifications prior to install or it will not allow you to download through play store. This could occur if (like me) you have previously installed another state's COVID app and have enabled COVID notifications. Once installed you can re-enable COVID exposure notifications.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 06:51:41__

### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

> The app is a great concept and was checking when initially installed. On my Samsung S6, it was a power drain. Also, it hasn't checked for exposures since 10/23/20. Today is 11/20/20 so its been almost a month. As COVID case rates are accelerating again, it seems this app would be more pertinent than ever. I'm looking forward to any suggestions that may be offered to resolve these two issues.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 10:47:56__

> Stopped updating 3 weeks ago. I checked the settings. It said all was good but app would not update. Prior to last update it did so at least once a day. So I wonder how accurate it is???<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:30:16__

> I downloaded this app when it first came out. It checked often for exposure. Today, October 26, it says that the last time it checked was October 13. Almost 2 weeks ago! What's up??? Bluetooth is enabled.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:09:52__

> I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 22:36:25__

> I have been so fortunate so far to have been able to help families and my family, by running errands. I wear my masks I wash my hands. I use bottles of sanitizer even if they the store just did. Why? The lack of seeing how much folks dont know PPE training by hospital staff, how folks will grabs carts(walk pass wipes stands) and proceed to then grab spray bottles to spray the carts. And then use paper towels to wipe them down? Now, quiz time what was wrong? 😳<br> :date: __2020-10-21 18:10:18__

> App is completely based on a user uploading their data to contact others. I'm in a county where people can't spell app, let alone upload any data to help others.

> Such a small percentage of people are downloading this for Android (can't speak for iOS), and such a small percentage of people are actually tested daily in this state.

> Great idea, problematic execution. Gives a false sense of security. With so few people in this state getting tested, so few wearing masks, it's unlikely that most of your covid exposure will be captured & recorded by this app. And you must leave Bluetooth on for it to work? I understand why, but it's a battery drain, & constant EMF radiation exposure is an unwelcome side effect.

Now my car Bluetooth, 3 different air pods and 2 earpieces will not connect at all but I was told they'd work in conjunction. That's not true for "MY" phone operating system. Thought it was the perfect app but now I have doubts because 2 Bluetooth apps CANNOT be used at same time, so please don't tell downloaders or be sure to share correct information.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 21:36:12__

### Description
> Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service available on both iPhone and Android phones that helps slow the spread of COVID-19. If you have enabled Exposure Notifications on your phone, whenever you are within close proximity (approximately 6 feet of someone for at least 10 minutes), your phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can share these anonymous tokens, which will send a notification to anyone with whom you have exchanged tokens with recently, notifying them of possible exposure. The service is available nationwide, but will be customized for Colorado. This service does not collect any personally identifying information or share it with the State of Colorado, your Local Public Health Agency, Apple, or Google.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications](https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications) |
| **Email** | CO_Exposure_Notifications@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 


## Mentioned servers

> Very useful app for telling me if there are covid positive reports.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 18:06:19__

> This is an excellent tool. I think they could do a better job informing people on how they get the code to start the notification part though. For those interested, the health department can generate the code for you when you receive a call from a contact tracer. You cannot just trigger it based on a positive test result. Please answer the phone when they call after you have been tested or call them back.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:28:48__

> It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:19:46__

> Called county health department to ask about notification & special code issue. RESULTS: 1) testing agency reports positive tests to the State 2) State notifies counties in which the positive people live 3) w/in 24 hrs, counties notify people who tested positive 4)w/in 48 hrs (cases are mounting),Contact Tracers call infected people & ask w/whom they have been in contact. NO REASON for infected people to need code. Call Labor Dept if there's a work issue. RECOMMEND: call people who know things.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:45:59__

> I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 03:31:37__

> Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:54:36__

> Positive test here but can't share my result because I don't have a verification code. failed app so far🤷‍♂️ I've searched for about 15min and can only figure it's because my test was conducted out of state. However, I was around people in CO and would like to share it. Will people share if it's not easily available? I would also recommend information about privacy and how your results a reported. People might have a sense of shame or guilt but might share if there's some sense of anonymity.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 01:48:11__

> Won't let me allow to send notifications<br> :date: __2020-11-06 19:43:06__

> Good call, Colorado but an issue with the app is that there is no verification code sent when trying to enter test results. I suggest you make this process a little more clear, and provide an FAQ if anyone else has run into this as well.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 03:50:37__

> Love the concept. Not a fan that it requires bluetooth to turn on notifications. That's a battery drain.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 15:52:09__

> major power consumption issues. had to uninstall it because I couldn't use my phone normally without having to charge in the middle of the day, and I only really text on an average day. also noticed my phone was running very hot constantly when I had the app installed. this is something we definitely need, but please optimize it so it doesn't make my phone unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:11:35__

> There is nothing wrong with the app persay, its just i have been using it and i have been doing alot of christmas shopping, and i got not 1 alert. You know how many people out there that have tested positive and havent reported!! So this app isnt going to work!<br> :date: __2020-11-09 17:38:51__

> When I try to turn on notifications, I get an error saying "something went wrong". It will not enable.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 21:26:50__

> Seems like this could be a really good app. BUT.....where does someone get the verification code needed to enter a covid 19 result?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 16:27:15__

> Maybe I'm not understanding something but when I try to share my results, It says it will send me a one time verification code, but nothing happens.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 18:31:26__

> Needs gps and bluetooth to be active. Drains battery. Why do we need gps active.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 17:51:00__

> The app itself is fine, but installing it caused my other apps trying to update to do so slowly. So slowly, that on a fast wifi connection it would take more than 30 minutes for just one to do so. I uninstalled this one and might try again later. Once this was uninstalled, the normal updates had no problem<br> :date: __2020-10-30 04:00:56__

> While your installing this IT DOSE ASK FOR YOUR LOCATION ! I haven't gotten to use this app yet I'm just now installing it so unlike other comments who claim THEY DO NOT ask for a location I paid attention and yes it dose .<br> :date: __2020-10-27 04:59:24__

> There is also no indicator that the app is doing anything. Show me some stats of how many people it thinks I've had "close contact" with. Show me some stats of how many app users have reported positive results. Etc... Right now it's just a black box I'm somehow supposed to just trust that it's working.

> Greatly flawed. I can't post results because lack of verification code. No way to find or figure this out either.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 23:19:00__

> Downloaded this twice. Immediately annoying notifications that it will not work without an update. Takes you to Google Play to update and crashes.

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It helps me feel connected but I'm not sure how<br> :date: __2020-11-22 13:43:07__

> Easy and quick to use. Now mostly warns if there is no connection. However if connection is later lost whilst reporting symptoms, this is not reported. \*\*\*\* Version number shown on menu screen is stuck at 1.0.0, actual version is now 2.0.1 \*\*\*\*<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:56:13__

> This app has worked well and I have reported most days for several months without a problem. But in the last week, there have been problems logging in, being asked for a password when it already should have it. Then the last few days, the page has loaded to report and then gone blank before I am able to click the report button. I have uninstalled and reloaded the page several times and finally, was able to log in. Will persevere because I trust this app and believe it is worthwhile.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:44:20__

> Generally good and important info collector - however daily reminder to do is not reliable and for some reason had to log in again recently despite using it nearly every day.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:13:24__

> When trying to find the outbreak numbers in my area I find the maps are inadequate, very few names of boroughs, and illegible but can't zoom in sufficiently.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 00:34:22__

> Doesn't always record my daily visit, then needed logging in again.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 22:15:01__

> I think you should be asking about daily interactions and mask wearing, visits to places and relatively risky behaviors. I think you should be including political affiliation and source of respondents news about covid. Perhaps you should ask about their religion and whether they gather in church groups, whether they abide by local quarantine restrictions.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 19:26:32__

> Following a recent app update the push notifications have stopped so I have to remember to update daily<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:36:28__

> Latest version doesn't prompt me for daily report.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:41:08__

> There is no facility to show that I had an antibody test not an antigen test which was positive. So now your data looks like I had covid twice. I had it in march with no test. I had positive antibody test in June and a positive antibody test eight months after the illness in November. Your results will be skewed of the data of antibodies and antigen tests is put in the same question<br> :date: __2020-11-21 11:48:54__

> I fill in the questionnaire every morning, the icon shows that I've done it today, yet later I get a notification and when I check in the app it says I haven't done it, so I do it again. This happens every single day. Apart from today, when it said i hadn't contributed for six days. Which is not true.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 00:29:29__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well! Allows me to view my workplace Covid-19 test results in this app!<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:11:00__

> It is a good app, easy to use. My only complaint is that after I fill out my school's passport, it still notifies me to complete a healthy together survey every day. I wish the passport counted for both.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 15:40:38__

> I think this is a great idea. Hopefully people will continue to download it. I do wish it was easier to figure out how to schedule tests.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 19:14:09__

> Doesn't drain battery badly. I think the question "Have you been tested for Covid19?", should say "Have you been tested for covud 19 in the last 20 days?" Notification for test results come back quicker than my doctor can contact me.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 16:00:57__

> Great app and I have invited everyone in my contacts due to the high necessity to know how healthy the people you surround yourself with. The even better part about this app is the fact that if you allow it to trace you (and you should), it can tell you about other users being sick or testing positive if you've been around them and you don't even have to know the person! I would, however, like it a lot more (or give it 5 stars), if it would update the map of testing areas. A lot missing.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 23:00:50__

> It seems to work really well now.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 19:24:06__

> This is a simple and clear platform for users to check and stay safe during covid. DEVS: Are there Plans to expand this to other states, since most don't yet have a contact tracing app? - from NJ over here, but really like the ease of use the interface is. Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-19 20:16:13__

> Could use some work on user interface and ability to add specific dates of positive testing and symptoms instead just on general day. Also, does this work with Google Covid-19 Exposure notifications or just by itself?<br> :date: __2020-06-07 20:53:40__

> App has been working fine & I like that it gives me the locations of free testing but other than that I don't have a use for it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 20:05:35__

> Went really well<br> :date: __2020-05-11 00:10:06__

> Why isn't this app integrated with Google and Apple's covid exposure notification system? Please add support for that.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:53:41__

> Wish the app would send notices for the number of cases in the county at a scheduled time not just a map.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 22:07:45__

> You need to add an option to state nothing has changed since last assessment so you can quickly provide answers. You could even have it show up in the notification as a response. It would really make it much better.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 18:38:18__

> Too wordy for daily use...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 06:38:47__

> Couldnt find the testing place and how to get tested<br> :date: __2020-05-11 23:48:56__

> I think the app should alert you via text message when you come within 6-12 feet of someone who has been exposed and/ or tested.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 03:20:09__

> Pretty useless. Tells me to quarantine just because I live with someone who's tested positive regardless of how long ago that was.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 09:35:27__

> This app tells you to get tested for COVID if you have one symptom. Sometimes people have body aches because they did a hard work out. Sometimes people get a sore throat because they are too much sugar. There are other reasons to have some of these symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 22:17:10__

> Does not show the areas of covid on map. Shows absolutely nothing on the map.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 18:37:29__

> I suppose i don't hate it for its functionality. But i do hate how I'm forced to use it, and every time I work out it says i need to get tested because I'm sore and I have to show these results to employers/professors.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 17:56:32__

> Digital contact tracing turned off? This is the apps main feature. I can find mom way to turn it back on. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-08-29 15:34:43__

> The app has killed my battery. It seems like it could be useful, but an app on a dead phone can only do so much.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 23:11:19__

> It's Draining my battery at 45% usage over my other apps and I only use it briefly for one moment of the day. Plus the state of utah isn't using the tracking feature. Please update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 14:47:28__

> This was quickly rolled out, however no serious advertising whatsoever after, therefore no real impact with only a limited user base. Coronavirus is still spreading and could have been mitigated by better contact tracing and aggressive testing.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 19:57:36__

> It needs more white space and adds too many ads. It blocks my work at most inconvenient times with full screen. I removed it and had to add it back to see covid test from hospital. Also no place to record antibody test.<br> :date: __2020-07-18 14:21:26__

> Sucked. No real online presence, forced to use phone/tablet, prone to timeouts using without high speed wifi connection resulting in permanent lockout with only a reference to a large medical organization that one evidently has to waste time finding it out.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. 
<br>Designed by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. 
<br>In these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>Note that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.
<br>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>This app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
<br>This temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. 
<br>For more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

When I chose the email option I did not receive the email. I then went on line to for help and dialed the number given online and it was the hospital main number.

### Description
> PathCheck (formerly COVID Safe Paths) can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available. 
<br>Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>We are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.
<br>The PathCheck program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck Foundation, established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the PathCheck app and associated tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities. 
<br>The goal of PathCheck is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this"resource" multiple times.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | WebMD, LLC |
| **Website**  | [http://www.webmd.com](http://www.webmd.com) |
| **Email** | android@webmd.net |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 15:57:52__

> I have found that searching for certain terms, such as "dementia", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:13:12__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A ways to go but a great start. The login process could be smoother, takes a bit to get in so log in before you need it. The image is a bit stretched in the app vs your id card. Lastly, I wish they did more education to businesses so they understand this is a legal version of identification.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 05:06:04__

> *update* changed review from 1 to 4 stars. After failed attempts to load, contacted support team and it loaded perfectly. Not convenient that, but yes loaded. Has worked great since. Used ID to get fishing license no prob. Used for other times no prob In state. Not used a lot, but nice when I have.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 15:59:26__

Creating digital ID was then easy. Can't create account. Put in info and after a while a blank box comes up with a green OK. Everything is extremely slow!

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> Only after 10 attempts (using my new DL that just arrived in the mail earlier that day) was it able to register my driver's liscence in the virtual wallet. Other than taking forever to scan my documents, the app is pretty darn good.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 04:06:34__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Everything I upload the front side of my ID it kicks me out and makes me login in again??<br> :date: __2020-09-08 00:43:05__

> Frustrating. Trying to help roommate update his state id. Got to taking pics of id but then it would ask to log in after taking pic of back id. Multiple times. Hes mentally disabled and gets so frustrated that he almost punched a hole through a door window... he has little patience and gets so frustrated easily with almost anything.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 16:55:34__

> Need more documents<br> :date: __2020-05-26 17:43:27__

> 5/17/2020 I came back to the app to see if any functional utility was turned on. Instead all it does is open the website for each issue. I thought this app would provide a list of my vehicles and what the registration status is. How about selecting a vehicle to order a copy of title? I uploaded my license as proof of identity, why?<br> :date: __2020-05-18 00:48:27__

> I'm STILL not sure what the actual use of this is. when i added my ID it said it's not a replacement for the physical ID. also it's been easier to just pull out my ID than login again. at least the one time i was gonna use it i just gave up because i didn't have time to go through the verification process every time.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 23:55:02__

> Sweet, I need a registration renewal and everything is closed. So I see on Nextdoor about this app. But I can't use it - why? I have a 2 yr old $150 Lenovo Phab which won't allow this app. So I need to buy a new phone to use - great. Not everyone can afford a new phone every year especially Seniors. The emissions places are closed as are the DL locations so I guess I just drive with an expired tag.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 20:23:52__

> I dont like the registration processes seems like a traker, n I dont trust it.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 03:11:37__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I had sprained my ankle really bad and I didn't think I needed to go to a hospital and risk getting Covid. The doctor was great very informative and answered all my questions. The downside is the app has a section for emailing your doctor and the one I selected did not receive them. That information should of been on the description of the doctor. I also needed a doctors note she said she'd get it but forgot. Contacted support multiple times till after almost 2 days I got my doctors note.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 00:53:59__

> I have been having a great experience with both the app and Amwell services. It has been a god-send for me for many reasons. I am very grateful my insurance has teamed up with Amwell. However, as time went on I discovered the billing dept really sucks! I had appts scheduled and when I logged in I found that I suddenly had to pay for the visit out of my pocket, but my insurance covers it 100%. I was expected to pay for it and be reimbursed by my insurance. Like I have $80 just sitting around.<br> :date: __2019-11-13 14:10:22__

> Need to use it more. It's a good starting point.<br> :date: __2019-10-25 18:44:01__

> Disappointed off the bat. was sent an email from uhc to click and register to get an amazon gift card for registering. nada. its a good idea for doctors... help people out by making it cheaper and more accessible during the times of day when people actually get sick. so 3 stars.<br> :date: __2019-05-25 22:29:37__

When I got to the front of that person's queue, after 15 minutes the app forcefully logged me out! I feel terrible and this was 4.5 hours of my time wasted! Not cool!

> First visit for my son went great. Doctor was friendly and listened and helpful. Second visit was for me. The doctor couldn't even work his camera correctly so all you could see was the top of his head. He then was very condescending. He didn't even know about one of the medications I was taking (it's used off label for my treatment).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Tech said the app should "just work" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone.

> I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:06:13__

### Description
> Take 30 seconds every day to fight COVID-19. Your daily health check-ins help doctors and scientists anticipate the next outbreak and get ahead of the coronavirus. The first time you download the app and share how you feel, we’ll donate a meal to people in need through Feeding America.
<br>The How We Feel app only asks you to self-report age, gender, postal code and any health symptoms you’re experiencing. It does not ask you to sign in with your name, phone number or email address. The data is securely shared with select scientists, doctors and public health professionals who are actively working to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>The How We Feel app was built by an independent, nonprofit organization called The How We Feel Project. Our organization was founded by a volunteer team of scientists, public health researchers and technologists. Our mission is to make the world healthier by connecting citizens with the global health and research community. The organization was created in March, 2020 to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>We are proud to be working with scientists, doctors and public health professionals from leading institutions including McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
<br>We are collaborating with Dr. Gary King from Harvard University’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science’s Privacy Insights Project. Dr. King specializes in developing technologies to make data available to researchers while protecting participants’ individual identities.
<br>Our technology team includes Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest and a volunteer group of current and former Pinterest employees.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | The How We Feel Project, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.howwefeel.org](https://www.howwefeel.org) |
| **Email** | info@howwefeel.org |
| **Physical address**  | [949 Bridge Rd San Leandro, CA 94577](https://www.google.com/maps/search/949%20Bridge%20Rd%20San%20Leandro,%20CA%2094577) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>Monthly membership (when you’re not using insurance). $45 for the first visit, then after you will have access to 24/7 virtual doctor visits for just $10 per month.
<br>Pay-per-visit (when you’re using insurance). Costs vary based on insurance copay and deductible. Many plans cover 100%!
<br>Unlike other on-demand providers, HealthTap connects you with a doctor via text or video in less than one minute--not hours or even the next day. We also don’t require you to answer a bunch of questions in advance. You can see a doctor immediately.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>Note that certain medications including controlled substances must be prescribed by a specialist or with an in-person visit, and cannot be ordered by HealthTap doctors or any other on-demand provider.
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.

<br>HealthTap does not guarantee patients will receive a prescription, does not prescribe DEA controlled substances and may not prescribe non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | HealthTap |
| **Website**  | [https://www.healthtap.com/](https://www.healthtap.com/) |
| **Email** | support@healthtap.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Loved very quick easy and affordable as i do not have insurance and i also work crazy hours so this was nice<br> :date: __2020-11-20 18:28:48__

> Excellent service and was completed in 15 minutes. Awesome app and great price too!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 16:36:00__

> Very straight forward easy to use 10 bucks for a dr. This is great<br> :date: __2020-11-20 06:33:47__

> Great service and it was free<br> :date: __2020-11-19 02:56:46__

> All the big named hospitals, down to the smaller local clinics and emergency room clinincs almost refused to assist me in aquiring needed medication. When (or before, my suggestion) the standard doesn't work, please give these guys a shot. True testimony.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 22:21:41__

> I've used the app twice. Once for myself and once for my teenaged son. Both times I was connected with a Dr. quickly - within 2 minutes. They listened to my symptoms, gave me some treatment advice and put in a Rx as needed to my local pharmacy. The whole process took maybe 10-15 minutes. The service is wonderful for someone like me - a working mom who often can't get a Drs appt for weeks and doesn't want to visit the ER for a non emergency, esp.during covid. And as a bonus the price is great.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 06:00:58__

> I love this. The doctor I spoke to was really nice and it saves on the trouble of Dr office visits. Especially helpful now.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 15:46:37__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2020-11-15 09:38:20__

> So much faster, easier and cheaper than an ER visit. I've used the service twice so far, and the doctors are very good. I highly recommend this for anyone who does not have insurance or wants to avoid physical ER visits.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:13:29__

> I love it and it cheaper than insurance<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:37:10__

> So far so good. Haven't done much in it. Will reevaluate<br> :date: __2020-07-24 00:16:01__

> Helpful. But hope there is a suggestion for home remedy temporary treatment before suggesting to seek immediate help<br> :date: __2020-06-09 04:00:32__

> I dont know just downloded the app today<br> :date: __2020-05-24 23:33:54__

> So far so good. App is easy to fill out. After my appointment with the doctor I'll come back with a final decision and change my star rating according to that experience.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 16:10:00__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-03-13 08:34:50__

> Good!<br> :date: __2019-10-18 13:23:30__

> Is a great service with great providers. one downside though is that I couldn't get an answer from my Doctor due to the app being buggy.<br> :date: __2019-04-20 03:40:59__

> Symptom checker need further enhancement<br> :date: __2018-10-14 16:27:26__

> Full of bugs in new version, I can't open my notifications, I can't see my questions. Another thing is that you ask a simple yes or no question but the doctors answer something else.<br> :date: __2018-09-07 23:00:52__

> As much as I like this service since it keeps me from needing to go to a 
doctor's office, it needs work. I have done two consults now as a Prime 
member. My prescriptions were not actually called in on either one, 
resulting in extra time and visits needed at my pharmacies.<br> :date: __2018-08-03 15:34:35__

> I used once without an issue. Now I've paid for another consult but had no 
response from the physician and I keep getting a pop up about verifying my 
email but the link is never sent (I've checked all folders). So now I'm 
just out $50??<br> :date: __2018-07-29 04:51:44__

> I don't care for the app too much<br> :date: __2018-02-25 19:30:18__

> The actual appointments are costly and I was not able to see a doctor from Colorado via video chat for diagnosis<br> :date: __2018-02-05 06:26:10__

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:05:40__

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable. Just be aware that the free service could have you waiting quite a while for any responses. You might be better off with other services.<br> :date: __2019-10-03 13:28:51__

> stomach pain<br> :date: __2019-01-17 00:45:53__

> Was using the service for over a year and consulting with Dr Leslie Hart. 
They changed the service now I cant find her, get my meds anymore and have 
been going through hell. Thanks HealthTap for changing services on people 
who now can't get their meds.<br> :date: __2018-08-10 19:23:24__

> I'm not going to be paying for this after my trial ends, as it shuts down every time a consult begins. Doesn't let me do a thing. I already paid 19.99 and I'm asking for a refund.<br> :date: __2018-01-06 19:21:22__

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

> Wouldn't let me add or update. I kept trying but it would not work.  Plus it kept asking me to upgrade to add money.<br> :date: __2016-03-23 15:29:33__

> I've asked questions twice now without an answer. I guess now you have to pay if you want your question answered. As recent as last fall I had my questions answered within 24 hours. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2016-03-12 21:59:11__

> It keeps saying cannot play video cant use the app. It always says cannot play video -.-<br> :date: __2016-02-11 14:06:09__

> Its false advertising ! All I asked for was a note to get a memory foam mattress topper in a sober living home, just a note he couldn't even do that. Ser vice is a rip off for real..<br> :date: __2020-09-27 07:50:53__

> Horrible registration process. It asks for location. I allow the location and it detects im not in US but registration requires my address and the phone which will be used for collecting the prescription and select the pharmacy in US when obviously i will not be able to go there! And you cant register without doing these steps! And in their website says for non US residents you can still use to get the diagnostic etc. Meh, another useless app in the store<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:42:28__

> The app rules is unclear, it's so disappointing<br> :date: __2020-09-20 00:04:59__

> UNEXCUSABLE. Go to purchase $10 subscription for Virtual Dr and upon entering all my payment Info, it tells me the payment didn't work so I went back and did it again. Same outcome. I went to PayPal to check the history be and turns out I was charged $1 authorization charge BOTH times. No refund, no Customer service help, NOTHING. Sends NOT one payment verification info but would have kept charging $1 each time trying to update payment. HEALTH TAP SHOULD BE ASHAMED<br> :date: __2020-08-24 12:53:33__

> Very Unhelpful I would like my money back<br> :date: __2020-08-22 06:07:56__

> Easily the worst app I've ever used. I got disconnected 10 times when the app crashed during a consultation. I asked for a doctor's note twice from two different doctor's and never got one. The wait times are ridiculous, "5 minute waits times" are more like 30.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 17:59:03__

> Most doctors aren't accessible. But with this app I was able to get 24/7 access. And get the care I needed. Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing experience with the medical director. The lack of empathy towards the urgency of the treatment I needed was very alarming. The misdiagnoses of doctors. I don't even have seborrheic dermatitis apparently! Timed? Ratings? The constan threat of having my account disabled. He suggested seeing local providers instead. So I suggest downloading K Health.<br> :date: __2020-08-14 17:39:37__

> Very easy to use. I had called the Hospital and with COVID-19 I did not have to leave my house. I will use this again. It beats waiting at urgent care, having to drive in, and they send meds if needed. Ea as y to upload pictures and the Dr. can view with your phone camera to examine the area.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 08:15:24__

> Incredibly convenient. It just saved me an hour drive and untold time sitting in urgent care just to have a care provider take a peek at me. I'm a believer after just one e-visit. If it's something that a high resolution photo and a brief description of symptoms could handle this is the ticket. Doctor was very through and set appropriate expectations. Also you get to pick from a list of available doctors and you are able to review their basic credentials on there biography page. Mind blown...<br> :date: __2020-01-21 23:46:25__

I picked the video option) they send explained emails and texts that I ensured to have set up the night before, made sure to sign in at least 30 mins early and it went perfectly awesome.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 00:08:31__

> Love this app. Especially since we are in the middle of covid-19 gives me a piece of mind that I can do appointments from home with both my boys especial since my 4 year old has a trachea gtube and breathing machines and my oldest has special needs and both won't wear a mask. :)<br> :date: __2020-09-18 22:31:35__

> As expected, no problems. Very convenient to see the Dr without having to go into the office. I don't see how to schedule appointments, though; that would be an excellent feature to add.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 22:17:30__

> When in call the sound plays on earpiece not on speaker. The menu option for speaker have no effect and its very difficult to hear such a low voice while having video conference. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 06:53:34__

> Crappy App<br> :date: __2020-09-28 19:08:53__

> It isn't very consistent. Constantly goes in and out. Very irritating when you are trying to talk and listen to your child's doctor and its all messed up.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 20:18:13__

> Functional but not nearly as good of video image and sound connection as a simple Zoom, Google Plus, or WhatsApp. Better than nothing. We were required to use this by our healthcare provider, and it really compromise the ability to communicate during a very important visit.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 16:24:34__

> They used to be good but now they are absolutely a waste of time, all they do now is tell you to visit their office to have the child seen. Hello!! We don't feel safe taking our kids into an urgent care right now. What's the point of this app if you no longer do anything.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 00:36:36__

> Lagging. Voice going in and out. Not able to hear what the other person saying. Screen freezing.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:07:11__

> After waiting almost 45 minutes, the app kicked me out of the waiting, and I had to request a new visit because the Doctor I chose was unavailable. I waited almost two hours, when there were only 2 patients ahead of me. I ended up cancelling the visit because I got tired of waiting online. Not worth it!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 04:13:51__

> Worst Experience Ever! Only once the app has worked for us, rest multiple times it just fails. It says "connecting doctors video" but than fails and says your appointment is canceled. One day we were on hold for 4.5 hours, first it failed call the customer service they reset the appointment, than we waited and the doctor transferred to another doctor and post that failed again. Our friends us CHOP and have never faced such issues.Not sure if its the app or Nemours practices. Will not recommend<br> :date: __2020-07-25 16:52:37__

> Pediatric? Only adult options were listed<br> :date: __2020-07-19 01:15:40__

> Very frusterating. Stayed on the phone for hour just to have the Dr hang up on me due to no connection and i would have full barns on WIFI sitting right next to the box. For days i have been trying to get this to work. And everytime i call the office they just direct me back to this app. On the me help u and it never works. Cant even get my kid seen. Very pissed off mom<br> :date: __2020-07-17 22:37:56__

> The Clermont location is terrible. The staff is incompetent and rude. They do not care about the babies and only want to push products on you without listening to your concerns or needs. Do not go to Nemours in Clermont FL!!! You will be very unhappy!!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 22:39:04__

> My toddler fell outside and cut open his eyebrow. I did not want to go to the urgent care or ER and expose us to c- virus, so I tried the care connect app for urgent care. We were 11th in line waiting. After over an hour and a half of waiting we were still 3rd in line so I left the app running and pulled up my camera to get a new photo of the injury. I switched back over to the app, to see the doctor had declined seeing us. It would've been nice if the app had some type of way to alert you.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 00:06:50__

> Would give zero stars if I could. It says online that they treat ear infections, so I booked an appointment. She has an ear pain and a fever. They said she doesnt have an ear infection and even if she did they wouldn't treat her. That means I just wasted $60. Don't waste your time. Go to a real doctor. I know my doctor would've treated her infection because she's my 4th child and I've been through this many times. I'm so upset! This is what I get for trying to take shortcuts!<br> :date: __2020-03-26 23:36:46__

> Absolutely useless waited 1hr for the doctor to log off and the system to kick me out and make me start all over.........I could wait till morning and see my primary faster<br> :date: __2020-03-25 03:04:17__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HEALTH PLAN OF NEVADA, INC. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider! PLUS I don't get money back even though the N C Doc's turn me away within 60 sec of logging on. There is no one monitoring this so no way to complain or request a refund. This is a Waste Of Time and Money!<br> :date: __2019-11-11 02:33:43__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> life saver<br> :date: __2020-10-26 10:37:41__

> I had my first visit on May 10 2020. The doctor was fabulous. I just needed an asthma inhaler refill. Walgreens pharmacy said the script didn't list generic as acceptable. Put shortly, it was resolved. However, the inhalers were recalled a few months later. I came back to Express Care to explain I needed a new script. Others need returned. Again, doc was great. What upsets me is getting charged $55. I paid for 2 visits & 4 inhalers unnecessarily. Disappointed<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:10:48__

I ended up just doing the appointment over a phone call, much simpler and more reliable that way.  It's also annoying that it makes you fill out payment info and other forms right when you're supposed to have your appointment, instead of letting you do that in advance.<br> :date: __2017-09-02 05:19:50__

I recommend it any time it comes up in conversation.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 00:47:15__

> My Mom passed away in July.. my grief was too, too heavy to carry.. I knew I required/needed help from a Counselor.. Not just any Counselor, but one specializing in grief experienced by those suffering the loss of a loved one. The Doctor I have my Online Visits with has more than met my expectations of helping me through the worst kind of pain,.. pain I never knew that could be as bad as it was and still is at times. I'm healing.. thank you God.. and thank you Doctor.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 21:18:27__

> Internet connection is the key. I had a counselor before and she uses this platform so I don't have much experience with picking providers. But the video quality, sound, and virtual waiting room were all up to par.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:02:37__

> I have used MD live a few times. I am now having trouble with the app itself. I keep getting unable to load needed service. And application exits.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 16:06:56__

> Didn't get to video chat w/the Dr.& had roughly a 3 minute conversation with the Dr.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 00:23:40__

> The scheduling and appointment help has been awesome. The major issue I have is that the sound when on the appointments will not go through my Bluetooth headphones. This is the only app that the calls won't go through. Edit: Appreciate passing it along. I isolated the issue; when the app is running,even in the background, no sound from any app will play to any Bluetooth device. Once the app is closed, the Bluetooth audio in other apps works as expected. Please contact me for more specific info<br> :date: __2020-08-21 17:38:12__

> Operates as intended, but doesn't remember specific patient on a specific device, so it would be better to automatically log in as me on my device, and not my partner/the "who needs care" selection screen. Perhaps even separate passwords for family members in case of sensitive topics?<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:24:47__

> There should be a way to rate an leave reviews for providers<br> :date: __2020-07-24 22:00:17__

> It seem that you have to be online to use it. Can't just use the phone connection. But it works and so I give it a 3<br> :date: __2020-07-10 15:01:21__

> The experience with the doctor was great but the app seems to still have some bugs to work out. Slow response, not accepting my answers, asking too many questions up front, confusing procrss to finally get to a doctor.<br> :date: __2020-06-28 07:52:50__

> I joined my appointment early and began a discussion with the physician, who seemed great. Then while the physician was speaking, the video conference dropped unexpectedly. I searched for how I might reconnect but found nothing and there was no mention of my appt in the history. A moment later, I received a call with an option to setup a new appt. Tried that but this time it didn't connect me to appt at all. These appointments work fast better on a laptop/browser.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 16:29:36__

> Mediocre for video; awful for scheduling. You can tell it any date you want to schedule a doctor and it will show you all doctors whether they are available or not.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 22:04:50__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> Auto created account through cigna, username looks like a name and UUID, but login of app doesn't allow more than 30 chars and doesn't accept email (site does). Unable to login via app, so kinda useless there.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 21:11:42__

> I have tried to use this app to separate times to speak with a doctor using a video call and the first time it would not take my credit card information and I never could get that to complete and now this second time I could never get past the screen asking for my blood pressure my heart rate my blood glucose levels and that sort of thing I can get to that point and it would never go any further no matter what I did so I just closed the app logged into the website through Google and everything w<br> :date: __2020-07-23 17:07:26__

> The app is ok. There were always some issues with the the video chat and scheduling. The dr I spoke to basically had no idea what I was talking about. He just got paid for telling me to go to urgent care. Which I finally got a hold of my PCP and she figured it out. There are not enough providers for other services.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 22:23:55__

No checkup, physical, bloodwork, vitals. The idiocy of people just amazes me. Please do not reproduce. Benifits of app? None. Everyones nice and helpful when you pay them. Unless i have to wait untill the second coming, or its and emergency ( which u should go to e.r) whats the difference from this and a local doc. 10 min drive.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:24:02__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Bronson Healthcare Group |
| **Website**  | [http://Bronsonhealth.com](http://Bronsonhealth.com) |
| **Email** | bronsonhealthcaregroup@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [601 John St. Box H Kalamazoo, MI 49007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/601%20John%20St.%20Box%20H%20Kalamazoo,%20MI%2049007) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bronson+Healthcare+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bronson+Healthcare+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br>Depending on your plan, you can see a telehealth practitioner for medical, therapy or psychiatry services.
<br>Medical services
<br>Online doctors are available 24/7 for minor symptoms like sore throats and stuffy noses.

<br>All of our telemedicine doctors are U.S. board certified.
<br>Therapy services
<br>See a doctoral-level psychologist or a master’s-level therapist by appointment.
<br>Therapists include clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and professional counselors.
<br>All are trained in prevention and treatment techniques specific to telemedicine.
<br>Psychiatry services
<br>Our psychiatrists are online doctors who are also U.S. board certified.
<br>They’re available by appointment and are capable of treating a variety of behavioral health conditions.
<br>They can prescribe medications and work with you to manage them, too, if you need it.
<br>For members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network, the convenience of online health care is at your fingertips.
<br>Please note that telehealth is not for emergencies. If you’re having a medical emergency, call 911.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bcbsm.com](http://www.bcbsm.com) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting.

### Description
> Looking for a faster, easier way to see a doctor? With video visits, you can see a provider anytime from your smartphone, tablet or computer. It is easy to use, private, and secure.

<br>What are the benefits of video visits?
<br>Patients enjoy the hassle-free experience of online visits, including:
<br>· Affordable, easy, and convenient
<br>· Your choice of U.S. board-certified doctors
<br>· No appointment, no waiting
<br>· 24/7/365 mobile or web access
<br>· Consults and diagnoses, prescriptions as appropriate
<br> 
<br>What can doctors treat with video visits?
<br>· Cold/flu
<br>· Sore throat
<br>· Fever
<br>· Abdominal pain
<br>· Sinus infection
<br>· Pink eye
<br>· Ear infection  
<br>· Migraines
<br> 
<br>Who are the doctors?

<br>· Have an average of 15 years of experience in primary and urgent care
<br>· Are U.S. board certified, licensed and credentialed
<br>· Have profiles, so you can see their education and practice experience
<br>· Are rated by other patients, so you can review and select the doctor that meets your needs
<br>Doctors providing video visits are not affiliated with MU Health Care.
<br>Who is eligible for video visits?
<br>Patients only need access to a computer, tablet or smartphone with camera and audio. 
<br>How do video visits work?
<br>Visit with a provider by downloading and launching the video visits app on your desktop or mobile device and following the prompts to start your appointment.
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>Video visits use a secure and encrypted system that meets strict HIPAA regulations to safeguard your information.
<br>If you are an MU Health Care patient, a note about your visit will be sent to your MU Health Care provider. If you are not an MU Health Care patient, we will retain your contact information in order to inform you about services that might be of interest.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | University of Missouri |
| **Website**  | [https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits](https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits) |
| **Email** | mudoitappsdevsupport@missouri.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Division of IT 615 Locust St, Columbia, MO 65211](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Division%20of%20IT%20615%20Locust%20St,%20Columbia,%20MO%2065211) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=University+of+Missouri](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=University+of+Missouri) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | [http://www.livehealthonline.com](http://www.livehealthonline.com) |
| **Email** | help@livehealthonline.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> First time using app. First time I did an appointment, the doctor had to cancel due to technical issues. I wasnt charged for it. The second time I was able to get ahold of a doctor and she was very nice. Recommend if you are unable to make a same day appointment with doctor.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:10:06__

> App is great. Physicians can be rude.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 02:37:32__

> Great first experience! First time I used the app and it ran smoothly. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the video to submit pictures wouldn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 18:57:33__

> I can't get the sound to go up loud enough to hear the physicians.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 20:53:15__

> Quick and easy just answer a few questions and they set u up with a doctor<br> :date: __2020-09-17 00:51:43__

> Doesn't have the same options available as the website, for example, when looking for a therapist it only showed me one, but on the website there was at least a dozen or so. Could probably use some updating, but still a convenient app to use.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 00:47:30__

> My first experience was a positive one. Very easy to use. And the comfort of being @ home made talking to the dr even less stressful.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 01:17:18__

> App is easy to use. Saved me an unbelievable amount of time.<br> :date: __2020-09-08 20:19:48__

> Got me the help I needed in a quick and easy way. Only wish they had a calendar view instead of having to search a provider's availability day by day<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:00:37__

> Easy to navigate, very convenient tool to have as needed. The video functionality is sometimes hit or miss, but the provider can always call you so there's not a missed opportunity. I definitely recommend using this app for health needs.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:34:43__

> Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 03:17:22__

> I didn't like it the doctor was kind of rushing through it it was a waste of time & money<br> :date: __2020-10-07 20:32:24__

> Was not able to connect virtually. Also no where to see notes on your visit.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 18:16:06__

> The video call portion does not work. Even the provider told me to use a computer and the website because the Android app never works right. Good provider, terrible app.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:42:43__

> I had a good experience with this I was impressed with it, real simple, easy after I stared at for a minute but I'm not good with this internet stuff. I just wish they had a psychiatrist a doctor of psychology. I need a therapist as well as a doctor, I'm in need of medicine & need to vent a well.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 19:00:33__

> I'm pleased with the doctors available but the app has given me an issue with the audio each time I've used it. Is there a patch available?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 00:37:19__

> Not great at all. Took three tries to get through. I can't message the Dr. I talked to and I don't think the prescription was called in. Awful experience! It is fixed now after calling the company. They had to call in the script. Been on the phone most of the day.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 21:53:32__

> Pharmacy search didn't work first time. Time out too short. After logging in again, had to repeat same questions, but pharmacy search worked.<br> :date: __2020-04-11 20:48:29__

> Great app when it connects, have experienced issues with that despite having fast internet with no issues.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 15:30:45__

> I need a number to contact. I talked with a doctor on this app today, Wednesday March 25th. He told me I would receive an email or a message on the app from him saying we spoke and he diagnoses for me. I never recieved anything! I needed a doctor's note as well as information to show my primary care physician. Please is there a number to call to find out why I have not received this information yet?<br> :date: __2020-03-26 01:42:11__

> Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 22:45:22__

> The visit went well however i need a prior auth for an eye medication for my eyes it has been since September 2nd and it is now sept 5th and i have absolutely nothing for my eye so it went from " allergy pink eye" to full blown pink eye in my right eye i cannot contact the doctor nor can i send her a message i paid 58 dollars to see this doctor and now i have to waste time going to an urgent care just a suggestion check insurance to make sure a prior auth is not needed b 4 prescribing a med.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 22:30:20__

> I really wish it was easier to schedule an appointment with my same therapist. There should be an option to schedule my next appointment when I've finished my session. It's frustrating to have to pick dates and find my therapist's name<br> :date: __2020-08-22 14:46:16__

> Trying to see a doctor all day but the system won't verify my insurance. It wants me to pay full price then wait for reimbursement. Customer service was no help. Just told me there was no ETA to have the system running correctly. Just told me to keep trying back. Poor form LiveHealth.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 23:39:36__

> I have full covrage insurance and they tryed to tell me they cant find my provider... And all information i did twice just to be sure it was not messed up i dont have the money and nore should i pay for it when i have insurance..<br> :date: __2020-06-20 17:20:03__

> The video portion kept freezing and then halfway through my session it cut the audio down so low that I could barely hear the person on the other end. I'm really disappointed that I had to end my session all because your application could not keep the audio up.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 22:41:13__

> App worked well and I was able to get a phone call with a doctor in a few minutes. HOWEVER the phone call only lasted 3 minutes and the doctor was very rude. I wasn't even given the opportunity to share all my symptoms before he told me I should just go to urgent care. I was prescribed generic medicine for the flu. So that's good I guess but I wish I could have gotten a doctor that cared. Save your money and find a different virtual website or just go to urgent care. I'm dissapointed :(<br> :date: __2020-05-15 00:36:45__

> I lose the provider more often with this app no matter the network I connect to. I have used the app and the site. It makes me not want to use it.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 17:22:45__

> The app crashed on me while I was in line for an hour, twice! On a separate occasion, I finally got through to a doctor and he was rude, short and unhelpful. I was telling him about my symptoms and he was telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't think I will use this service again.<br> :date: __2020-04-12 20:30:33__

> Site continually drops<br> :date: __2020-03-30 22:56:17__

> Doctors dont keep appointments, doctors pick and choose who they want based on your medical history. Dont recommend bad experiences<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:15:17__

> Only good for spam. Turned off notifications but still kept getting them. Could not even use it to consult Dr. Insisted on cash up front, would not accept Anthem's insurance.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:54:51__

> Absolute garbage. The app itself feels like a 90s webpage and it's abysmal in terms of managing it's providers. Mine vanished without a trace, leaving me with needing a prescription renewal and the only way to get one was to spend another $175 on finding a new provider in the app. What's the point if you have no doctors continuity? And if this happens only occasionally, why wasn't I informed? Absolute trash -- find a better platform than this for yourself, honestly.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 13:30:53__

> Garbage. You can't select a doctor, they show you a limited list of who to pick from and none of them were licensed doctors.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 18:55:24__

> GAAAAAAHHHH!!! so frustrated!! My diagnosis, go get a lung xray....thanks for nothing!! Don't waste your time, just go to your primary.<br> :date: __2020-09-18 00:43:49__

> Let's be honest, this is a 2nd rate Teladoc. The costs are higher, even with great insurance and while there are a few good doctors to be found here, there are just as many or more aging hacks who can't understand you, want to talk over you, and who don't listen. Also, for some reason the connection is just terrible! Save yourself the $50 copay and go visit a real doctor.<br> :date: __2020-09-11 18:23:23__

### Description
> iBlueButton has been designed by physicians to allow you to have in your hands at all times your detailed medical history, enriched with personalized medical care guidance and important health safety warnings including risk factors for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). iBlueButton helps better manage your healthcare, prevent medical errors, and avoid costly unnecessary care all from the privacy and security of your device. Data is stored directly on your device, it is never shared or sold for any purpose. 
<br>iBlueButton won multiple awards over the years including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button program. iBlueButton is the first Medicare approved native mobile Blue Button application, and you can find the app listed on the Medicare.gov website (go to Manage Your Health). As a partner of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) since 2011, iBlueButton is also approved by the VA to allow Veterans to download their VA health record and assemble it into an interactive Summary Record, including graphic display of lab results & vital signs.
<br>iBlueButton can also retrieve TRICARE Blue Button records, allowing Military and their families to assemble all of their records into an enriched Summary Record.
<br>For Medicare beneficiaries & their caregivers, iBlueButton lets them login into their MyMedicare.gov account to retrieve their medical claim history which is then automatically translated into an organized medical history.
<br>Benefits of iBlueButton:
<br>- BE PREPARED WITH YOUR CRITICAL INFORMATION ALWAYS WITH YOU
<br>At the physician’s office or in the emergency room, be prepared with all the information you need securely organized and stored by iBlueButton on your smartphone or tablet. iBlueButton pulls and organizes your health records into easy to view sections. Your medical history is available for you at all times to review, research, understand medical terminology, annotate, and select the specific information you want to share.
<br>- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS
<br>iBlueButton automatically generates important safety warnings about your medications to help you prevent adverse drug effects, alerting you about highly addictive opioids and of potentially dangerous drug-drug interactions, or medications which should be avoided if you are over the age of 65. iBlueButton also provides professionally recommended medical care guidelines for common chronic conditions and now generates warnings and prevention alerts for individuals at risk for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with access to CDC prevention guidance. 
<br>- LIFE AND COST SAVING
<br>On average, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians a year, with most physicians not having the full medical history of their patients, which can cause medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place in both VA and private-sector facilities. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.
<br>- SECURE AND PRIVATE, UNDER YOUR CONTROL
<br>Unlike most personal health applications, your information is only stored securely on your device, under your control, not in the cloud. Your data remains yours, with no risk of tampering or hacking and is never shared or sold.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Humetrix, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ibluebutton.com/](http://www.ibluebutton.com/) |
| **Email** | ibb.support@humetrix.com |
| **Physical address**  | [1310 Camino Del Mar, Suite C Del Mar, CA 92014](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1310%20Camino%20Del%20Mar,%20Suite%20C%20Del%20Mar,%20CA%2092014) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

> Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 20:03:58__

> Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:31:01__

> My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 00:29:47__

> Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at "higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:33:49__

> I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:29:37__

> Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:14:19__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2019-10-15 01:10:34__

> Great app to organize your medical information found on the Medicare website in Manage your Health.<br> :date: __2019-10-04 21:19:10__

> After using iBlueButton for a couple of months I noticed it was not updating my information.  The Humetrix support team was friendly, responsive, and pro-active in addressing the issues I had with the app.  As I reported issues they fixed them promptly and genuinely seemed to appreciate my input.  IBlueButton is a useful app with the best customer support I've seen in years.<br> :date: __2019-09-28 00:31:00__

> Using this app I found not one but two pretty huge errors in the information a doctor provided to Medicare, including a medication condition I never had. Recommend.<br> :date: __2019-09-24 18:09:46__

</p>

> A QUICK and EASY Document review system for multiplatform Care Providers. My only link is : " My Health e Vet " and it allows Documented & Statistical Data Review without need to allow entry to my actual secure site. A very pleasingly designed Medical Portal Software Device.<br> :date: __2015-12-31 06:51:01__

> Concept is awesome. Needs work<br> :date: __2015-02-17 17:13:42__

> Tried it since it was updated just yesterday (wanting to stay away from old junk). It won't retain the portal information, at least for VA.  I'd put it on and save but it would erase it and all again.  I used the same info to log on to actual site with no problems.  Maybe VA has changed their portal access or something.  I am a MHV coordinator so I'd love for this to work.  Update...working perfect now!<br> :date: __2014-07-22 20:47:53__

</p>

> Still not sure but the concept is a good idea. I will try it first<br> :date: __2018-07-18 14:23:21__

> Not impressed, and for those of you that think that it's an official VA app...IT'S NOT. For security reasons, they still haven't come out with one. Until they do, this is all we have.<br> :date: __2017-10-25 11:39:17__

> The VA app is still in beta. (I know, because I'm in the beta.) Currently only VA employees can access the beta. All I can say is, it's still clunky, like most other apps I've looked at.<br> :date: __2016-11-21 20:23:02__

> Won't access tricareonline.  Unable to contact support as they filter all of those emails.<br> :date: __2016-05-13 00:32:29__

> Supposed to link to my VA page or from my VA page to the app bit doesn't. Have to manually get files/feeds but deletes previous downloaded items.<br> :date: __2015-06-18 05:46:14__

> When entering the password to protect info in the app it does a force close crash on my samsung galaxy exhibit running android  4.1.  After doing some program diagnostics the crash was the result of a  conflict with my swiping keyboard app called swype keyboard. The keyboard app causes the force close crash.<br> :date: __2015-01-19 06:34:09__

> This app seems to work fine as far as downloading my VA medical records. However, it doesn't save any info; neither reports I've just downloaded nor my personal info I just input. If I try to add my personal info from my card, the app crashes consistently.<br> :date: __2014-11-17 16:53:43__

> Sounds like it would be a good app but not able to get past logg in page. Tried uninstall and reinstall but still nothing. Ugh.<br> :date: __2018-08-21 11:55:40__

> I have downloaded and installed this app 5 times and not once have I gotten past the initial password screen. This needs to be diagnosed and  fixed. Other wise it is a pointless time investment. I am a frequent and happy user of the my healthevet application on the web. Having your health records available when you see your doctor (while maybe not essential, it is terribly convenient). we<br> :date: __2017-06-24 18:50:34__

> Great Big Fizzle on VA performance.<br> :date: __2016-04-09 02:02:09__

> Worked fine before now after I paid to get unlimited downloads it just keeps me at the loading screen.<br> :date: __2015-04-12 13:55:58__

> I've uninstall and reinstalled 2x. Unable to email record to anyone. Please fix or tell me how to fix it.<br> :date: __2014-06-29 07:28:24__

> It's a bit of work to set up. If you have an account with the VA or SSA, once you enter & verify who you are, the info should just populate itself; not hand enter everything. There's a memo pad app for that.<br> :date: __2014-03-02 06:34:16__

> I applaud the VA for launching the entire Blue Button Program.   The App is rather inmature and Will take a lot of sweat equity to bring it up to professional standards.   During my first use the App crashed entirely too much.<br> :date: __2013-06-15 05:23:08__

> This was a total waste of my time. It ask for dates for things in your childhood that no one would ever remember to add it. It also does not have all the medications that I am taking. What is the deal of listing pharmaceutical companies for meds when people go to stores to get meds? Why not just list the med.

<br>Your virtual visit may even be less expensive than your other care options, compared to urgent care clinics and emergency rooms.
<br>Simply download the app and register, and then select a provider and ‘click.’
<br>Once you select a provider, the online communication begins shortly thereafter! Telehealth providers accessed via the Penn State Health OnDemand app will diagnose, may suggest follow-up care, and can prescribe medication.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Penn State Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.pennstatehealth.org](http://www.pennstatehealth.org) |
| **Email** | innovate@pennstatehealth.psu.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Penn State Health 500 University Dr MCH162 Hershey, PA 17033](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Penn%20State%20Health%20500%20University%20Dr%20MCH162%20Hershey,%20PA%2017033) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

### Description
> Coalition is a global, privacy by design, contact tracing app to stop the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Coalition App alerts you if you have crossed paths or spent time with another user showing symptoms, or those who have tested positive for the virus.
<br>Instead of using your location data, Coalition uses secured bluetooth to protect your privacy.  Your information stays anonymous and private, and isn't shared with anyone without your permission.
<br>Only when you confirm that you are sick, does Coalition share an anonymous ID with others who you have come into contact with.
<br>We believe that citizens can help fight pandemics without giving up their privacy, Coalition is the first step to a pandemic free future.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious?

Privacy isn't much of a concern to you or your company. I definitly came to the right conclusion about this app. I saw your previous reply before you deleted it. I'm just a user. Your behaviour is disgusting. I'm reporting you to Google.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 01:33:33__

### Description
> The Intermountain Connect Care app allows you or your child to visit with an Intermountain Healthcare clinician for certain urgent care conditions using your phone or tablet.  If you have cold or flu symptoms, sinus pain, sore throat, painful urination, a minor rash or skin issue, upset stomach, or other minor symptoms, use Connect Care 24/7/365 to quickly and conveniently get the care you need from wherever you are – just $59 a visit.  Some insurance plans accepted.
<br>Connect Care is a convenient, affordable way to get care from Intermountain clinicians. Our highly-trained, board certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants have many years of experience in urgent care, clinics, and hospitals, and are specially trained to provide care using telehealth.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Intermountain Healthcare |
| **Website**  | [http://intermountainhealthcare.org](http://intermountainhealthcare.org) |
| **Email** | Customer.Support@AmericanWell.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Intermountain+Healthcare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Intermountain+Healthcare) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I am upset as i cannot remenber my password once again<br> :date: __2020-11-04 01:38:23__

> The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 19:00:53__

> The PA I saw was great, but the app seemed to have issues working properly. I could see my doctor, and I could see my video was being captured by my device, but he had trouble seeing me multiple times during the visit. I know my wifi signal is strong because I used it to work from home today. Not sure what the problem was. However, I did really, really appreciate not having to wait in a doctor's office during COVID-19. I'll continue to use the service again and see if the app works next time.<br> :date: __2020-04-09 16:39:30__

> It kept telling me that it needed more access to my phone, even when I granted all access.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:54:27__

> Kind of confusing how to set up the app<br> :date: __2020-03-26 17:05:42__

> I wasn't too impressed. The wait times were comparable to instacare, but at least I didn't have to sit in a waiting room full of sick people for 3 hours. The lady tried to prescribe me amoxicillin when I had marked that I was allergic to penicillin so I know she didn't even look over my file. Works in a pinch though.<br> :date: __2020-03-18 05:43:31__

> I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice. It's very difficult when you are trying to do psychotherapy about trauma and halfway through the connection dies or you can't hear your provider anymore. This needs lots of work!<br> :date: __2020-08-13 23:10:26__

> Every time I call it has problems connecting. It doesn't matter what wifi I am using or if im not using wifi at all. And I've also had connections with my doctors drop and had to recall and pay twice just to be seen.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 04:41:31__

> Couldn't see the others person<br> :date: __2020-06-29 22:28:45__

> The NP's and PA's are the most unhelpful and rude health professionals I've ever spoken with, and I am in healthcare. They jump to conclusions and give misinformation ( adults can't get thrush??). EDIT. The app was fine. That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 21:52:25__

> Freezes a lot.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 00:20:16__

> Worked before but now it only records the front camera (the wrong one) and the physician says they can only see lines, like a garbled old school tv. Broken video...<br> :date: __2020-04-24 06:33:34__

> The app itself is well made, but my experience made me ask myself "What's the point?". I have a sore throat and my ears have been bothering me for awhile so I finally decide to give this thing a shot. There is an option within the app that specifically states sore throat/ear problems. I get in touch with the provider and they tell me that both of those things require an in person evaluation. This is the most minor thing a person could have. If you can't diagnose it on the app what's the point?<br> :date: __2019-09-28 13:47:58__

> This app is garbage and so is the desktop version. I've been waiting an hour and a half and it just keeps glitching and kicking me out of my spot in line. It gave the option to connect with the provider by phone call instead, so I hit that option and still nothing. No call. No video appointment. Nothing.

> Was routed into this after calling a UW primary care. Initial experience was okay. Then tried to reconnect after a couple of weeks. Waited in queue for 3 days only to be dumped out after hours of waiting each day. Do the Drs. know how many patients are in their queue? When they quit, patients just seem to get cut off. On third day app tried to transfer me to a different Dr. but just cycled endlessly. Seems like Drs. can't finish their queues rationally.<br> :date: __2020-03-20 22:59:46__

> The clinic is a rip-off. The Doctors are subcontractors who can't help you with anything UW and just read you Mayo Clinic sparknotes. They couldn't answer anything about Covid-19 testing/screening even though they list th at as a feature in the app. It's a waste of $35 dollars and is practically fraud considering how they rush your meeting while dodging every question as "They Don't Know". Worse yet I called the UW Helpline and they falsely claimed that this was nessasary for appointments now.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 19:15:10__

> Could not locate my record..??<br> :date: __2020-05-27 18:23:44__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. Don't be deceived because it says UW Medicine! The UW has partnered with American Well(Amwell) in Boston and they run this clinic. Saw a virtual "DR" who was worthless for 3/4 minutes. He ordered a prescription for me but never transmitted to pharmacy. Amwell even "double dipped" into my bank account also. Beware, beware, beware of this app and don't use. It's not UW Drs that you get to see! Update: UW is cutting ties with Amwell on June 30, 2020. Yay!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 23:08:01__

> I had all the symptoms for covid except feverish temperature. Since it was difficult to get an appt at the dr. I decided to use the app to get checked, i was on the wait line for a good hr till my phone screen turned off. I opened my phone again, the app had refreshed so i had to register my patient info, symptoms,etc again. I was 31st person on the wait list, my screen timed out again and this happened another 2-3 times over 5hrs till i just gave up.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:03:39__

> Does not function, forced to rely on an app that spits me out of the queue. AWFUL.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 00:00:32__

> When I was signing up, I didn't know that there is a word limit so I tried to abbreviate and by the time I press continue, it says, my time expired so I started again. Then I started waiting under Dr Rueda at 11:47 am and by 1:23 pm I received a message that the Dr is no longer available. What? Why? Patients are in pain why the added pain. Have mercy<br> :date: __2020-03-23 22:03:39__

> It is 0 stars. I have waited for over 5 hours in their virtual waiting room, for a doctor that at some point got offline and they did not notify me. Great concept. Doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-03-19 18:25:18__

> Garbage. Waited for more than two hours with a sick kid, got bounced around to different providers before finally getting to the front of the line and the doctor was no longer available. This is not stable enough to be in production.<br> :date: __2020-03-16 05:51:51__

> Wait on hold repeatedly only to have your visit declined without explanation. App sucks. Process sucks.<br> :date: __2020-03-14 22:07:39__

> In waiting room for OVER TWO HOURS when kicked out of queue (started at #19) when showed I was at #5,. App declared provider no longer available. Logged in 3 minutes later and am now #21 FOR THE SAME PROVIDER. Customer svc at 7pm Pacific time rings a few times, then busy signal. UW if you see these reviews, please consider a different vendor for thi service. They fail at service delivery, user friendliness factor and tech support. I diagnose them as DOA.<br> :date: __2020-03-14 03:24:34__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Baptist Health South Florida |
| **Website**  | [https://baptisthealth.net/](https://baptisthealth.net/) |
| **Email** | bhsfandroiddev@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

After getting the card approved finally, was able to connect with doctor after two attempts. Dr was bear personable and asked all the right questions. Was a good experience. My theory is that the data connection needs to be at a high connection speed as this app uses a lot of data. On Verizon here so usually isn't an issue.<br> :date: __2019-12-31 18:13:56__

### Description
> Mend is a healthcare communication and engagement platform. Mend can connect to patients and/or providers anytime, anywhere, and with any device through messaging, video, forms, or other content. Mend can send or collect any information from a patient or a third party related to a patient's care. Mend is the absolute easiest, fully integrated technology to connect care.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Mend VIP, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.mendfamily.com](http://www.mendfamily.com) |
| **Email** | brandon@mendfamily.com |

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

> It takes a minute to get the information to the doctor. But then u go into video and see a doctor within 5 minutes. I got my prescription fast. I recommend this instead of going to a walk in doctor or your regular provider. During the coronavirus . I know people are scared to go to the doctor right now. This app allows you to see a doctor and not put yourself or your family in jeopardy. I'd give 10 stars or more if that was possible.

Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | TherapeuticsMD |
| **Website**  | [https://www.therapeuticsmd.com](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com) |
| **Email** | amiller@therapeuticsmd.com |
| **Physical address**  | [951 Yamato Road Suite 220, Boca Raton, FL 33431](https://www.google.com/maps/search/951%20Yamato%20Road%20Suite%20220,%20Boca%20Raton,%20FL%2033431) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=TherapeuticsMD](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=TherapeuticsMD) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
