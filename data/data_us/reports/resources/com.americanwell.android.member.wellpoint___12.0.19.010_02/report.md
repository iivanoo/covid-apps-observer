## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app has made it very easy for me to see a doctor when I am too sick to leave the house. The app is pretty easy for me to use, easier than sitting in urgent care. I Haven't had any trouble with it so far. I like that I can choose between a number of good doctors and that they can see me quick from my couch. The fact that I can see a doctor outside of normal business hours is great too. Very convenient.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 02:03:56__

> It is very convenient to see a doctor. It saves a lot of time. I recommend it highly<br> :date: __2021-01-25 00:51:30__

> Easy to use. Wish there was a place where I could keep notes for myself on whatever was discussed<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:48:29__

> My only concern is I can not figure how to raise the volume to hear the physician. Other than that I highly recommend this app. The doctors are always pleasant and they listen so they can diagnose. I am grateful to use this option even in the wee hours of the morning.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 00:08:44__

> Fast and professional<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:51:16__

> Very convenient and helpful. Doesn't take the place of in person though where tests can be run. Great to be able to talk to a professional about what's ailing you.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 19:45:38__

> First time using app. First time I did an appointment, the doctor had to cancel due to technical issues. I wasnt charged for it. The second time I was able to get ahold of a doctor and she was very nice. Recommend if you are unable to make a same day appointment with doctor.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:10:06__

> App is great. Physicians can be rude.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 02:37:32__

> Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 03:17:22__

> I didn't like it the doctor was kind of rushing through it it was a waste of time & money<br> :date: __2020-10-07 20:32:24__

> Was not able to connect virtually. Also no where to see notes on your visit.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 18:16:06__

> The video call portion does not work. Even the provider told me to use a computer and the website because the Android app never works right. Good provider, terrible app.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:42:43__

> I had a good experience with this I was impressed with it, real simple, easy after I stared at for a minute but I'm not good with this internet stuff. I just wish they had a psychiatrist a doctor of psychology. I need a therapist as well as a doctor, I'm in need of medicine & need to vent a well.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 19:00:33__

> I'm pleased with the doctors available but the app has given me an issue with the audio each time I've used it. Is there a patch available?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 00:37:19__

> Not great at all. Took three tries to get through. I can't message the Dr. I talked to and I don't think the prescription was called in. Awful experience! It is fixed now after calling the company. They had to call in the script. Been on the phone most of the day.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 21:53:32__

> Pharmacy search didn't work first time. Time out too short. After logging in again, had to repeat same questions, but pharmacy search worked.<br> :date: __2020-04-11 20:48:29__

> Great app when it connects, have experienced issues with that despite having fast internet with no issues.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 15:30:45__

> I need a number to contact. I talked with a doctor on this app today, Wednesday March 25th. He told me I would receive an email or a message on the app from him saying we spoke and he diagnoses for me. I never recieved anything! I needed a doctor's note as well as information to show my primary care physician. Please is there a number to call to find out why I have not received this information yet?<br> :date: __2020-03-26 01:42:11__

> In theory it seems good I'm having a difficult time finding any doctors. Very little appointment??<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:10:08__

> Haven't used much yet. Can't see the option for answers down below.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:30:10__

> App is very frustrating. Filled out my information and accidentally put in my credit card instead of my HSA card. I immediately cancelled and later, I received an email from my CC company stating my credit card was charged. I had to start over entering all my my information along with my son's ailments. I selected to see the first Dr. available. The app said someone would be with me soon. No estimate on how much time so I am sitting staring at my phone thinking soon would be 5 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 04:23:36__

> Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 22:45:22__

> The visit went well however i need a prior auth for an eye medication for my eyes it has been since September 2nd and it is now sept 5th and i have absolutely nothing for my eye so it went from " allergy pink eye" to full blown pink eye in my right eye i cannot contact the doctor nor can i send her a message i paid 58 dollars to see this doctor and now i have to waste time going to an urgent care just a suggestion check insurance to make sure a prior auth is not needed b 4 prescribing a med.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 22:30:20__

> I really wish it was easier to schedule an appointment with my same therapist. There should be an option to schedule my next appointment when I've finished my session. It's frustrating to have to pick dates and find my therapist's name<br> :date: __2020-08-22 14:46:16__

> Trying to see a doctor all day but the system won't verify my insurance. It wants me to pay full price then wait for reimbursement. Customer service was no help. Just told me there was no ETA to have the system running correctly. Just told me to keep trying back. Poor form LiveHealth.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 23:39:36__

> I have full covrage insurance and they tryed to tell me they cant find my provider... And all information i did twice just to be sure it was not messed up i dont have the money and nore should i pay for it when i have insurance..<br> :date: __2020-06-20 17:20:03__

> The video portion kept freezing and then halfway through my session it cut the audio down so low that I could barely hear the person on the other end. I'm really disappointed that I had to end my session all because your application could not keep the audio up.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 22:41:13__

> App worked well and I was able to get a phone call with a doctor in a few minutes. HOWEVER the phone call only lasted 3 minutes and the doctor was very rude. I wasn't even given the opportunity to share all my symptoms before he told me I should just go to urgent care. I was prescribed generic medicine for the flu. So that's good I guess but I wish I could have gotten a doctor that cared. Save your money and find a different virtual website or just go to urgent care. I'm dissapointed :(<br> :date: __2020-05-15 00:36:45__

> Doctor told me to drink more water. Regular doctor told me to go to the ER. This app is a scam and dangerous.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 15:32:09__

> It is not worth it.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 02:20:19__

> This is a scam. They took my payment then sat on a waiting screen for 30 minutes and no dr ever came to the appt. The number listed is not working either. This is a total scam and should be illegal.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 00:11:12__

> Dosent load<br> :date: __2021-01-08 20:36:02__

> Can't update card number and therefore can't even make appointments. Customer service said they'd "open a ticket for me" so I am left waiting to be able to see a dr until they're tech system is fixed for something that should be completely routine, like updating a credit card. Greedy company with garbage technology.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 18:52:40__

> $59 for a visit, the doctor recommended that I receive a COVID-19 test but the catch is, no testing sight within a hundred miles of my area would take the recommendation because this company can't send it in a fax. Had to be seen for another visit and evaluation in person and pay ANOTHER co-pay to get tested. Wasted $59 dollars. Great virtual doctor and was able to prescribe non-conrtolled substance medication, just that they're basically treated as illegitimate by actual health care facilities.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 04:41:43__

> Never used. Idk why it wants me to review??<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:32:20__
