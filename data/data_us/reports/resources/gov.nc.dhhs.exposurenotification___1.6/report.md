### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NC Department of Health and Human Services |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/SlowCOVIDNC](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/SlowCOVIDNC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> I love the concept for this app, and usually have no problems with it. However I checked it today and the app says that it has not checked for exposure in over 20 days. I don't know how to fix this issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 21:50:23__

> App works well in theory. Tested positive and never was able to get my pin to report positive result. Now app no longer checking for notifications. Hasn't checked for any since January 2, 2021<br> :date: __2021-02-08 03:18:18__

> It was ok until the non-covid, personal question was dropped on me. I deleted the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 05:11:06__

> It isn't being used by everyone. So I was exposed by a nurse who was positive. I am immunosuppressed. I am a physician. I am around most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-26 05:50:29__

> I have a situation much like the previous commenter. My last check was January 12 and I have a google phone, I tried looking into the android setting to avoid snoozing but no luck. It would also be nice to have an in app feedback troubleshooting resource. Overall it's a good idea and keeps personal data safe<br> :date: __2021-01-23 18:46:57__

> None<br> :date: __2021-01-19 22:29:47__

> Would love to tell people I've tested positive. app requires jumping through hoops my sick brain doesn't feel up to. Not useful. State already knows, plug the damned info in.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 20:53:15__

> I decided to update this review. I haven't changed the rating as of yet but probably will have to after I get some kind of answers. On January 10th, 2021 my app stopped reporting. On the 11th I had to call off from work due to a fever and symptom scare. I did test negative for Covid, but the timing of it all couldn't be worse. I mean, three days, during my wait for answers. How is that helping anyone? I work at a high traffic State facility and thought I could rely on this to help.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:34:00__

> Dont know if it really works<br> :date: __2021-01-11 15:02:14__

> Just need more people to use it.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 17:20:33__

> Exposures haven't updated for a week... Your reply didn't address my concern.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 03:03:52__

> It would be cool if it actually checked. I've updated every time in hopes it would work, but it doesn't. Its a good idea, just not very well executed. Deleting now. After months and months of use and waiting for it to work right, it just doesn't.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 16:10:44__

> I am becoming increasingly disappointed with this app. It hasn't checked exposure since January 5th 2021, that's over 5 weeks ago. Seems a pointless app. I have been opening the app almost daily. And yes, it is the latest update according to the app store and it is on the do not sleep list. Even today, Feb 15th, the last exposure check was Jan 5th.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 14:25:51__

> Was good in the beginning when the app first into being, but has gotten slack. On the main page of the app it just has that I was last notified on the 6th January 2021, and has not changed since. Thinking of deleting the app because it seems that you can't trust anyone these days. Sacrificed my 2020 year, and maybe more to come, to take care of my father by myself, no other family or friends and would like to know if I have been exposed. May have to sacrifice my life and go back to work soon.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 03:10:27__

> This app used to update daily to show potential exposures. Here we are on Feb 1 and app last updated exposures on Jan 17. Perhaps funding ran out. I will be deleting this app. Update: Ultimately had to uninstall and reinstall. Will see if it updates regularly.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 15:24:09__

> I had the app for a few months, but I never got a notification. Either COVID didn't exist where I was, or people are not using the app properly. Looking at the other reviews I'm going to go with people aren't using the app properly with no fault of their own. If it's difficult to get a pin on the app then people will be less likely to log their positive results.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 17:45:33__

> Looked like it was working until last update. Now it says the last time it checked for exposure was December 26th, a month ago?<br> :date: __2021-01-25 13:31:44__

> I am confused. I was thinking this app would check for exposures on a routine basis but my last check was back in December and I see no way of manually requesting a check. Am I missing something??<br> :date: __2021-01-21 04:03:05__

> I havent had an update since December 26, 2020. What has happened to this app<br> :date: __2021-01-21 03:02:27__

> I tested positive at a minute clinic. When I tried to enter my positive result it didn't have my information. I called and got a PIN, but when I entered it, the app still wouldn't take it. I was able to notify everyone I was in contact with that I knew, but I was out in the world a good bit.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 22:28:39__

> You should be able to report if you have been exposed to someone with covid or if you know that you had it without having a test. Example, if a family member had it and you are caring for them and you got sick, you don't need to test the know that it was from covid. That could be different levels of reporting from suspected covid to confirmed if you're worried about false reports. SMH tried to report a known exposure but can't without a test = dumb<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:04:29__

> Will not allow me to setup a pin to share my test results. States that the last time it's checked my exposure was 2 months ago!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:54:49__

> Same as to subscribers above... Update stopped in early January. I do have the latest version of the app 1.6 on Android. I have auto update set for this app as well. Someone needs to actually look into this.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 03:37:43__

> The app is not working, it has not checked for exposure since January 9th. I keep seeing where they are telling people to go to Device Care > Battery ..... That does not exist on my phone, they must be giving instructions for an iPhone.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 19:18:48__

> I know for a fact I've been exposed since this app was installed in my phone and I've never been notified. Luckily I'm smart enough to be tested<br> :date: __2021-02-17 04:31:34__

> Caught COVID with no notification that I had been exposed. Couldn't get a PIN to report my own positive test result - online said they couldn't find the record and I couldn't reach anyone by phone (made several attempts, no answer). Useless, uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 17:50:56__

> I had this on my phone thought it was supposd to tell me if someone i am around has it<br> :date: __2021-02-11 02:30:48__

> I have not had an exposure check since December 27 2020<br> :date: __2021-02-10 23:18:28__

> Stopped checking for exposure for over a month. "Solution" was to uninstall and reinstall the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 16:58:07__

> My app says it hasn't checked for exposures since Jan 15, is this an issue with my phone or with the app?<br> :date: __2021-02-09 03:09:09__

> Needs Bluetooth on all the time to get the warnings. I don't leave my Bluetooth on like that.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 05:34:43__
