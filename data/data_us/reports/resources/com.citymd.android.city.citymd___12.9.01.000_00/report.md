## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City Practice Group of New York, LLC |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | aftercare@citymd.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Wait til some patients try going back to this site & find that their regular email addresses &/or passwords are "not correct", even though you know it is. The site can't hold onto what you may have entered, regardless of whether CityMD gave out the temporary psword or you chose it yourself, you most likely end up having to re register again.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 00:29:37__

> Discontinued your service to move over to Summit Health before you were ready with an Android app? Brilliant work. Way to exclude every android owner seeking Healthcare with you.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 02:12:05__

> Who the hell do you think you are telling me that I need wifi to use video conferencing? This is pathetic BS. You have no idea how fast my wifi is and how fast my mobile data is. My mobile data is 5G and performs VERY well. I do NOT need wifi to use video. Don't you ever force users to do BS like this. Now I have to walk around and find some inferior wifi spot that will be slower than my 5G, and the main medical issue here is that after COVID, I cannot walk around too much. PATHETIC!!!!!!<br> :date: __2021-03-28 20:41:01__

> Wasted time filling everything out and the doctor cancelled the visit...<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:17:15__

> I can't login to the app with the same credentials that I logged in on desktop website. I tried resetting my password, but app didn't even find my account either. Yikes. Zero star<br> :date: __2020-08-27 14:18:37__

> You can't even log on to the app doesn't matter how many times I try and i know for a fact that it's the Right information until this issue is worked out i would stick to Checking online<br> :date: __2020-08-14 00:09:32__

> Useless app<br> :date: __2020-08-08 14:20:58__

> My insurance is not listed for the virtual appointments, only in-person appts.<br> :date: __2020-08-06 01:48:15__

> Looks like scam.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 07:29:36__

> Took Covid19 test<br> :date: __2020-07-06 23:04:39__

> As of July 02, 2020 at 5:30pm, there is a problem with the app. If you create an account thru the web using your computer, or by responding to the "patient portal" e-mail first, the app will not recognize your username or password chosen thru the web. Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__
