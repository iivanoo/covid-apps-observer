## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's nice to get good care at home<br> :date: __2021-02-26 23:03:42__

> App is a great idea, but the doctor needs to be in a quieter room, ie curtains or something on the walls and acoustic tiles on the ceiling, somehing to help absorb the noise, sort of echoes. Also even with 4 bars the video and audio froze up twice, needs to use less bandwidth<br> :date: __2021-02-26 22:46:55__

> I would've given a better rating it it wasn't for the fact that they added my sister along with my mother as family members suffering from dementia. They didn't provide a way for me to correct the misinformation.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 00:49:51__

> I don't have insurance because I can't afford it and Doctor on Demand is very expensive.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 18:21:55__

> Dr great. Tech not so good.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:48:28__

> The doctor was fine, but the audio was atrocious. Turns out you have to manually tell the app to switch to headphones from speaker even with wireless or wired headphones active on your device. I didn't figure this out until the end of the call. That is some backwards technology.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 16:05:41__

> Cannot schedule a future appt unless it's today or tomorrow. When scheduling an appt. The app should auto select the previous physician.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 22:04:11__

> App worked fine but the customer service messaging is absolute horsesh&t. I left 3 messages and waited days for a response. I then called the phone number. I was quickly able to get a real human on the phone who told me I had to wait days for a response. All this was just to replace a 4 day supply of antibiotics I recieved from the Dr. A 4 day supply that was as you can imagine pretty time sensitive as most courses of antibiotics are. So my only other option was to pay another $75 fee.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 20:45:47__

> Money hungry just like all the other docs....gave meds 2 days, weren't working. Called support because there is no way to call the doc you saw. Told me I'd have to pay ANOTHER $75 to get a med change!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:13:46__

> Everything but choosing a pharmacy worked fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:33:52__

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__



#### 2-star reviews

> Ive used yhis app 3 times. 2 of the times they didnt fulfill the papeework requirement i had to return ti work. Which makes you have to go back a 2nd time. Last time took 5 wks for them to get a pi release for me to give dr and they never contacted him to sign paperwork. lost the job.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 00:50:25__

> The consulting service itself is great, and the doctors have been both helpful and professional, but the app/service restricting the ability to make appointments based on your current location and not the location where you'll have returned to in... I don't know... 5 weeks' time when the appointment ACTUALLY is scheduled is more than a little frustrating. Not only that, booking on a PC isn't allowed without camera access. Except I don't have a camera installed on this PC, and I don't intend to use it for the appointment. App developers, please consider that the devices and locations used during the appointment booking process may not reflect those used at the time of service and be more flexible. Show a warning: "This doctor is not licensed in your current state. Please ensure you have returned to your state of residence at the time of your appointment." or perhaps "Please note that this service will require camera access at the time of your appointment." These restrictions should only apply at the time of service. What's to stop me from booking an appointment in the correct state and on a device with a webcam, only to lack both of those at or near the time of the appointment? THAT'S the issue you need to address. Not the arbitrary one you're creating for your users. Overall, it's a good service with a restricted app and website that don't even necessarily address the issues for which they've made the app/website so restrictive.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:27:12__

> No callback or reconnect function of your internet drops during the call so you have to reschedule for the next appointment which could be days or weeks away very unprofessional for an app in 2021<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:49:18__

> Filter needs more detail. I cant put location in and other details.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:09:42__

> They give me wrong info i ended up having sergey instead<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:20:52__

> Visit was easy and fast but I can't get the prescription they filled for me because my pharmacy said the directions were "unclear" I sent a support message immediately after and I'm still waiting to hear back. I am out of this medication so I hope they can get back to me quickly.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:01:24__

> Doctors are great!! Super nice and always so helpful! Usually never a long wait. But don't ever have any questions to submit to the support team. I have message multiple times with no reply. Literally week 3 of no responses. I need a doctor's note for work, the doctor forgot to send it to me. I reached out January 15 for one, and nothing no responses at all.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:10:21__

> Huge scam. They said they would provide a service and didn't. Just told me to go see a local doctor for a simple condition that they claim they can help with. How does that help?<br> :date: __2021-03-05 03:50:48__

> Does not take my insurances.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 15:24:08__

> What If I want to speak to a doctor without having any symptoms? Not clear if available.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 04:31:33__

> Had to change my review to one star. Sick as a dog won't go into detail but need to be seen by medical professionals and the app just will not work. Go for an appointment and it just loading and then says sorry try again later. Well after 5 hrs and trying along the way I still can't get threw<br> :date: __2021-02-28 16:37:34__

> Insurance acceptance always glitchy<br> :date: __2021-02-28 14:56:46__

> only wanf to use this app when i am sick and it is so frustrating to use I give up<br> :date: __2021-02-26 23:18:05__

> Cannot get payment option to explain what is needed.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 23:56:18__

> Can't give referrals<br> :date: __2021-02-23 16:37:46__

> I have changes my 5 star review to a 1 star! For urgent care services and to avoid a trip to the emergency room, this app has been great! However, my most recent experiences have not been the same. I have made 3 appointments for therapy services and each time we are prepared waiting for the appointment to start and the appointment drops or is canceled within minutes. Very disappointing!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:23:20__

> Incompetence, telling me they called in my prescription, and they didn't. Connection problems on there part. If I could give a 0., I would. Warning.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 00:42:47__
