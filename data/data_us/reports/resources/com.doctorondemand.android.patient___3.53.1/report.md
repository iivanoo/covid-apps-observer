## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Doctor was available quicker than estimated, and showed concern while providing fast care. And free through my insurance! Will use again if needed. Edit: used today for a different medical concern. The doctor ordered labs immediately, gave me homework, and asked for a follow-up visit to build a plan. I feel better already knowing my concerns are being addressed.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 23:50:54__

</p>

> It's nice to get good care at home<br> :date: __2021-02-26 23:03:42__

> App is a great idea, but the doctor needs to be in a quieter room, ie curtains or something on the walls and acoustic tiles on the ceiling, somehing to help absorb the noise, sort of echoes. Also even with 4 bars the video and audio froze up twice, needs to use less bandwidth<br> :date: __2021-02-26 22:46:55__

> Awesome!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:57:22__

> Great help for a quick easy visit to the dr for minor aliment that needed medical prescription .<br> :date: __2021-02-26 16:09:57__

> It was great for me perfect I'll advise anybody if you need to talk with the doctor to go ahead and download the app in talk to a doctor I got my prescription I'm good<br> :date: __2021-02-25 23:51:04__

> Other than some tech glitches, very useful.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 15:56:52__

> Good very informative!<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:39:41__

> I have overall enjoyed my use of D.O.D, however, what needs to be improved upon is the scheduling. There seems to be an issue always when trying to schedule follow-up appointments (at least for me - i.e. no dates available). I don't have time to check the app every day to see if there are openings. Outside of this hiccup, I don't have any other issues with the app. Very convenient.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 05:26:59__

> A big hell ya. No one feels like getting out of PJ's when you feel bad and the Cova Cloud is lerking.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:37:37__

> It's a good option for a lot of more minor problem's. The audio kept breaking up but the weather is horrible and that was a connection issue not Dr..onD. 's fault.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 20:09:58__



#### 3-star reviews

</p>

> Dr great. Tech not so good.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:48:28__

> The doctor was fine, but the audio was atrocious. Turns out you have to manually tell the app to switch to headphones from speaker even with wireless or wired headphones active on your device. I didn't figure this out until the end of the call. That is some backwards technology.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 16:05:41__

> Cannot schedule a future appt unless it's today or tomorrow. When scheduling an appt. The app should auto select the previous physician.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 22:04:11__

> App worked fine but the customer service messaging is absolute horsesh&t. I left 3 messages and waited days for a response. I then called the phone number. I was quickly able to get a real human on the phone who told me I had to wait days for a response. All this was just to replace a 4 day supply of antibiotics I recieved from the Dr. A 4 day supply that was as you can imagine pretty time sensitive as most courses of antibiotics are. So my only other option was to pay another $75 fee.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 20:45:47__

> Money hungry just like all the other docs....gave meds 2 days, weren't working. Called support because there is no way to call the doc you saw. Told me I'd have to pay ANOTHER $75 to get a med change!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:13:46__

> Everything but choosing a pharmacy worked fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:33:52__

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> No callback or reconnect function of your internet drops during the call so you have to reschedule for the next appointment which could be days or weeks away very unprofessional for an app in 2021<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:49:18__

> Filter needs more detail. I cant put location in and other details.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:09:42__

> They give me wrong info i ended up having sergey instead<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:20:52__

> Visit was easy and fast but I can't get the prescription they filled for me because my pharmacy said the directions were "unclear" I sent a support message immediately after and I'm still waiting to hear back. I am out of this medication so I hope they can get back to me quickly.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:01:24__

> Doctors are great!! Super nice and always so helpful! Usually never a long wait. But don't ever have any questions to submit to the support team. I have message multiple times with no reply. Literally week 3 of no responses. I need a doctor's note for work, the doctor forgot to send it to me. I reached out January 15 for one, and nothing no responses at all.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:10:21__

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> Cannot get payment option to explain what is needed.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 23:56:18__

> Can't give referrals<br> :date: __2021-02-23 16:37:46__

> I have changes my 5 star review to a 1 star! For urgent care services and to avoid a trip to the emergency room, this app has been great! However, my most recent experiences have not been the same. I have made 3 appointments for therapy services and each time we are prepared waiting for the appointment to start and the appointment drops or is canceled within minutes. Very disappointing!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:23:20__

> Incompetence, telling me they called in my prescription, and they didn't. Connection problems on there part. If I could give a 0., I would. Warning.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 00:42:47__

> They say if you have Medicare you pay 0! I was looking for a counselor not an MD. But what they dont say is, you can't get a counselor for an appointment unless your paying full price with no insurance! I tried with an alternate log in without insurance and could get an appointment right away, but with Medicare I couldn't even get an appointment period!!! This app is a freaking scam! Thanks for the help!<br> :date: __2021-02-17 00:08:01__
