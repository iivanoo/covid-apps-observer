### Description
> Let your smartphone notify you to potential exposure to COVID-19–using fully anonymous Bluetooth signals–and help stop the spread of coronavirus in Arizona.
<br>Get peace of mind by taking this small step and start rebuilding trust in your community – install this free app, released in partnership with the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS).
<br>Once you opt-in and enable exposure notification on your phone, Covid Watch works in the background, automatically detecting if you come into close proximity with someone else, without tracking you by GPS or ever revealing any personal data.
<br> 
<br>The more people participate, the more effective we can be. Encourage your friends, family, and colleagues to install Covid Watch today. Members of the following campus communities can access a customized version of the app: 
<br>• University of Arizona
<br>• Northern Arizona University 
<br>Provided by Covid Watch, an Arizona non-profit organization dedicated to your health and privacy.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app is Amazing and I love it. This should be launched across USA and it will help in saving allot of people from exposure of Covid-19. Everyone in Arizona should download and start using it.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 13:43:59__

> The idea is great/it is easy to set up/explains how it works well. I will rate 5 simply for that. It definitely needs to be able to be discovered by searching 'covid arizona' or 'covid watch arizona'. I had to look it up on a search engine then go through an app store link on the dev's website to find it.<br> :date: __2020-09-11 05:38:37__

> Thanks for making this!<br> :date: __2020-09-10 10:11:21__

> Excellent application !<br> :date: __2020-08-24 13:16:53__

> Just what AZ needs to kick the covid! Hopefully everyone will install. I'm glad it protects privacy.<br> :date: __2020-08-19 20:42:29__

> It's a major flaw to have to deliberately dig for this and install. I'm not saying it should be force installed on any device but it should at /least/ be able to show up in a search 🙃<br> :date: __2020-10-09 02:43:42__

> This app can't be found using a simple search for "Covid Watch Arizona".<br> :date: __2020-08-26 04:58:02__

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> How do I know it is working? Ghe help section has way to many choices. I think I'd be there for hours and still not get help.<br> :date: __2020-10-12 18:48:01__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from?<br> :date: __2020-09-05 21:40:37__
