## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Lafayette General Health System, Inc |
| **Website**  | [http://www.lafayettegeneral.com](http://www.lafayettegeneral.com) |
| **Email** | mobileapps@lgh.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> They have better doctors and nurses here at lafayette general online than they do in person at the same place. She was very helpful and nice. I'll be following up with PCP soon for a referral to a GI specialist. This was very helpful especially since I got to do it at 10pm and not even have to get out of bed. I will say the audio cuts out a bit at times but it wasn't awful especially since I didn't have to go anywhere for it.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 05:11:31__
