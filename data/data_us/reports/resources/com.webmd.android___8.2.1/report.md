## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A great resource for all things health and medical-related. I use the symptom checker feature the most, but the app also features articles on health conditions, information on different medications, and COVID articles. Definitely a great resource, and completely free!<br> :date: __2020-10-10 06:43:39__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> Great info🚑🤗🦋<br> :date: __2020-07-08 16:35:23__

> Useful.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 23:21:02__

> I like this app especially for possible interactions,which is very important for me but I had problems making an account<br> :date: __2020-06-23 22:04:53__

> Very helpful<br> :date: __2020-06-07 01:14:28__

> Helps. Not always consistant though and i wish i could save and label the session so dont have to reenter all symptoms again justbto add 1 or 2 more.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 01:53:56__

> Too many ads<br> :date: __2020-11-16 03:43:46__

> I allow access to my location, it gives me doctors & professions that aren't even close to my area! I put my zip code in & I get nothing! This is ongoing even with updates! Be careful! Stay safe! 😷😷😷😷🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💜💜💜💜<br> :date: __2020-10-27 23:37:12__

> Put in symptoms and it just kept saying I'm diabetic which I'm not but it is does have a lot of info<br> :date: __2020-08-24 06:00:08__

> Cant edit my birthday<br> :date: __2020-08-07 16:48:00__

> Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 15:57:52__

> Hard to put in my health symptoms. Touchy with even short word descriptions. Like trying to crack a code that you know nothing about.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 15:02:31__

> Love this app. Very useful. Had to take off 2 stars because the database is missing many medications and conditions.<br> :date: __2020-06-22 06:31:47__

> Not what it use to be<br> :date: __2020-06-14 07:40:45__

> The medication reminders are working any more<br> :date: __2020-05-28 03:36:51__

> Symptom checker isn't working anymore.<br> :date: __2020-05-18 07:41:38__

> I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:18:03__

> This was a great app especially with the symptoms checker but now that feature doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 15:26:48__

> I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:02:53__

> I have found that searching for certain terms, such as "dementia", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:13:12__

> The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 18:00:51__

> Notifications have become political. Delete<br> :date: __2020-10-09 02:43:16__

> Not user-friendly<br> :date: __2020-10-03 08:56:22__

> I couldn't find some of the meds I take. I'm not sure if this app is aware of Canadian medicine terms and generic drug names. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 21:12:12__

> Stopped working after last update...7/28/20<br> :date: __2020-08-01 23:20:50__
