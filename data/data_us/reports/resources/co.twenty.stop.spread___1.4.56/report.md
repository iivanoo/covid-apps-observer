## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Udate..issues being adressed..will change my rating once resolved ..Thankyou twenty inc for tesponding.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 02:37:58__

> Easy to set up however, birthdate field fails. I entered correct date, confirmed it is the date on file with me provider, app indicates error, dates don't match.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 18:14:10__

> Good app but for COVID tests the report of the results it gives does not include the resulted date, just the date of the taken same. This resulted test date is determinant for some travel requirements that are time sensitive.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 04:39:13__

> Why doesn't this app use the exposure notifications API in Android?<br> :date: __2021-01-24 01:04:24__

> This app needs to configure merging existing charts. It creates way too many duplicates in the system for employees which creates more work in contacting patients.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 18:31:58__

> What is my result<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:08:46__

> need check deeper<br> :date: __2021-01-14 16:31:50__

> First, I'm not sure where the problem is? The wife and I had both the Rapid and the Oral Swab done exactly the same time. She had her Rapid results in a couple hours. I never recieved mine? I called the day after and got my results. The text and E-Mail notification was supposedly sent to me, I never recieved anything? This is not the first time. Last year, the same issue? So, if the app is part of the process there is an issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:04:15__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:17:35__

> I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:10:50__
