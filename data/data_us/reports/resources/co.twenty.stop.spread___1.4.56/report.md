## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app needs to configure merging existing charts. It creates way too many duplicates in the system for employees which creates more work in contacting patients.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 18:31:58__

> First, I'm not sure where the problem is? The wife and I had both the Rapid and the Oral Swab done exactly the same time. She had her Rapid results in a couple hours. I never recieved mine? I called the day after and got my results. The text and E-Mail notification was supposedly sent to me, I never recieved anything? This is not the first time. Last year, the same issue? So, if the app is part of the process there is an issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:04:15__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:17:35__

> I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:10:50__

> Does not work with older phones.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 02:14:33__
