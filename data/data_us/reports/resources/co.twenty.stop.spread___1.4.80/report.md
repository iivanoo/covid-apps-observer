## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 17:11:31__

> The test took 6 days ,I asked for tje test results to be sooner I was told no more then 3 days,so I had a flight to n.y. booked ,I needed the papers cleared of covid which I am negative.but didn't get them on time so the airline said I could not fly with out it..So ticket was none refundable ,so I not only I could not go to n.y. I also lost the 200 dollar ticket I paid for....Again i asked for the results to be sooner and it took 6 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:06:29__

> Its not fully downloading the apps<br> :date: __2021-02-14 18:11:34__

> Mostly useless. Contact tracing isn't good sincere there isn't wide adoption. If the symptom checker tells you to get tested, it provides contact information which is usually wrong. Test results take days to post here - long after I've heard back from other sources.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 19:55:56__

> please be advised that I went and I get three negative test and I went to the Hospital and get tested positive couple days after however the individual that's doing the test are not taking it seriously<br> :date: __2021-02-11 04:43:44__

> It been trying to download fr the last 30 minutes<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:09:21__

> It's useless if it only downloads 67%NOW its just spinning and spinning and said not all features available in Florida....grrrrr<br> :date: __2021-02-06 16:29:03__

> Cannot get pin no. To verify phone no. Use mobile instead of land line and it works fine.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 18:17:36__
