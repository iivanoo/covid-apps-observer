## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Twenty+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So what do I do if my name is listed wrong and therefore cannot see my results<br> :date: __2021-02-02 21:03:21__

> This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 17:11:31__

> Its not fully downloading the apps<br> :date: __2021-02-14 18:11:34__

> Mostly useless. Contact tracing isn't good sincere there isn't wide adoption. If the symptom checker tells you to get tested, it provides contact information which is usually wrong. Test results take days to post here - long after I've heard back from other sources.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 19:55:56__

I did the troubleshoots, cleared caches, wrote u a reply text, and get No help at all. It's a Covid result, not some super private AIDS test.

> Been attempting to download the app for three hours. I scanned the code square which brought me to the browser. From the browser it brought me to the app store to install from online. Then after logging into my Google account to give permission, it said that it would notify me when completed. It's been 3 hours. I then just tried this time from Google Play Store and it's still swirling for ten minutes. This is the "easiest" way to get my results?<br> :date: __2021-03-10 17:58:59__
