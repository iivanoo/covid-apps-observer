## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App won't accept username, and will not let me log in, even though username fits their parameters. Cannot rate the rest of the app, since it will not let me create an account.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 16:47:36__

> Log in tedious and time consuming waiting for confirmation codes in messages that don't auto enter.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 23:13:33__

> I was hoping to used the app as a digital fishing license, but evey time I try to use the video/photo verification the camera is way to dark that it barely picks up any light in the area unless it's natural light. There should be an alternative way to authenticate because now this app is completely useless for me.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 22:47:30__

> This app is hot trash. Very slow, had to authenticate 4+ times to just use this. At that point physical ID is preferable to this<br> :date: __2021-07-11 20:30:18__

> No screenshot? Need easier share.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 23:05:02__

> Waste of time. I've referred so many people to this app too. Then like a month ago useless. I can't open the insurance at all the app just closes. Stupid really. Why bother if I can't store everything in one place. UGH<br> :date: __2021-07-07 14:14:29__

> Garbage app. Can't even create an account without error codes for problems I don't have. Password has everything it needs; a number, symbol, upper and lower case number. App will give you error code saying you dont meet requirements. I hope they didnt put a dime of tax dollars into this hot dumpster fire of app. Nice idea. Aaaaaaaaawwwwffuuuuuuuuuul execution.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 07:25:25__

> Installed just fine, however to use it you have to upload a "face map" that doesn't seem to work. I have changed lighting and angel......... Seems broken, possibly phone camera incomparably.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 00:36:42__

> The app updated and forgot my credentials; that makes it real handy when you're trying to show identification... Even video games can use SSO to ensure you can log in quickly every time, don't you think an app with such an important purpose as proving one's identity should be able to do that?!<br> :date: __2021-07-16 16:18:41__

> I put in the year for the fishing / hunting license and then I'm able to view license for about 5 seconds and then it disappears<br> :date: __2021-07-16 16:14:50__

> I thought it would be a great place to keep things as we move our physical credentials into the digital age. Bottom line, if you don't login to this app at least every 90 days, your account is scrubbed and you have to start from scratch. This is not worth my time involved to set everything up all over again.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 22:46:42__

> Junk doesn't work can't even login... Stay clear just carry your ID allot easier then trying to get this to work...<br> :date: __2021-07-15 04:08:05__

> Yes no one reads reviews, and this app sucks balls 😒<br> :date: __2021-07-14 02:21:32__

> Every time I need to use it it needs an update??<br> :date: __2021-07-13 23:43:20__

> This app is trash. Everytime I try to take a picture of the back of my ID. It forecloses.<br> :date: __2021-07-13 23:20:35__

> Having same issues like everyone else. Not able to login. Tried using the forgot password and user name but none of them work. I haven't received any emails for the past couple of weeks. It worked great before but not sure what happened.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 23:42:16__
