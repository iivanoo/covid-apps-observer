## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Clunky. Took multiple attempts to log in only for the app to fail multiple times. Could not find my recorda and told me to email. What's the point of an app that can't submit a request to the administrator within it.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 19:53:02__

> App won't accept username, and will not let me log in, even though username fits their parameters. Cannot rate the rest of the app, since it will not let me create an account.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 16:47:36__

> Log in tedious and time consuming waiting for confirmation codes in messages that don't auto enter.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 23:13:33__

> I was hoping to used the app as a digital fishing license, but evey time I try to use the video/photo verification the camera is way to dark that it barely picks up any light in the area unless it's natural light. There should be an alternative way to authenticate because now this app is completely useless for me.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 22:47:30__

> This app is hot trash. Very slow, had to authenticate 4+ times to just use this. At that point physical ID is preferable to this<br> :date: __2021-07-11 20:30:18__

> No screenshot? Need easier share.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 23:05:02__

> Waste of time. I've referred so many people to this app too. Then like a month ago useless. I can't open the insurance at all the app just closes. Stupid really. Why bother if I can't store everything in one place. UGH<br> :date: __2021-07-07 14:14:29__

> Doesn't show any current hunting/fishing licenses or Parks passes regardless of if they were purchased one day ago or 6 months ago<br> :date: __2021-06-28 04:54:39__

> Every time I attempt to get my insurance cards, the application crashes.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 04:06:00__

> This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with "certificate errors" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 06:47:57__

> I verify myself then It just goes back to login screen<br> :date: __2021-07-23 10:54:40__

> Tried to create an account and it won't scan my license. I spent a solid 5 minutes trying to get it to scan (changed lighting, background, etc) and nothing. So it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 20:29:09__

> Difficult to get started, I've spent over 30 minutes trying to get it to accept my username or password in the initial setup. My username and password fit the required parameters, but it requires more than that for both username and password. Once I figured that out and got it working I now have a username I'll never remember and a password that I'm also probably going to forget. With how difficult this was to get started I wouldn't be shocked if I delete it during my next login attempt.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 20:29:27__

> Loses documents that have been uploaded, deactivates your account randomly without any notice, can't reset password, help desk support is incompetent.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 16:24:44__

> Waste of time. Doesn't scan the barcode, does not offer any help. I wouldn't even bother looking at it. Plus, the support team was absolutely no help.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 18:14:25__

> Set up a digital ID just for the app to no be able to pull it up this app is trash<br> :date: __2021-07-20 13:40:44__

> Just don't do it.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 02:16:49__

> It would have been a great experience if it WORKED.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 00:34:03__

> My driver's license won't come up. I get a message that says let verify you for your first time and then a blank white page just stays up. I really needed to show my license and my physical license wasn't accepted because it had a crack in it. I was depending on the digital copy and it never showed up. I also couldn't get any help on app<br> :date: __2021-07-19 23:15:36__

> Great idea but this app doesn't work on android at least. I got registered and logged in without issue, but then when I try to view my digital ID it says "For your security, let's verify your identity before you access your digital ID for the first time" so you click ok, it goes to a white screen, and does nothing.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 19:37:43__
