## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> As expected, no problems. Very convenient to see the Dr without having to go into the office. I don't see how to schedule appointments, though; that would be an excellent feature to add.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 22:17:30__

> When in call the sound plays on earpiece not on speaker. The menu option for speaker have no effect and its very difficult to hear such a low voice while having video conference. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 06:53:34__

> Connection is a little touch n go even with perfect service. But overall it's a good app.<br> :date: __2018-10-08 19:56:13__



#### 2-star reviews

</p>

> Crappy App<br> :date: __2020-09-28 19:08:53__

> It isn't very consistent. Constantly goes in and out. Very irritating when you are trying to talk and listen to your child's doctor and its all messed up.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 20:18:13__

> Functional but not nearly as good of video image and sound connection as a simple Zoom, Google Plus, or WhatsApp. Better than nothing. We were required to use this by our healthcare provider, and it really compromise the ability to communicate during a very important visit.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 16:24:34__



#### 1-star reviews

> They used to be good but now they are absolutely a waste of time, all they do now is tell you to visit their office to have the child seen. Hello!! We don't feel safe taking our kids into an urgent care right now. What's the point of this app if you no longer do anything.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 00:36:36__

> Lagging. Voice going in and out. Not able to hear what the other person saying. Screen freezing.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:07:11__

> After waiting almost 45 minutes, the app kicked me out of the waiting, and I had to request a new visit because the Doctor I chose was unavailable. I waited almost two hours, when there were only 2 patients ahead of me. I ended up cancelling the visit because I got tired of waiting online. Not worth it!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 04:13:51__

> Worst Experience Ever! Only once the app has worked for us, rest multiple times it just fails. It says "connecting doctors video" but than fails and says your appointment is canceled. One day we were on hold for 4.5 hours, first it failed call the customer service they reset the appointment, than we waited and the doctor transferred to another doctor and post that failed again. Our friends us CHOP and have never faced such issues.Not sure if its the app or Nemours practices. Will not recommend<br> :date: __2020-07-25 16:52:37__

> Pediatric? Only adult options were listed<br> :date: __2020-07-19 01:15:40__

> Very frusterating. Stayed on the phone for hour just to have the Dr hang up on me due to no connection and i would have full barns on WIFI sitting right next to the box. For days i have been trying to get this to work. And everytime i call the office they just direct me back to this app. On the me help u and it never works. Cant even get my kid seen. Very pissed off mom<br> :date: __2020-07-17 22:37:56__

> The Clermont location is terrible. The staff is incompetent and rude. They do not care about the babies and only want to push products on you without listening to your concerns or needs. Do not go to Nemours in Clermont FL!!! You will be very unhappy!!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 22:39:04__

> My toddler fell outside and cut open his eyebrow. I did not want to go to the urgent care or ER and expose us to c- virus, so I tried the care connect app for urgent care. We were 11th in line waiting. After over an hour and a half of waiting we were still 3rd in line so I left the app running and pulled up my camera to get a new photo of the injury. I switched back over to the app, to see the doctor had declined seeing us. It would've been nice if the app had some type of way to alert you.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 00:06:50__

> Would give zero stars if I could. It says online that they treat ear infections, so I booked an appointment. She has an ear pain and a fever. They said she doesnt have an ear infection and even if she did they wouldn't treat her. That means I just wasted $60. Don't waste your time. Go to a real doctor. I know my doctor would've treated her infection because she's my 4th child and I've been through this many times. I'm so upset! This is what I get for trying to take shortcuts!<br> :date: __2020-03-26 23:36:46__

> Absolutely useless waited 1hr for the doctor to log off and the system to kick me out and make me start all over.........I could wait till morning and see my primary faster<br> :date: __2020-03-25 03:04:17__
