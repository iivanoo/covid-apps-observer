### Description
> This app was developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) as a component of their COVID-19 homeless response strategy. The app is designed to equip homeless outreach workers across LA County to triage the sick and most vulnerable and monitor spread among the 50,000+ people experiencing homelessness in LA County. 
<br>This app enables outreach teams and coordinators toâ€¦
<br>- Conduct surveys with individuals experiencing homelessness to determine best safety advice or course of action for those who are symptomatic (survey developed by doctors at Housing for Health, Division at the Department of Health Services based on FEMA and CDC guidance). 
<br>- See locations of individuals in need of outreach follow up.
<br>- View hotspots of individuals and homeless encampments to track resource and response needs countywide.
<br>Use of this application is available to any current or new homeless outreach worker tasked with triaging the sick and most vulnerable and monitoring spread of COVID-19 (authorized by homeless service providers and governing bodies like the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority).

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
