### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut, supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CTDPH to know where or who you are for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CDPH.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CT Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | [http://ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct) |
| **Email** | DPH.covidalertct@ct.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [State of Connecticut Department of Public Health 410 Capital Avenue Hartford, CT,  06103](https://www.google.com/maps/search/State%20of%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health%20410%20Capital%20Avenue%20Hartford,%20CT,%2006103) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.
