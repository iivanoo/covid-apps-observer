## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is fine but I was out of town and needed to input a Pharmacy in the town I am visiting. The App did not give me an opportunity to do that. Thankfully I remembered this and told the doctor. i would have been very frustrated if the prescription was sent back to my hometown.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 22:49:27__

> They double charged my card for one visit. Was on hold for 30+ minutes with customer support and still wasn't able to get ahold of anyone. Extremely frustrated. The app itself is a good idea and talking to a doctor was convenient from home. Just dont like being charged twice.<br> :date: __2020-03-19 13:50:21__

> the doctors are knowledgeable and it's wonderful to have an option to see a care provider virtually. my major issue is connectivity. i waited in queue for 30 minutes to see a provider and was kicked out, having to start all over again and wait for even longer to get assistance.<br> :date: __2019-01-10 16:27:45__

> It's a good start.  When signing up I had to enter my DOB which was difficult.  The calender defaulted to 2016 and no way to easily change it.  I had to tap 60 times to get to my DOB.<br> :date: __2017-06-20 01:16:28__

> Don't waste your time. They tell you they can't treat you and to see a doctor and still charge for a 3 minute conversation for something that supposedly can be treated with this service. Never again.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 16:43:06__

> I just downloaded the app to sign up for a virtual dr. Appointment. Had the appointment then tried to get back on to see if my prescription had been filled. The pharmacy didn't have any record of the dr. Sending any prescription. The app won't let me sign back on asit doesn't recognize the email I used. I literally just signed up an hour before but the app doesnt recognize my email now. How frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-05-08 23:36:43__
