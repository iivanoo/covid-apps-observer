## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Better with Dr Mc Duffie.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 15:32:57__

> Great service, app can be a bit annoying, but it's full of useful information<br> :date: __2020-07-20 22:40:40__

> Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.<br> :date: __2018-10-01 01:48:41__

> Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5<br> :date: __2018-09-28 06:26:18__

> The app works great for scheduling and getting regular updates, but I wish 
I could access the care plans from within the app, rather than needing to 
go to the website; it makes me question why I should use the app over the 
website.<br> :date: __2018-05-04 18:36:50__

> Thought I would give it a try and was pleased. Showed up early in their window. Noted they claim they work with Cogna but not sure. For me the convenience was well worth the extra price over sitting in some ready center. Will use this service again.<br> :date: __2018-03-06 22:59:40__

> Great app, I needed the flu shot asap the doc showed up gave me the shot all done with in 10 minutes. I will definitely be using the heal app again.<br> :date: __2018-02-19 18:00:59__

> Ive heard about this app on Dr. Drews show. I belive this app has alot of potential but its not available in moreno valley. When can we expect more areas???<br> :date: __2016-05-23 20:04:57__

> There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:49:22__

> Waiting patiently for HEAL to come to my area in Florida!<br> :date: __2019-10-29 03:29:26__

> My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2018-12-04 20:06:26__

> When entering birthday, a required field, the only method is using the pop up calendar which defaults to today's date and only let's you go back one month at a time, so if you are 30 years old, you need to tap the back arrow at least 360 times to get to your birthday, really? Why not allow someone to just type it in?? No healthy person would want to do this let alone a sick person. Terrible UI design.<br> :date: __2017-11-25 07:58:07__

> There is no services in the Las Vegas,  NV valley @ all.  We need the doctor sevices here.  We have to wait 2 to 3 months to get in for appointments.  It is a shame or waiting in line @ Urgent care for 2 or 3 hours..<br> :date: __2016-11-01 21:15:32__

> Wish it was available in my area.<br> :date: __2015-11-22 22:40:57__

> Do they take any insurance at all??<br> :date: __2015-08-17 01:35:28__

> This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...<br> :date: __2019-08-20 22:15:47__

> The app has not allowed me to select a date for appointments for two months. It freezes and I have to close the app entirely, then call anyway to make my appointments. The frustration compounds when appointments are cancelled and I have to repeat the process.<br> :date: __2019-07-18 03:08:25__

> Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the "schedule a service" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?<br> :date: __2018-12-05 18:14:31__

> The service is terrific but the app is no longer working well. I have to use the website rather than the app to schedule my appointments.<br> :date: __2018-09-23 18:26:18__

> Live in Walnut Creek. One side of the street has service, other side doesn't. Mind blown!<br> :date: __2018-01-13 20:25:11__

> I'm trying to use it because I am sick but it won't let me save any of my information on it on the profile everytime I hit the save button it just spins a circle like it saving but then if I go back out of it because it does nothing afterwards it just cleared everything out and nothing gets saved so I really never got to use the app at all<br> :date: __2017-09-12 18:56:17__

> App doesn't work.  Actually needed it last week and it failed.  Wound up going to the local urgent care instead.  Waste of time to even use it...<br> :date: __2017-04-27 20:41:02__

> The App only works from 8am to 8pm.<br> :date: __2015-07-02 08:10:07__

> Web shows 30.00 on site flu shots for the elderly, in this case my 89 year old mother.. Once you register its 79.00. Uninstalled app and will never use or recommend. Be honest and upfront.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 04:28:56__

> Horrible customer service ! Don't use<br> :date: __2020-07-31 19:01:30__

> Horrible Support Staff response time, poor house call system in app. The doctor I got was great, the app wasnt. Telemedicine call went quick and painless but when we tried to get a house call setup the appointment was cancelled day of. There was no email or indication as to why and I followed up with Heal through their chat and emailed them. The chat support told me they'd reschedule the appointment and never got back to me. The email got a response 14 hours later for followup emails.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 23:33:21__

> Needs to be available everywhere. I'm. In CT where it's bad.<br> :date: __2020-04-08 00:15:30__

> Just installed the app from play store, The app asks me to upgrade to the latest version which isn't available<br> :date: __2020-03-19 07:14:20__
