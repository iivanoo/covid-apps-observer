## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So far pretty good, but rough around the edges The "selfie video" to confirm my identity against my driver's license seems flaky, it took a few tries for me and my friend to be verified. Not sure what changed (also, "liveness" verified - do you mean "likeness"?)<br> :date: __2021-07-29 21:02:17__

> App is temperamental<br> :date: __2021-07-19 04:05:59__

> My wallet got stolen last week, but this app basically means i can still go do adult stuff.<br> :date: __2021-07-13 18:14:38__

> Not accepted everywhere yet ... CSP doesn't even & they're pay off CO govt.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 23:12:45__

> Ok, but unable to verify my ID info. Whenever I click confirm, it just takes me to a blank screen.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 22:09:56__

> I constantly have issues with the app recognizing my username and password. Resetting the password is quite a chore.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 04:24:49__

> Trouble with updating new 21 I.D.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 13:13:21__

> My only problem is why I have it is a lot of places don't consider it valid you know you can't use it to get your ID a lot of motels won't take it I couldn't even get little fireworks from King Soopers with it that's why I only complain about it and it's a legit Colorado government ID so I understand everything is going digital<br> :date: __2021-06-23 11:00:06__

> V id3 22nd f<br> :date: __2021-06-22 22:53:05__

> Clunky. Took multiple attempts to log in only for the app to fail multiple times. Could not find my recorda and told me to email. What's the point of an app that can't submit a request to the administrator within it.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 19:53:02__

> App won't accept username, and will not let me log in, even though username fits their parameters. Cannot rate the rest of the app, since it will not let me create an account.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 16:47:36__

> Log in tedious and time consuming waiting for confirmation codes in messages that don't auto enter.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 23:13:33__

> I was hoping to used the app as a digital fishing license, but evey time I try to use the video/photo verification the camera is way to dark that it barely picks up any light in the area unless it's natural light. There should be an alternative way to authenticate because now this app is completely useless for me.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 22:47:30__

> This app is hot trash. Very slow, had to authenticate 4+ times to just use this. At that point physical ID is preferable to this<br> :date: __2021-07-11 20:30:18__

> No screenshot? Need easier share.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 23:05:02__

> Waste of time. I've referred so many people to this app too. Then like a month ago useless. I can't open the insurance at all the app just closes. Stupid really. Why bother if I can't store everything in one place. UGH<br> :date: __2021-07-07 14:14:29__

> Doesn't show any current hunting/fishing licenses or Parks passes regardless of if they were purchased one day ago or 6 months ago<br> :date: __2021-06-28 04:54:39__

> Every time I attempt to get my insurance cards, the application crashes.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 04:06:00__

> This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with "certificate errors" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 06:47:57__



#### 1-star reviews

> Issues... mainly I'm unable to verify my identity. Everytime I select the option it just takes me to a blank white screen. Pretty annoying, but the app is a quality of life, not a necessity. It would just be nice if it worked like it was supposed to. Hopefully one day.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 18:56:28__

> Couldn't verify my id<br> :date: __2021-07-27 23:57:28__

> Doesn't work at all. When I try to create an account it says the system is down and I should try again later. I've tried to create an account on five different days and it still doesn't work. Taking a day off to go to the DMV is the only solution.<br> :date: __2021-07-27 00:25:22__

> Was fine until update... Trash devs... No link for "forgot password" This is what happens when you hire inexperienced programmers and pay trash money... YOU GET TRASH... SMH<br> :date: __2021-07-26 03:54:30__

> Need a id but take aid to get on a site.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 16:27:44__

> I verify myself then It just goes back to login screen<br> :date: __2021-07-23 10:54:40__

> Tried to create an account and it won't scan my license. I spent a solid 5 minutes trying to get it to scan (changed lighting, background, etc) and nothing. So it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 20:29:09__

> Difficult to get started, I've spent over 30 minutes trying to get it to accept my username or password in the initial setup. My username and password fit the required parameters, but it requires more than that for both username and password. Once I figured that out and got it working I now have a username I'll never remember and a password that I'm also probably going to forget. With how difficult this was to get started I wouldn't be shocked if I delete it during my next login attempt.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 20:29:27__

> Loses documents that have been uploaded, deactivates your account randomly without any notice, can't reset password, help desk support is incompetent.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 16:24:44__

> Waste of time. Doesn't scan the barcode, does not offer any help. I wouldn't even bother looking at it. Plus, the support team was absolutely no help.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 18:14:25__
