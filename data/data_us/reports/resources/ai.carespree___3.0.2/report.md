## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CareMarket Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.sydneycare.ai](https://www.sydneycare.ai) |
| **Email** | support@sydneycare.ai |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Seems buggy It worked fine for few days then stopped working. Reloaded changed password still getting era message.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 01:03:24__

> Quick and painless, although a little buggy. Sometimes it struggles to sign me in, and when I try to save a doctor's note it just crashes. Otherwise incredibly helpful, especially now.<br> :date: __2020-09-08 01:20:22__

> Nice way to obtain health concern with an MD :)<br> :date: __2020-06-12 20:01:23__

#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="3_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="ai.carespree 3 reviews"/>
</p>

> This would be better if the doctors were instantly available. There will be hours and hours of waiting and reconnecting and retrying and re-launching the app. I did get to meet with a doctor twice. Once they looked at me, and the next time they actually called in a prescription to my local pharmacy for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 17:31:05__

> Need to go to home page<br> :date: __2020-05-14 00:14:29__

> Haven't had it yet.<br> :date: __2020-04-30 09:01:44__

> I loved this app when it worked! Now it keeps crashing. Every time I open it, it freezes and nothing shows up. I tried to see if there was an update but there's not :(<br> :date: __2020-04-09 11:09:00__

> Impossible to use, this app crashes right when you get to the section that asks you questions. I've tried two different devices with the same result on each. Update, the related issue was fixed so I've updated my rating. This app still needs a better user experience, so 3 stars now.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:39:51__

> Doesn't recognize my symptoms to suggest correct treatment. Additionally you are only providing two genders. There should be an option for gender fluid and non binary and the respective pronouns.<br> :date: __2019-10-11 21:02:53__

#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="ai.carespree 1 reviews"/>
</p>

> Initial wait to speak with a doctor was 1 hour, which I honestly didn't mind considering the current world events. What really irritated me was the actual chat with the doctor. It took 3.5 hours mostly because the doctor took between 10-15 minutes to respond to me. I believe the longest I waited for him to respond was 30 minutes. On top of all that, I was told he wasn't currently able to provide a doctor's note due to current limitations within the app. Waste of money and time.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:56:02__

> Clunky, confusing setup process. There is a lot of configuration of personal settings even after connecting to the main Sydney health app and my Anthem account. Once you have it set, it still makes you go through the symptom checker before you can use its touted features for communicating with medical experts. Even that might be workable, but there are huge gaps in the symptom checker. I can't start with hypertension or high blood pressure as a symptom? Terrible, frustrating design.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:19:48__

> Think I have Covid but private healthcare is a fail. Horrible App (and somehow I pay for this experience). I have anthem blue cross blue shield and their sydney care app to figure out the covid testing I need with symptoms is a fail. Tries to link accounts but won't login and the reset password doesn't work to the email on file or phone. I can login to their other sydney app just fine. This sydney business has been a wreck since they sought to disconnect it from the name of the provider.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:54:25__

> It will not allow me to get any info over to my work. Will not allow me to download my doctor visit information to my phone or fax it to my work or email to my HR department.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:15:41__

> I have to answer the same questions every time I log in. It doesn't pick up where we left off.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 13:32:00__

> Dumb app does not work!! You can not get passed the login!<br> :date: __2020-09-07 02:37:52__

> App crashes more than all Nascar drivers together. Cant even download an attachment referral. Also have to sign in 8 times just to send one message because it crashes then requires login credentials. Fought with this app for 60 min before I told the doctor to just cancel everything we discussed and I was uninstalling this piece of trash crash app.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 18:39:31__

> Dont download. Cant put in code to register<br> :date: __2020-08-29 17:27:15__

> Keeps going back to main menu, no matter if I try to link it and login with my Sydney health info or try making a new account. There is no in-app chat or trouble shooting. Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this"resource" multiple times. I have a doctorate, and my husband literally writes computer code for a living so this is not user error. If he and I can't figure out how to make it work, it just doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 16:03:30__

> This app sucks I can't even log in...I enter a password and it says my password cannot be my username or part of my username or email even though my password is not!<br> :date: __2020-08-01 01:54:54__
