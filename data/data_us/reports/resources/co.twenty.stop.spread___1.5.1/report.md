## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Recent update broke ability to view results because date of birth can't be changed from year 2001. Will revise review when fixed. Update: the developers instruction does fix the DOB entry problem but it really should not be so complicated. The previous DOB interface was frustrating as well but it did work. Not sure why it is so complicated. Upgrading to three stars as most people still won't be able to figure out the DOB trick.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 17:08:49__
