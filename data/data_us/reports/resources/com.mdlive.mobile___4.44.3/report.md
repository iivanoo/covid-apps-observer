In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's easy and time manageable.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 13:44:37__

> This was a good program. The Doctor I saw was very nice and knowledgeable. The app worked good as well, sound skipped once or twice when a reminder popped up, but didn't cause any major concern. I am happy with this overall so far.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 21:54:40__

> My therapist really cared and gave me things to think about. Shes easy to talk to,, and open up to.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 15:51:13__

> It does doesn't have an option to switch time zones and it didn't transfer the permissions properly when I got a new phone which left it saying that it couldn't load instead of telling me to check my permissions. It works<br> :date: __2021-04-13 23:42:25__

> Too easy to visit the doctor in between emails at work (for the record, it's work from home). No ads so the ad question on app survey irrelevant.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 21:23:09__

> Super nice Doctors.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 22:47:26__

> The ability to talk to someone without leaving home is amazing, especially when you have anxiety. The quality of the video was good. I just wish that there is a simple way to upload documents. Also the Dropbox for issues needs to be updated to have all all illnesses and mental health listed.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 15:01:25__

> Very pleased with the therapist<br> :date: __2021-04-01 02:52:17__

#### 3-star reviews

> Awesome service. Scheduling is difficult. It is hard to view a providers available slots, you only see availability for the specific date you've chosen. It would be easier to see all available time slot options for the week or month. There's no online waiting room so if your provider is late it feels like you aren't logging in correctly or experiencing technical difficulties.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 01:07:11__

> Some glitches registering until I happened to glance at email. If the app told me to confirm my new account by responding to an email, I missed it.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 22:34:15__

> Very buggy and times out often. When I want to make an appointment, I have to expect to go through the forms at least twice. It will load so long that it tells me to log in again. I just used the urgent care and it glitched where I saw a still image of myself where I should see the doctor, and then my little camera box. It was very awkward, but at least the appointment achieved what I needed.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 18:49:22__

> It's better than most other than apps<br> :date: __2021-03-15 16:21:15__

> Medical phone up to, "... $82, $108," insurance is payment. See app pre explanations. Not a patient.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 22:43:21__

> Hard to navigate.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:33:04__

> My pricing page changes amounts all the time, some days it's $0 then the next it's $82, surge pricing?<br> :date: __2021-02-18 19:36:50__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-09 00:49:39__

> It's my fault for not going to the end of this month for the next few days so I can get the car running a little bit late but I am going to try y<br> :date: __2020-12-25 00:13:06__

> The app glitches a lot<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:14:22__

> I actually like my therapist and it's nice being able to sometimes schedule an appointment quickly, but I wouldn't use this app for anything other than mental health. The times I've contacted customer service, they were rude and not helpful at all. They pretty much said, "too bad" to my technical difficulties. The app is very buggy and it can be incredibly stressful to schedule appointments because of this. They're online website isn't any better. They're lucky I like my therapist so much.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 04:38:16__

> Would like to meet and talk to a primary care doctor for my special needs having problem at University Hospital I thought I was getting some problems take care of her surgery<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:49:11__

> It's okay it does the job but with the app I cannot use any type of earphones, whether wired or wireless ones.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 19:03:41__

> Don't waste your time ..only a dozen drs take this with in 50 Mile radius<br> :date: __2021-04-16 14:55:10__

> After reading the horrible ANXIETY PRODUCING reviews, and knowing I experienced similar issues with another Dr appt.. for several DAYS. And now I see many apps tend to not be connecting ..I'm uninstalling this as I DON'T appreciate the treatment by Drs who charge ppl due to the failed technology. Period. Ethically and morally wrong.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 07:44:04__

> I downloaded this app based on my employers advice because it's supposed to be a free service for us. I've had nothing but issues. The registration process was not simple and I was told I had to pay $82 for a consultation. I called and spent 30 mins on the phone with someone who told me that was a glitch and she gave me a credit. Today I'm told via email I'm not covered and I owe $82. This is not convenient and poor customer service.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:26:02__

> Bug preventing use<br> :date: __2021-01-13 23:01:26__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> I thought it was free<br> :date: __2021-04-28 06:35:02__

> Why are you asking questions about insurance? Other med apps are free!<br> :date: __2021-04-27 03:38:26__

> I tried to see a doctor.... Because I didn't have any insurance and they wanted to diagnose me with covid... They keep kicking me out of the system.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 20:16:06__

> Not used<br> :date: __2021-04-19 05:04:40__

> Just signed up bc having mania for several days. Looking through therapist and they all play classic guitar and enjoying making Italian food with family! Not impressed. This is supposed to help ppl. What a joke!<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:04:20__

> Worst experience with an app. Only downloaded it because their junk website kept crashing and giving errors. The app does the same. Absolutely infuriating when you're sick and just trying to get an appointment going. Garbage.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 02:43:20__

> This is a ripoff. They literally just take money from you without even trying to help. This is a freaking joke. I want my money back<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:46:49__

> A Warning: This app is a scam. The doctor the app paired me with took my $40 co-pay and in the middle of me telling her my symptoms cut me off and told me she wasn't comfortable treating a mild case of nausea. All I wanted was for her to prescribe something to counter the nausea. This "doctor" had already decided before I ever spoke to her that she wasn't going to treat me. She said she absolutely refused to treat me. Just a warning. They will take your money but they may refuse to treat you.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 22:11:00__

> I'm uninstalling this app. The doctors on here treat me suspiciously most of the time and tell me to suck it up and deal. Then I still get charge the same for receiving no help at all. The therapy on here is a joke, too. Horrible app. Find a different one if you can.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 16:43:48__

> Had to restset damn password several times. Link will take to site to change password and once you change damn app still say invalid. Plus never can get a person on phone. I am in pain and will just take my chances at ER. Plus no area to key in your insurance information<br> :date: __2021-04-03 20:06:43__
