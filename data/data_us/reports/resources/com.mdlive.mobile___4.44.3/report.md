## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very good experience with this app. I only knocked off a star because the first appointment was through video and it didn't connect. I have 5G so I knew i had a pretty good connection. It may have been something else but other than that it was as good as in person but with everything going on its even safer.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 21:00:45__

> I downloaded this app based on my employers advice because it's supposed to be a free service for us. I've had nothing but issues. The registration process was not simple and I was told I had to pay $82 for a consultation. I called and spent 30 mins on the phone with someone who told me that was a glitch and she gave me a credit. Today I'm told via email I'm not covered and I owe $82. This is not convenient and poor customer service.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:26:02__

> Bug preventing use<br> :date: __2021-01-13 23:01:26__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> The app works, but is frustrating. It continually says I have a message waiting but there is no message to read. I made an appointment, PAID, and then doctor never showed. So now what? I paid and got no service.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:22:16__

> Great experience, would definitely use again. It was convenient and very easy to use. Update: Used again and was extremely disappointed. The doctor never looked and my pictures that I had sent. Also I wanted a video call, instead the doctor called me on the phone, he was driving and like I said he never looked at my pictures because he asked me to describe my rash. Without looking at my pictures he went ahead and diagnosed me even after I told him I already had the prescription he prescribed it<br> :date: __2020-12-01 17:20:58__

> It keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:47:38__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> The doctors are all super condescending, and not able to discuss medication or anything meaningful, primary care doctor practically refused to talk to me without having lab results. Also, there's no way to get an appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist because they are by request only, and they decline the request without even giving a reason. I would literally never use this app if social distancing was over.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 22:25:27__

> the worst - total frauds. 2 appointments both fails. Tried to log on repeatedly and the app failed to work. I was told I was a "no show" even thoughI have records of repeated attempts of trying to log in. The app doesnt work, the tech support nonexistant, and the doctors uncaring, callus, and unreliable. \*\**NO I will not give these low lifes more information! I will not give them another chance to suck the life outa me. I spent hours trying to work them already. Their asking is just gaslighting<br> :date: __2021-03-11 10:46:49__

> Can't get into the app. Says can't connect.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 20:28:17__

> App was updated Mar. 2, now I can't login. "Unable to load needed services. Application will now exit"<br> :date: __2021-03-06 22:15:49__

> What a horrible ripoff. I will never use this app ever again.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 05:36:32__

> I'm trying to find a surgeon for colon and everytime the password is entered CORRECTLY using this app, it locks me out of the entire system. This application AND THE WEBSITE. I'm forced to reset my password at the website everytime. I've called customer service. Only helped me reset my password... Now I suffer because of a pandemic lock out.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 03:29:18__

> Once you select your appointment type the screen will not move forward the next button does not respond.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 19:52:05__

> Unable to create login. When I attempt to create an account it erases my login info so I'm not even able to create an account at all. This is the app that is supposed to be part of my Behavior Health telehealth benefits. Very frustrating when I need mental health support & can't get it!!<br> :date: __2021-02-21 09:10:16__

> Worse app we have ever used. Very frustrating and not easy to use. This app is built to just not go anywhere if you don't pick what they want. If you just pick anything that is not related just to move forward you then get a message that your session has expired. Just go see Dr in person. This app isn't worth your frustration<br> :date: __2021-02-20 04:17:23__

> Says I'm already registered. No recovery options besides email. Sent help request here, and my message was blocked. Completely inaccessible.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 05:47:07__
