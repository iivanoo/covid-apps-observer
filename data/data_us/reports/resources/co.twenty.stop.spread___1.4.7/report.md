## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | info@healthytogether.io |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Everything went smoothly. Results were back in a timely manner. The app was easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 13:51:03__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:16:06__

> Good app, easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 17:40:38__

> I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:23:43__

> Works well! Allows me to view my workplace Covid-19 test results in this app!<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:11:00__

> It is a good app, easy to use. My only complaint is that after I fill out my school's passport, it still notifies me to complete a healthy together survey every day. I wish the passport counted for both.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 15:40:38__

> I think this is a great idea. Hopefully people will continue to download it. I do wish it was easier to figure out how to schedule tests.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 19:14:09__

> Doesn't drain battery badly. I think the question "Have you been tested for Covid19?", should say "Have you been tested for covud 19 in the last 20 days?" Notification for test results come back quicker than my doctor can contact me.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 16:00:57__

> Great app and I have invited everyone in my contacts due to the high necessity to know how healthy the people you surround yourself with. The even better part about this app is the fact that if you allow it to trace you (and you should), it can tell you about other users being sick or testing positive if you've been around them and you don't even have to know the person! I would, however, like it a lot more (or give it 5 stars), if it would update the map of testing areas. A lot missing.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 23:00:50__

> It seems to work really well now.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 19:24:06__

> Can't even login. Had a pin texted to me. I typed the numbers but there is no button to press for enter and the "next" function just moves the cursor around. Edited to add: could not make app work on Samsung Galaxy S10 but it did work on older S7.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:12:08__

> App was incredibly slow to download and install. I have a galaxy 7 and no issues with other apps. My wireless is in the 26M area. Just left the install to the next day. Opened properly on the second try. From there all good. Put in info, got code, got date screen and results. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-01 23:45:56__

> Just got a text saying my results are ready open app and said not found explain please<br> :date: __2020-11-27 17:24:44__

> Should show all results<br> :date: __2020-11-25 13:52:14__

> Why isn't this app integrated with Google and Apple's covid exposure notification system? Please add support for that.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:53:41__

> Wish the app would send notices for the number of cases in the county at a scheduled time not just a map.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 22:07:45__

> You need to add an option to state nothing has changed since last assessment so you can quickly provide answers. You could even have it show up in the notification as a response. It would really make it much better.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 18:38:18__

> Too wordy for daily use...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 06:38:47__

> Not happy with the app<br> :date: __2020-08-09 17:42:37__

> I want to know where the information goes? Who checks this? Department of health? Or who?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 13:41:27__

> Can't seem to get back in after the initial upload and sign in.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 01:50:11__

> App says installed in Google Play Store, but cannot find the app on my phone. Have Motorola Moto G7 and app store says my phone is compatible with the app. Have no issues installing and running other apps.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:20:47__

> Haven't seen any information relevant to my personal information yet.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 16:58:40__

> Pretty useless. Tells me to quarantine just because I live with someone who's tested positive regardless of how long ago that was.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 09:35:27__

> This app tells you to get tested for COVID if you have one symptom. Sometimes people have body aches because they did a hard work out. Sometimes people get a sore throat because they are too much sugar. There are other reasons to have some of these symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 22:17:10__

> Does not show the areas of covid on map. Shows absolutely nothing on the map.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 18:37:29__

> I suppose i don't hate it for its functionality. But i do hate how I'm forced to use it, and every time I work out it says i need to get tested because I'm sore and I have to show these results to employers/professors.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 17:56:32__

> Digital contact tracing turned off? This is the apps main feature. I can find mom way to turn it back on. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-08-29 15:34:43__

> The app has killed my battery. It seems like it could be useful, but an app on a dead phone can only do so much.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 23:11:19__

> It's Draining my battery at 45% usage over my other apps and I only use it briefly for one moment of the day. Plus the state of utah isn't using the tracking feature. Please update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 14:47:28__
