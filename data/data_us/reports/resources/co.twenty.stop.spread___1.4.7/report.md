## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | info@healthytogether.io |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:46:54__

> I had to attempt it twice before i was successful. I think i was in a hurry and stressed to get the results.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:25:58__

> Useless impossible to navigate<br> :date: __2020-12-06 13:49:19__

> Everything went smoothly. Results were back in a timely manner. The app was easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 13:51:03__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:16:06__

> Good app, easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 17:40:38__

> I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:23:43__

> Works well! Allows me to view my workplace Covid-19 test results in this app!<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:11:00__

> It is a good app, easy to use. My only complaint is that after I fill out my school's passport, it still notifies me to complete a healthy together survey every day. I wish the passport counted for both.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 15:40:38__

> I think this is a great idea. Hopefully people will continue to download it. I do wish it was easier to figure out how to schedule tests.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 19:14:09__

> Very slow install but got results after a while.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 17:58:45__

> They ask for a pin but do not send one.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 16:33:59__

> Can't even login. Had a pin texted to me. I typed the numbers but there is no button to press for enter and the "next" function just moves the cursor around. Edited to add: could not make app work on Samsung Galaxy S10 but it did work on older S7.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:12:08__

> App was incredibly slow to download and install. I have a galaxy 7 and no issues with other apps. My wireless is in the 26M area. Just left the install to the next day. Opened properly on the second try. From there all good. Put in info, got code, got date screen and results. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-01 23:45:56__

> Just got a text saying my results are ready open app and said not found explain please<br> :date: __2020-11-27 17:24:44__

> Should show all results<br> :date: __2020-11-25 13:52:14__

> Why isn't this app integrated with Google and Apple's covid exposure notification system? Please add support for that.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:53:41__

> Wish the app would send notices for the number of cases in the county at a scheduled time not just a map.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 22:07:45__

> You need to add an option to state nothing has changed since last assessment so you can quickly provide answers. You could even have it show up in the notification as a response. It would really make it much better.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 18:38:18__

> Too wordy for daily use...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 06:38:47__

> I went and got my children and myself tested. The app stated that the results were ready for us all however, I'm trying to get the results for my oldest child, however it's not providing me results when the contact information is the same for all three individuals. Can someone please assist me in getting the information for my eldest child. Updated: The provider has the correct information and it was entered correctly, yet the results are still not showing for the my entire family.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:50:22__

> Very slow to down load. Does not ask if your a spouse. Keeps saying not connect. The time took 1 hour.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:38:01__

> Endless loop, I keep signing in (4 times so far) and it keeps saying it will be installed. Pretty useless. And I can't get the results of my covid19 test.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 13:55:23__

> Pretty useless. Tells me to quarantine just because I live with someone who's tested positive regardless of how long ago that was.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 09:35:27__

> This app tells you to get tested for COVID if you have one symptom. Sometimes people have body aches because they did a hard work out. Sometimes people get a sore throat because they are too much sugar. There are other reasons to have some of these symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 22:17:10__
