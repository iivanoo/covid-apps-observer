## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A ways to go but a great start. The login process could be smoother, takes a bit to get in so log in before you need it. The image is a bit stretched in the app vs your id card. Lastly, I wish they did more education to businesses so they understand this is a legal version of identification.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 05:06:04__

> *update* changed review from 1 to 4 stars. After failed attempts to load, contacted support team and it loaded perfectly. Not convenient that, but yes loaded. Has worked great since. Used ID to get fishing license no prob. Used for other times no prob In state. Not used a lot, but nice when I have.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 15:59:26__

> This app saved my life but now it keep saying retry otp and now I can't use it for my I'd. How I'm supposed to buy my essential things with no I'd!<br> :date: __2020-09-25 20:54:47__

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> Only after 10 attempts (using my new DL that just arrived in the mail earlier that day) was it able to register my driver's liscence in the virtual wallet. Other than taking forever to scan my documents, the app is pretty darn good.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 04:06:34__

> Everything was bool, then my picture didnt show up<br> :date: __2020-07-22 03:08:11__

> Drivers license does not show all the license it cuts off not able to see entire number cannot retake picture of new license that i renewed other parts of the app work great<br> :date: __2020-07-13 16:56:19__

> Had to use my sister's phone to scan my I.D., for whatever reason, my phone wouldn't scan, but other than that, I like this app..<br> :date: __2020-06-01 02:31:47__

> It ok needs improvement on application<br> :date: __2020-05-08 05:29:35__

> I am giving some stars based on the potential for being walletless. Using this in lieu of my driver's license would be game changing. I am taking off the same number of stars because I can't do this yet.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 03:17:40__

> Unable to add digital ID due to a camera malfunction during the verification. Will rate again when issue is fixed.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:02:10__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Everything I upload the front side of my ID it kicks me out and makes me login in again??<br> :date: __2020-09-08 00:43:05__

> Frustrating. Trying to help roommate update his state id. Got to taking pics of id but then it would ask to log in after taking pic of back id. Multiple times. Hes mentally disabled and gets so frustrated that he almost punched a hole through a door window... he has little patience and gets so frustrated easily with almost anything.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 16:55:34__

> Need more documents<br> :date: __2020-05-26 17:43:27__

> 5/17/2020 I came back to the app to see if any functional utility was turned on. Instead all it does is open the website for each issue. I thought this app would provide a list of my vehicles and what the registration status is. How about selecting a vehicle to order a copy of title? I uploaded my license as proof of identity, why?<br> :date: __2020-05-18 00:48:27__

> I'm STILL not sure what the actual use of this is. when i added my ID it said it's not a replacement for the physical ID. also it's been easier to just pull out my ID than login again. at least the one time i was gonna use it i just gave up because i didn't have time to go through the verification process every time.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 23:55:02__

> Sweet, I need a registration renewal and everything is closed. So I see on Nextdoor about this app. But I can't use it - why? I have a 2 yr old $150 Lenovo Phab which won't allow this app. So I need to buy a new phone to use - great. Not everyone can afford a new phone every year especially Seniors. The emissions places are closed as are the DL locations so I guess I just drive with an expired tag.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 20:23:52__

> This app is ridiculous. I keep installing it over and over and over and over again and restarting my phone over and over and over and over again and everytime I try to scan my ID the app crashes. This is beyond frustrating I don't see why I can't just physically enter in my information this is so stupid.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 00:50:17__

> Wont download<br> :date: __2020-12-23 06:08:34__

> Freezes the phone and crashes every time it tries to get a face map after log in. I still have yet to actually USE the app, so bye-bye<br> :date: __2020-12-20 15:54:45__

> I just got my temporary paper ID the app will not allow me to scan it so I cant make an account. This is not cool waste of space on my device.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:28:10__

> This app is a good idea which is not ready for Prime Time. The app is hard to get set up. One can create an account, but then one needs the "Authentication" number which is supposedly emailed. I found that less than 10% of the time did I actually get an email. OK, fine, I eventually got one that worked, and got logged on. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU GET LOGGED OFF, YOU YOU NEED ANOTHER "AUTHENTICATION" EMAIL TO GET LOGGED ON AGAIN, AND THEY MOSTLY DON'T ARRIVE. In addition, this app is supposed to be able to be used on the roadside to touchlessly give one's info to a law enforcement officer. If the emails don't reliable arrive to a home with a fast wired connection, think what problems would arise on the side of a remote road somewhere in rural Colorado. And imagine telling a State Trooper "just a minute, I'm waiting for the email." As long as the app requires an unreliable "Authentication" I certainly can't recommend it. Shouldn't authenticating once be enough? ADDENDUM: A comment on this review from the State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT asked me to contact their tech support. I had previously done that - they said: "When you created your account, Ping ID is used to pair your device. I am reaching out to our developers to confirm what email address is connected to your account. As soon as I have more information I will reach back out and let you know!" After 12 days I have heard nothing. I contacted them again, with a copy of this review, and we'll see if they do anything this time. I know things are weird in this country right now, so I'm willing to patiently wait and see what happens. I'd really like them to address the issue of whether one actually has to do the "Authentication" every time one logs into the app, or if that's an error of some sort. Maybe they could comment on that here?<br> :date: __2020-12-14 23:46:26__

> Looks like it would be a great app, if it worked. . . App crashes every time I scan the back of my license. I tried restarting the phone, not having any other apps in use, no luck.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 19:20:12__

> ID scanner is hot garbage, can't create account<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:51:33__

> Try and do the facial recognition blacks out my camera, if you wanted to steal ppls info in Colorado just ask don't make an app that doesnt even work. Disgraceful!!! Your not even trying to improve Coloradan lives at all, just trying to line each other pockets while we continue to suffer. Pathetic!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:40:36__

> Took me literally 16 tries and a waste of 30 minutes of frustration just for it to recognize my face in a brightly light room for my id. Absolutely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:19:49__

> Businesses in Colorado are refused to accept digital ID. What is the point to have a digital ID? Website said "Colorado Digital ID may be accepted as a legal form of personal identification for use in Colorado". Keyword here is "may" instead of "shall". Business don't have to accept it if they are wish not to.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 01:09:50__
