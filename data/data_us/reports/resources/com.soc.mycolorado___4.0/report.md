## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app!<br> :date: __2020-12-04 19:15:39__

> It is easy to get your ID up. Other then that not sure.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 19:23:28__

> Not too bad to set up. Maybe an address change I submitted will take, since the app didn't recognize one from April. Have to see how useful it is, since I am old enough I don't need id in bars and restaurants. Selfie was the most difficult part.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 23:45:05__

> Umm finally, they have all the information anyway we may as well benefit from it somehow.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 15:36:17__

> Straight forward and super easy to use. Add this to the list of why Colorado is awesome✌️<br> :date: __2020-12-02 07:44:03__

> Cool big brother at work.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 05:03:00__

> I'm new to the app & will leave a more detailed review at a later date. Just wanted to point out to the person who posted recently & the developers: the app isn't the cause of your old address showing up when scanned, the state's records are. I went through the process of updating my address online last year. Any time I've rented a car since then, my license pulls my old address. If a trooper scanned your card, I'd assume the same would happen, so the digital ID is no more disadvantegous.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:25:15__

> Nice to know that the digital version is accepted. Makes the app more worthwhile.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:22:17__

> Easy acces to my ID at all times<br> :date: __2020-11-25 16:13:02__

> I was able to use digital ID immediately.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 03:29:59__

> Tricky to get set up but after that works like a charm<br> :date: __2020-12-02 23:26:24__

> Had a couple issues trying to figure out what to do at first, but I figured it out.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 23:17:23__

> Only 4 stars because the facial recognition camera is to sensative<br> :date: __2020-11-17 00:30:02__

> A ways to go but a great start. The login process could be smoother, takes a bit to get in so log in before you need it. The image is a bit stretched in the app vs your id card. Lastly, I wish they did more education to businesses so they understand this is a legal version of identification.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 05:06:04__

> *update* changed review from 1 to 4 stars. After failed attempts to load, contacted support team and it loaded perfectly. Not convenient that, but yes loaded. Has worked great since. Used ID to get fishing license no prob. Used for other times no prob In state. Not used a lot, but nice when I have.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 15:59:26__

> Works well, wish it had more resource information available<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:19:38__

> Love the digital ID. More business need to accept it.<br> :date: __2020-09-19 23:54:56__

> When trying to view my entered insurance info the app crashes<br> :date: __2020-08-31 19:22:38__

> Everything is good but the app need to change to color of text from white to black for easier to read.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 10:27:57__

> Previous certificate issue has now been fixed. App functions as expected now<br> :date: __2020-07-16 23:08:23__

> This app saved my life but now it keep saying retry otp and now I can't use it for my I'd. How I'm supposed to buy my essential things with no I'd!<br> :date: __2020-09-25 20:54:47__

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> Only after 10 attempts (using my new DL that just arrived in the mail earlier that day) was it able to register my driver's liscence in the virtual wallet. Other than taking forever to scan my documents, the app is pretty darn good.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 04:06:34__

> Everything was bool, then my picture didnt show up<br> :date: __2020-07-22 03:08:11__

> Drivers license does not show all the license it cuts off not able to see entire number cannot retake picture of new license that i renewed other parts of the app work great<br> :date: __2020-07-13 16:56:19__

> Had to use my sister's phone to scan my I.D., for whatever reason, my phone wouldn't scan, but other than that, I like this app..<br> :date: __2020-06-01 02:31:47__

> It ok needs improvement on application<br> :date: __2020-05-08 05:29:35__

> I am giving some stars based on the potential for being walletless. Using this in lieu of my driver's license would be game changing. I am taking off the same number of stars because I can't do this yet.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 03:17:40__

> The password change is difficult. You can barely see reset button after you validate account. it gives an error message that appears to say it was not successful and to contact admin but the Pw change is successful. You can log in with new password<br> :date: __2020-04-30 14:06:42__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Everything I upload the front side of my ID it kicks me out and makes me login in again??<br> :date: __2020-09-08 00:43:05__

> Frustrating. Trying to help roommate update his state id. Got to taking pics of id but then it would ask to log in after taking pic of back id. Multiple times. Hes mentally disabled and gets so frustrated that he almost punched a hole through a door window... he has little patience and gets so frustrated easily with almost anything.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 16:55:34__

> Need more documents<br> :date: __2020-05-26 17:43:27__

> 5/17/2020 I came back to the app to see if any functional utility was turned on. Instead all it does is open the website for each issue. I thought this app would provide a list of my vehicles and what the registration status is. How about selecting a vehicle to order a copy of title? I uploaded my license as proof of identity, why?<br> :date: __2020-05-18 00:48:27__

> I'm STILL not sure what the actual use of this is. when i added my ID it said it's not a replacement for the physical ID. also it's been easier to just pull out my ID than login again. at least the one time i was gonna use it i just gave up because i didn't have time to go through the verification process every time.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 23:55:02__

> Sweet, I need a registration renewal and everything is closed. So I see on Nextdoor about this app. But I can't use it - why? I have a 2 yr old $150 Lenovo Phab which won't allow this app. So I need to buy a new phone to use - great. Not everyone can afford a new phone every year especially Seniors. The emissions places are closed as are the DL locations so I guess I just drive with an expired tag.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 20:23:52__

> I dont like the registration processes seems like a traker, n I dont trust it.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 03:11:37__

> Try and do the facial recognition blacks out my camera, if you wanted to steal ppls info in Colorado just ask don't make an app that doesnt even work. Disgraceful!!! Your not even trying to improve Coloradan lives at all, just trying to line each other pockets while we continue to suffer. Pathetic!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:40:36__

> Took me literally 16 tries and a waste of 30 minutes of frustration just for it to recognize my face in a brightly light room for my id. Absolutely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:19:49__

> Businesses in Colorado are refused to accept digital ID. What is the point to have a digital ID? Website said "Colorado Digital ID may be accepted as a legal form of personal identification for use in Colorado". Keyword here is "may" instead of "shall". Business don't have to accept it if they are wish not to.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 01:09:50__

> My digital I'd image shows big O Stamp showing restrictions of my license over it...theirs no need to show all that<br> :date: __2020-10-17 15:48:55__

> Horrible app, camera functions are a joke, system is always down<br> :date: __2020-10-16 17:06:13__

> Its broken wont take a picture no matter what wasted a half hour typical of this state<br> :date: __2020-10-11 22:43:31__

> Would not recognize username nor password. App doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 21:57:14__

> Each time I try to do the facial verification, the image uploads very blurry and it's definitely not my camera....<br> :date: __2020-10-09 21:10:26__

> What a pain<br> :date: __2020-10-09 03:32:20__

> Very bad ID function, doesn't work at all. Keep your business off this malfunctioning dumpster fire of an app if you can<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:03:59__
