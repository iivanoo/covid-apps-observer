### Description
> iBlueButton has been designed by physicians to allow you to have in your hands at all times your detailed medical history, enriched with personalized medical care guidance and important health safety warnings including risk factors for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). iBlueButton helps better manage your healthcare, prevent medical errors, and avoid costly unnecessary care all from the privacy and security of your device. Data is stored directly on your device, it is never shared or sold for any purpose. 
<br>iBlueButton won multiple awards over the years including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button program. iBlueButton is the first Medicare approved native mobile Blue Button application, and you can find the app listed on the Medicare.gov website (go to Manage Your Health). As a partner of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) since 2011, iBlueButton is also approved by the VA to allow Veterans to download their VA health record and assemble it into an interactive Summary Record, including graphic display of lab results & vital signs.
<br>iBlueButton can also retrieve TRICARE Blue Button records, allowing Military and their families to assemble all of their records into an enriched Summary Record.
<br>For Medicare beneficiaries & their caregivers, iBlueButton lets them login into their MyMedicare.gov account to retrieve their medical claim history which is then automatically translated into an organized medical history.
<br>Benefits of iBlueButton:
<br>- BE PREPARED WITH YOUR CRITICAL INFORMATION ALWAYS WITH YOU
<br>At the physicianâ€™s office or in the emergency room, be prepared with all the information you need securely organized and stored by iBlueButton on your smartphone or tablet. iBlueButton pulls and organizes your health records into easy to view sections. Your medical history is available for you at all times to review, research, understand medical terminology, annotate, and select the specific information you want to share.
<br>- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS
<br>iBlueButton automatically generates important safety warnings about your medications to help you prevent adverse drug effects, alerting you about highly addictive opioids and of potentially dangerous drug-drug interactions, or medications which should be avoided if you are over the age of 65. iBlueButton also provides professionally recommended medical care guidelines for common chronic conditions and now generates warnings and prevention alerts for individuals at risk for severe illness due to certain infectious diseases with access to CDC prevention guidance. 
<br>- LIFE AND COST SAVING
<br>On average, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians a year, with most physicians not having the full medical history of their patients, which can cause medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place in both VA and private-sector facilities. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.
<br>- SECURE AND PRIVATE, UNDER YOUR CONTROL
<br>Unlike most personal health applications, your information is only stored securely on your device, under your control, not in the cloud. Your data remains yours, with no risk of tampering or hacking and is never shared or sold.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Humetrix, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ibluebutton.com/](http://www.ibluebutton.com/) |
| **Email** | ibb.support@humetrix.com |
| **Physical address**  | [1310 Camino Del Mar, Suite C Del Mar, CA 92014](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1310%20Camino%20Del%20Mar,%20Suite%20C%20Del%20Mar,%20CA%2092014) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 20:03:58__

> Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:31:01__

> My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 00:29:47__

> Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at "higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:33:49__

> I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:29:37__

> Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:14:19__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2019-10-15 01:10:34__

> Great app to organize your medical information found on the Medicare website in Manage your Health.<br> :date: __2019-10-04 21:19:10__

> After using iBlueButton for a couple of months I noticed it was not updating my information.  The Humetrix support team was friendly, responsive, and pro-active in addressing the issues I had with the app.  As I reported issues they fixed them promptly and genuinely seemed to appreciate my input.  IBlueButton is a useful app with the best customer support I've seen in years.<br> :date: __2019-09-28 00:31:00__

> Using this app I found not one but two pretty huge errors in the information a doctor provided to Medicare, including a medication condition I never had. Recommend.<br> :date: __2019-09-24 18:09:46__

</p>

> A QUICK and EASY Document review system for multiplatform Care Providers. My only link is : " My Health e Vet " and it allows Documented & Statistical Data Review without need to allow entry to my actual secure site. A very pleasingly designed Medical Portal Software Device.<br> :date: __2015-12-31 06:51:01__

> Concept is awesome. Needs work<br> :date: __2015-02-17 17:13:42__

> Tried it since it was updated just yesterday (wanting to stay away from old junk). It won't retain the portal information, at least for VA.  I'd put it on and save but it would erase it and all again.  I used the same info to log on to actual site with no problems.  Maybe VA has changed their portal access or something.  I am a MHV coordinator so I'd love for this to work.  Update...working perfect now!<br> :date: __2014-07-22 20:47:53__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Still not sure but the concept is a good idea. I will try it first<br> :date: __2018-07-18 14:23:21__

> Not impressed, and for those of you that think that it's an official VA app...IT'S NOT. For security reasons, they still haven't come out with one. Until they do, this is all we have.<br> :date: __2017-10-25 11:39:17__

> The VA app is still in beta. (I know, because I'm in the beta.) Currently only VA employees can access the beta. All I can say is, it's still clunky, like most other apps I've looked at.<br> :date: __2016-11-21 20:23:02__

> Won't access tricareonline.  Unable to contact support as they filter all of those emails.<br> :date: __2016-05-13 00:32:29__

> Supposed to link to my VA page or from my VA page to the app bit doesn't. Have to manually get files/feeds but deletes previous downloaded items.<br> :date: __2015-06-18 05:46:14__

> When entering the password to protect info in the app it does a force close crash on my samsung galaxy exhibit running android  4.1.  After doing some program diagnostics the crash was the result of a  conflict with my swiping keyboard app called swype keyboard. The keyboard app causes the force close crash.<br> :date: __2015-01-19 06:34:09__

> This app seems to work fine as far as downloading my VA medical records. However, it doesn't save any info; neither reports I've just downloaded nor my personal info I just input. If I try to add my personal info from my card, the app crashes consistently.<br> :date: __2014-11-17 16:53:43__



#### 2-star reviews

> Sounds like it would be a good app but not able to get past logg in page. Tried uninstall and reinstall but still nothing. Ugh.<br> :date: __2018-08-21 11:55:40__

> I have downloaded and installed this app 5 times and not once have I gotten past the initial password screen. This needs to be diagnosed and  fixed. Other wise it is a pointless time investment. I am a frequent and happy user of the my healthevet application on the web. Having your health records available when you see your doctor (while maybe not essential, it is terribly convenient). we<br> :date: __2017-06-24 18:50:34__

> Great Big Fizzle on VA performance.<br> :date: __2016-04-09 02:02:09__

> Worked fine before now after I paid to get unlimited downloads it just keeps me at the loading screen.<br> :date: __2015-04-12 13:55:58__

> I've uninstall and reinstalled 2x. Unable to email record to anyone. Please fix or tell me how to fix it.<br> :date: __2014-06-29 07:28:24__

> It's a bit of work to set up. If you have an account with the VA or SSA, once you enter & verify who you are, the info should just populate itself; not hand enter everything. There's a memo pad app for that.<br> :date: __2014-03-02 06:34:16__

> I applaud the VA for launching the entire Blue Button Program.   The App is rather inmature and Will take a lot of sweat equity to bring it up to professional standards.   During my first use the App crashed entirely too much.<br> :date: __2013-06-15 05:23:08__

> App won't even open anymore. Just says some error code and that there is a problem with the server. What is the deal!<br> :date: __2020-01-08 07:37:04__

> This was a total waste of my time. It ask for dates for things in your childhood that no one would ever remember to add it. It also does not have all the medications that I am taking. What is the deal of listing pharmaceutical companies for meds when people go to stores to get meds? Why not just list the med. This is a useless app and a Big waste of time.<br> :date: __2019-09-16 23:45:07__

> crashes more often than anything. With the new upgrades this app is unusable. Can I get a rollback?<br> :date: __2019-01-14 17:32:18__
