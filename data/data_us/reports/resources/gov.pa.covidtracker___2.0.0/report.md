### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children
<br>under the age of 13.,
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Not what I expected, not the kind of information I was looking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 08:04:10__

> Now that there's a vaccine why don't you show where there's a vaccine. It's great that you have this app available and I've been using it for 10 months but can we pivot to showing where vaccines are or trying to help out with where that is? It's great finding out about all the problems with COVID but now that there's actually a solution available it'd be good to know where to find them instead of going to 50 different websites<br> :date: __2021-02-02 04:03:23__

> I suggest adding PA stats about vaccinations....as well as info on or even ability to make a vaccine appointment...and current phase status<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:24:51__

> Bad this app should notify those doctor to go and give those the vacinne that have fill the information out not have people out in large line and groups with this you have better control create job to new nursing school student to help in is fight<br> :date: __2021-01-21 07:21:53__

> Pros: It checks in everyday to review symptoms. It tells you information about what the rest of the app users symptoms were. It keeps up to date on what it is expected to. Con: I had my mom get Covid, and at the time I lived with her. I couldn't figure out how to report that since I tested negative. Not long after my family finished quarantine, my sister tested positive . I got tested again and was still negative, but technically I was exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:05:20__

> It says my exposure isd turned of but doesn't allow me to turn it on.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:18__

> It would be nice if there was a spot on the daily check in section of the app that had a CURRENT LOST OF SYMPTOMS. Just asking if you're okay or not doesn't help people to realize if they may have symptoms or not.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:21:29__

> this isn't a reflective rating on this app; however, maybe this is proof on how well my VPN is working.. because i don't live in PA. does it even matter that i don't live in PA, if i was wanting to use the app? this raises another concern of mine. my VPN is on all the time, so how could this app, if i did set it up, know where I've been? does it all permission to bypass VPN settings? if not, how would it accurately know where I've been? or have i been mislead on what a VPN does?<br> :date: __2021-01-08 06:20:15__

> Unfortunately, not enough people use this for it to be useful.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 20:29:16__

> The app is simple enough to understand, but the methodology of the Public Health department makes the app useless. I am covid positive, and cannot "sound the alarm" through the app without a special code that was never given to me. So how is the alert system supposed to work if I can't alert anyone??<br> :date: __2020-12-10 06:03:19__

> So introverted I was never around anyone long enough to set it off, but I was around people who contracted covid<br> :date: __2021-02-25 14:50:54__

> Same old info every day. Got name in 5-6 places. Much more vaccine than Delivery<br> :date: __2021-02-07 23:49:49__

> Exposure alert does not work, or I'll get a call next month that I've been exposed to COVID 6 weeks after it matters. A co-worker, that has the app with the alert ON, tested positive weeks ago. I work side by side with him everyday and found out a week after he was out why he was out. Not through the app though.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 00:01:31__

> Only good if you live in PA. Not valid for anywhere else.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 17:58:17__

> Where's the question of have you been vaccinated? Let's see the important info and show how PA is lagging behind.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 18:14:18__

> Not info I need. Where are vaccination sites? What are age requirements? Who is now eligible?, etc.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 18:11:05__

> There was no way to quickly self-report a positive test, so the contact tracing is useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:55:09__

> Since the last update they took off the daily death count. They only tell you the total death count up to the current date. Because of this the app doesn't exactly tell you the whole situation currently. In begining I actually liked the way app, but since of the many changes that isn't the case anymore. I feel as if they are trying to hide the real truth to the situation & that isn't a good thing at all.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 20:53:01__

> Useless to the consumer, IMO. The information is sketchy, at best; and, where it truly matters, there is no real information.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 20:38:03__

> Was OK. Now it has Vaccine info and wants my birthday. In order to put it in the way you have it set up, I would have to go back on your calendar 67 years, one month at a time (about 800 taps to reach Nov 1953). Please fix this with drop downs vs calendar selection. Otherwise, it's useless.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 21:18:34__

> Gave phone virus<br> :date: __2021-02-16 13:14:34__

> Besides the fact that the app is not that great, in no way do I trust The People's Republic of Pennsylvania. I guess their drones in the sky constantly watching us weren't enough. Now they want to use our phones to track us better. I'd like to believe this is to help with COVID but my gut tells me otherwise.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 04:21:03__
