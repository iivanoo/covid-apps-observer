### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children
<br>under the age of 13.,
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Usable. But this app *could* be so much more.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:32:47__

> Meh... This app NEEDS an "I've been vaccinated" indicator and a way to store and prove vaccination information. Get on it.<br> :date: __2021-04-04 17:05:03__

> Covid-19, I know Corona Virus has changed all! I'm super disappointed in are system! China is swiping anal canal now! My only concern is, the ones with higher strang will probably be cloned in a robot! Biggest organ, Skinned perfectly put on Technology Robot. The real human to all but died of covid-19, to battle a working world for the humans that survived! At one time only one child. Wanting Boy. Afraid of the power of desperation! I know USA is a abarsement. President Trump, I believe in You<br> :date: __2021-03-09 11:08:59__

> Not what I expected, not the kind of information I was looking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 08:04:10__

> Now that there's a vaccine why don't you show where there's a vaccine. It's great that you have this app available and I've been using it for 10 months but can we pivot to showing where vaccines are or trying to help out with where that is? It's great finding out about all the problems with COVID but now that there's actually a solution available it'd be good to know where to find them instead of going to 50 different websites<br> :date: __2021-02-02 04:03:23__

> I suggest adding PA stats about vaccinations....as well as info on or even ability to make a vaccine appointment...and current phase status<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:24:51__

> Bad this app should notify those doctor to go and give those the vacinne that have fill the information out not have people out in large line and groups with this you have better control create job to new nursing school student to help in is fight<br> :date: __2021-01-21 07:21:53__

> Pros: It checks in everyday to review symptoms. It tells you information about what the rest of the app users symptoms were. It keeps up to date on what it is expected to. Con: I had my mom get Covid, and at the time I lived with her. I couldn't figure out how to report that since I tested negative. Not long after my family finished quarantine, my sister tested positive . I got tested again and was still negative, but technically I was exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:05:20__

> It says my exposure isd turned of but doesn't allow me to turn it on.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:18__

> It would be nice if there was a spot on the daily check in section of the app that had a CURRENT LOST OF SYMPTOMS. Just asking if you're okay or not doesn't help people to realize if they may have symptoms or not.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:21:29__

> I received a contact tracing covid alert on 3.11.2021. It did not tell me when this happened so i had no idea what to do. Got tested, Negative, but no clear time line to quarantine since no date of exposure was given<br> :date: __2021-03-16 13:14:29__

> Forces you to page back through EVERY month of EVERY year to get to your date of birth, rather than either just typing it or selecting the year from a list. I just don't have enough time to page back that far.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 15:51:30__

> Had to go back 73yrs just to get to your site with a arrow one by one.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 18:57:57__

> So introverted I was never around anyone long enough to set it off, but I was around people who contracted covid<br> :date: __2021-02-25 14:50:54__

> Same old info every day. Got name in 5-6 places. Much more vaccine than Delivery<br> :date: __2021-02-07 23:49:49__

> Exposure alert does not work, or I'll get a call next month that I've been exposed to COVID 6 weeks after it matters. A co-worker, that has the app with the alert ON, tested positive weeks ago. I work side by side with him everyday and found out a week after he was out why he was out. Not through the app though.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 00:01:31__

> Only good if you live in PA. Not valid for anywhere else.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 17:58:17__

> Where's the question of have you been vaccinated? Let's see the important info and show how PA is lagging behind.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 18:14:18__

> This app just had a huge data breach<br> :date: __2021-05-03 15:16:08__

> WARNING DATA BREACH HAS OCCURED WITH THIS APP!!!!! DO NOT USE!!!! I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS APP LAST YEAR!!!! Sorry, don't trust it. Your data is uploaded to the Amazon cloud and location is obviously monitored. If you come in contact with a covid carrier that has their location on that data is sent. Governor wolf's mandates have been ruled unconstitutional. Big brother is watching now! This app is just enslavement to tyranny. Encouraging fearful interactions with other Americans. Do you trust Wolf and his obscure "covid" team that decided what they considered life sustaining services? NOPE.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 21:03:21__

> How helpful can it be, today is 4/27/21, the info was last updated 4/18/21. Good thing I'm not depending on it letting me or others know about exposures. Or maybe PA has stopped using it?<br> :date: __2021-04-27 12:07:53__

> This app only works if people report their symptoms. So if no one does then you know if you've come in contact with anyone with the Chinese virus. I work all around Pittsburgh and you always hear about numbers going up. Either this app doesn't report it or the government is lying.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 18:26:13__
