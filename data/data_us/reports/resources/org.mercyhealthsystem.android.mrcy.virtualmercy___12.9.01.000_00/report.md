## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Mercyhealth |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Needed a simple antibiotic for an ear infection which I get about twice a year. Would not prescribe anything for me, even tough that's listed as one of the benefits of the site. Today, my eardrum ruptured due to the extreme pressure of the infection, causing quite a bit of bleeding onto my neck and pillow. Would a picture of the blood convince anyone of what I needed and did not receive ??? Complained to " customer service ". Never got a response. Nothing. Time to look for another provider...<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:29:19__
