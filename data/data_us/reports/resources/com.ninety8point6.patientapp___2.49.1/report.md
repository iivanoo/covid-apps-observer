### Description
> 98point6 provides on-demand diagnosis, treatment and consultation from board-certified physicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy—all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get the right care at the right time. No appointments, no travel. We’re available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. 
<br>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
<br>There are two ways to get 98point6: via a Personal Plan or a Sponsored Plan.
<br>Personal Plans subscriptions come at an introductory rate of $30 for the first 3 months, with unlimited access to on-demand care for just $1 per visit. When that initial period ends, you have the option to enroll in an annual plan for only $120 per year + $1 per visit. (Please note, only one patient per account. You must be 18+ to create an account and seek care; 19+ in Nebraska.)
<br>Some employers, health plans and retailers provide access to 98point6 at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your plan sponsor.
<br>WHAT DOES MY PERSONAL PLAN SUBSCRIPTION COVER?
<br>Your 98point6 Personal Plan provides you access to our board-certified physicians who offer consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Insurance is not required for your visits. Patients are responsible for any outside-of-app costs, including prescriptions, labs and visits to an in-person physician, if referred. 
<br>WHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS?
<br>Our virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected, board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible and affordable. They are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (98point6 supports photo, video and audio as needed.)
<br>WHAT CAN YOU TREAT? 
<br>Our board-certified physicians are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when it matters, guide you towards the most appropriate next steps. If your issue does require in-person care, you can be sure you’re on the right path to feeling better after consulting with a 98point6 physician. 
<br> 
<br>Common conditions we treat include:
<br>• Cold, cough and flu
<br>• Urinary tract infections (UTI)
<br>• Acid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues
<br>• Yeast infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
<br>• Muscle sprains and strains
<br>• Seasonal allergies, asthma and respiratory issues
<br>• Skin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn
<br>• Women’s health, such as birth control 
<br>• Nausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis 
<br>• General health questions
<br>• ...and more
<br> 
<br>WHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? 
<br>Our doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications. However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what’s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. 
<br> 
<br>Note: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | 98point6 Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.98point6.com](https://www.98point6.com) |
| **Email** | support@98point6.com |
| **Physical address**  | [701 5th Ave, Ste 2300 Seattle, WA 98104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/701%205th%20Ave,%20Ste%202300%20Seattle,%20WA%2098104) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App works really well but is a waste of time. Dr wouldn't answer any of my questions and told me to go see a Dr. I can't really complain though. I guess you get what you pay for.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 06:38:47__

> Takes a while to actually communicate with a real doctor, and then of course its still just texting, no voice, which I don't like. But I appreciated getting a doctor's opinion on a covid matter.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 00:55:56__

> Decided to give app a shot. Got connected to a doctor. She did not listen, listed my symptoms completely wrong, and wrong diagnosis. Since this time, I have spoken with management, not customer service. They listened to the issues and will hopefully correct them. It is a fairly new app, with time there may be improvement.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 23:39:39__

> Very thorough<br> :date: __2020-08-10 14:03:47__

> Useless if you need a dr for children. At this time its only for adults. Which they didnt tell me until AFTER i paid for a subscription and started speaking with a dr<br> :date: __2020-04-19 22:11:02__

> Completely useless. Three attempts, three disconnected sessions, no resolution of any kind, an hour of wasted time. Edit... increasing to three stars due to customer service response phone call. App still needs work.<br> :date: __2020-04-15 18:57:13__

> Chat based telehealth has a lot of potential, and the app worked fine, but the doctor barely said anything. He didn't tell me his diagnosis, just said "I think we can treat this with strong topical antibiotics", and confirmed my pharmacy. I had to ask him what he was prescribing. He responded with 1 word (the medicine name), and them ended the chat - didn't tell me how to use it or how long it would take to heal or ask if I had any other questions, etc. Left me with little confidence.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 20:56:16__

> Interface is not user friendly. But, with persistence you can manage it. I made a mistake filling out the create account form, my birthday was wrong. However, the form pointed me to my name, which it allowed me two tries and then I had to uninstall to get more attempts to get the information correct. I could understand a password. I have yet to use it to see a doctor. I hope that experience is better.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:41:33__

> Not helpful and slow<br> :date: __2020-03-26 22:26:44__

> Used this app previously and it worked great now it keeps asking me to set up a profile but not giving me a way to advance. No way to contact tech support anywhere in the app. Great concept now let's get the bugs out.<br> :date: __2020-03-08 07:33:57__

> 27 minute wait and it didn't buzz or anything once they answered so I missed it 😡<br> :date: __2021-04-29 07:29:10__

> Only pertaining to one time, I felt rushed and one question he gave me no options or suggestions<br> :date: __2021-04-22 20:45:46__

> No point in an online Doctor if they are still going to send you to a doctor for a simple urinary tract infection that you and every other woman gets a couple of times a year!<br> :date: __2021-04-06 20:36:14__

> I don't know if this is the way to go<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:40:30__

> I don't think this doctor listened to what I said.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 16:55:58__

> Great concept but a real cra\*\*y app. I have insurance. The only questions asked have nothing to do with anything other than basic personal info. You got next and theb told your not covered. $120? I don't think so. Some of us are on social security<br> :date: __2020-08-14 14:02:12__

> Didn't like it<br> :date: __2020-08-12 20:17:58__

> Some doctors know what they are doing and actually get to the point. Others happen to treat you like a box to be checked off regardless of whether or not you receive correct treatment. But most commonly, doctors treat you like you're faking to be sick just to talk to nab a prescription. In my case, I have 2 ear infections, a sinus infection, and acute tonsilitis. I'm motion sick, nauseous, my head is heavy, I have varying fevers, etc and they won't give me antibiotics. A local clinic covered me.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 03:36:11__

> The app is great concept, meaning you dont have to get up to see a doctor as you can speak to a doctor right on your phone. The reason why I purchase the app was for that reason. My Bartholin Gland was very swollen and I was in severe pain, too painful to get up. I spoke to a doctor who told me to go to the ER. I didn't want to go to the ER considering the circumstance that at this time there is a COVID19 epidemic and I didn't want to be selfish to occupy a room when someone else needs. No meds<br> :date: __2020-07-05 21:15:22__

> Computer questions redundant, did not correctly respond. Example: I said no cough, it kept asking about my cough. Today I attempted follow-up, but did not get notification when Dr. available. Dr. ended chat one minute before I checked again.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 19:22:01__

> Absolutely useless, I've had 2 appointments and both times they told me to go to a doctor for just routine illness. What is the reason to use this app if they just tell you to go in person everytime? The whole point is trying to avoid going in public while ill but apparently they don't understand that.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 16:22:05__

> Doctors won't order regular check up or lab work if you ask for. They will tell you to go for an in person consultation. Also it's only for adults, if you have children, they won't help you.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:00:38__

> Horrific experience. I filled out the application and once I got connected (after almost and hour) the doctor said he couldn't help without a single question asked. We won't use it again.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 03:49:21__

> The doctor just copied and pasted stuff at me and didn't listen.<br> :date: __2021-04-22 18:50:24__

> What's the point of getting charged $40 for a "visit" that's just the doctor telling me I'll need to see a doctor in person? If I could see a doctor in person, I wouldn't be using an app like this in the first place.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 12:44:04__

> Didn't let me get a personal plan app failed from there<br> :date: __2021-03-18 08:33:08__

> This service is a joke. Happy to take your money and direct you to a real doctor for a real assessment. Wish I had thought of this business model.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 16:40:18__

> Useless have earache and congestion told cant help me<br> :date: __2021-03-13 17:49:44__

> Not good<br> :date: __2021-03-01 01:17:03__

> I received terrible customer service from the 98point6 doctors during virtual visits on several occasions. They rushed through the visits, didn't listen to me or give me time to explain my heathcote concerns or needs. Their doctors ended the visits abruptly and signed out of the app before I could even finish asking them questions. Highly DO NOT recommend this app!<br> :date: __2021-02-28 22:13:06__
