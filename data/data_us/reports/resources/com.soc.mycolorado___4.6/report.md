## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app worked fine until april/may 2021. Now the app just crashes. The app is a good idea and nice especially if on a bike so you dont need to carry as much, problem is the app does not and will not stay open. It crashes constantly and some features will not open at all and when tried, it causes the app to crash as well. I wish the powers at be could get this app to actually work. Ride safe, Kg<br> :date: __2021-06-17 23:40:36__

> It won't let me access it or send me verification code, but thank you for at least responding to my issues here! I just thought it was never going to be addressed, I appreciate that!<br> :date: __2021-06-12 01:05:14__

> Authentication does not work if cell phone service is not available. May make app useless.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 07:30:23__

> It's cool works 50/50 some people take it some dont<br> :date: __2021-05-25 22:10:37__

> Confusing to use. It wanted me to center my face in an oval, but then just hung.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 05:46:10__

> Nice but missing alot .. good luck businesses excepting it !<br> :date: __2021-04-24 11:16:20__

> Bugs for days But the idea is phonemial<br> :date: __2021-04-21 02:26:35__

> Used to keep me logged in. Know I have to log in every time and the app has to ping my phone evert time 🤔🥴<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:26:24__

> In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:42:03__

> 2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. 👍When this app is working, its amazing.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 05:22:11__

> This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with "certificate errors" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 06:47:57__

> App keeps crashing when opening insurance section.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:00:54__

> Not for use in any situation where speed or proof of insurance is necessary. Alot of layers of security just to open the app, then I'd get kicked completely out of the app when I tried to open the proof of insurance. Then of course all the security again. I ended up using the paper documents anyway. And didn't we fight a war or something to avoid apps like this anyway?<br> :date: __2021-06-19 04:59:48__

> Unable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification code every time I'm trying to log in which is sent to my old phone number which I don't have access to because it's my old phone number so I don't know how I'm going to access my information because I can't access the account with my old number so this is kind of dumbUnable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification<br> :date: __2021-06-16 00:19:38__

> Not great experience. Cannot seem to link digital fishing license to app. Very sluggish app.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 00:02:32__

> Doesn't work. Scans and then says I need a license which it scanned.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 15:44:47__

> Seems like every update you have to re-register. Could be a decent, it's just not reliable. Maybe you could try to architect it so that you reuse the user data after each update??<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:31:46__

> Nine out of 10 times I'm unable to log in. On the few times I've been able to get to the authentication page afterwards I get an error message. I thought this app would be a game changer having everything in one place but I can't even get it to open<br> :date: __2021-06-10 22:22:06__

> Works for drivers license. Fishing and hunting licenses dont show up.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 00:42:26__

> It does not make any situation more convenient and when prompted, the information doesn't open. A screenshot won't work and signal is needed to open the necessary information. Unfortunately trails and streams don't have wifi yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 17:40:14__

> Doesn't work, just get an error code upon trying to log in.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 16:53:02__

> Was once brilliant. Now I can't sign in. I called and was on hold, person answered, then hung up. I called again, left my phone number for a customer service rep to call me back, got the call, answered, then they hung up. Just incompetent and unprofessional. Get it together.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 04:18:57__
