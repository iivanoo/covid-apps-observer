## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:42:03__

> Nine out of 10 times I'm unable to log in. On the few times I've been able to get to the authentication page afterwards I get an error message. I thought this app would be a game changer having everything in one place but I can't even get it to open<br> :date: __2021-06-10 22:22:06__

> Works for drivers license. Fishing and hunting licenses dont show up.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 00:42:26__

> It does not make any situation more convenient and when prompted, the information doesn't open. A screenshot won't work and signal is needed to open the necessary information. Unfortunately trails and streams don't have wifi yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 17:40:14__

> When it wants to verify me by taking a picture the oval frame is black and wont take a picture. The app is useless to me if i cant use it for its intended purpose.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 16:14:20__

> Have had 2021 fishing lic for 3 weeks and it's still not available on myColo????<br> :date: __2021-04-23 01:26:14__

> In my house and put that in your house In<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:02:00__

> To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 01:43:26__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">

> It's absolutely useless. The image recognition tool simply does not work. Surely there is a better way to verify identity.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 01:07:58__

> Won't accept my password to sign-in, and won't accept my existing password to let me change my password. So, it's completely useless. You wouldn't want to rely on this for ID.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 21:41:36__

> Just created a new account only to get to the login page for it tell me it doesn't recognize my password or username. Waste of an app.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 16:08:01__

> Created an account and can't log in plus no way to recover account. Trouble logging in button does nothing : (<br> :date: __2021-06-10 06:17:46__

> My app was working just fine and I was using it constantly then about a month ago it stopped working. When I would log in it would go back and forth to the pingid and login screen. It will not properly work. I also sent an email about it and never received a response back. This app needs to work properly!<br> :date: __2021-06-09 16:32:52__

> Can even get the app to scan my ID. So many other people are having the same issue. would not give any stars for the Shyte quality CO wants to make their ID's from.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 03:23:37__

> Would be cool if it worked. Camera worked the first day and then never again. Can't verify or upload anything. Sweet app. Can I have my info back please!<br> :date: __2021-06-05 20:03:40__

> Went to the DMV literally TODAY, and it will not authenticate me. Says it can't match my photo. I look exactly like i did 3 hours ago, hairstyle, clothes and all. This is absurd.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 23:46:20__

> This is what happens when the government is tasked with make a app that works. It doesn't, And just like the government it probably never will!!<br> :date: __2021-06-03 23:50:43__

> If I could give it a zero star i would. Tryed to face scan an it didnt even reconize me. So i tried again an its just a black oval to scan ur face even in the brightest light. I will just wait for my id to come in the mail. This app is a pain in the you know what.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 04:44:08__
