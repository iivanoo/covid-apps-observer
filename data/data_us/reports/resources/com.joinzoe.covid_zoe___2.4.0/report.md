### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use. Adaptable so additional research can be done. Allows us guinea pigs to contribute to the sum total of human knowledge.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:54:11__

> Happy to contribute but no map data for my area during the past few months which is frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 09:58:04__

> Easy to use - check you get to bottom of page<br> :date: __2021-03-13 21:28:43__

> Could the record of test results be displayed in reverse order as when you have taken a lot of tests it is a pain having to scroll to the bottom just to say the list is correct.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 12:26:44__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-03-13 12:15:22__

> I have been using the app since it was first released and have been happy with it's simplicity and the various articles are interesting and give a lot of insight. I am however, unhappy that despite having the latest version installed, I have not received the promised vaccine questions despite uninstalling and reinstalling. I have also emailed them several times about this but have received no response.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 11:24:06__

> Was OK until recently. Now android version goes to blank screen at log in stage. Tried reinstalling - same tesult. Please fix. Statistics somewhat erratic possibly down to low relatively low numbers in each area. Blank screen syndrome fixed quickly. Recent alterations in handling report numbers also improved erratic results.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 09:03:40__

> Eesy good<br> :date: __2021-03-12 12:57:57__

> App works as expected, bonus is the clear, concise videos about the state of the pandemic.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 22:49:03__

> The app is easy to use and I really like all the research info and the access to recordings of the webinars. My only criticism is that you never get an answer if you ask a question using their email contact. Other than that I think the app is brilliant and does an excellent and useful job.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 11:34:40__

> App is OK for answering their set questions but doesn't give much opportunity to offer feedback. Takes up a lot of memory for not much functionality.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 16:23:25__

> It works but I will be glad when it is no longer necessary.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 11:18:07__

> It seems to give different numbers for the number in your area eg today Dartford 318 and the result for your area on the map eg Dartford 87 ?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:36:50__

> It works ok<br> :date: __2021-03-09 20:46:18__

> Does not seem to recognise lateral flow tests. Could not input vaccine side effects 4 days later, wanted me to go for a test. I really struggle with the feeling fine /not quite right question when pre menstrual. If I'm honest, I get sent for an unnecessary test. If I'm not honest, there's no point in doing it! I wish there was a way of saying 'I'm not right but I'm pretty certain that it's because of this'<br> :date: __2021-03-09 00:03:53__

> I deleted this app because it was using vast amounts of storage space. For an app that does very little I do not understand why..<br> :date: __2021-03-05 15:24:03__

> Seems to have update issues. Im on same version as husband - he can add vaccination details but I can't. Good information feedback and invites to interesting webinars<br> :date: __2021-03-01 13:46:32__

> Completely lack the ability for user to review own symptoms. I wasn't to see my data!<br> :date: __2021-03-01 11:56:15__

> Sometimes my information doesn't go through and I have to do it over.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 00:13:25__

> Hasn't sent reminders since an update in November.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:14:46__

> Good for up to date info. I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-03-10 12:56:37__

> I had a lateral test turns out to be positive and a lab test turns out negative, does this app help me what I need to do next NO. Use the lab tests use the track and trace app. More accurate.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 09:54:30__

> Cannot find where I put my daily health check in<br> :date: __2021-03-08 12:31:19__

> It seems to make up local cases numbers on the fly. My area hasn't seen more than 6900 cases since the start of the pandemic, yet apparently, according to the app we've had nearly 15k... Something's amiss here<br> :date: __2021-03-07 10:44:34__

> Has been great until today, then froze. Rebooted phone and 95 days of data lost. Including all inputs on jabs and dates.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:02:38__

> The 'app' has been very good for months.. Since the latest upgrade it has been an absolute 'pain'. Having to login- enter a oassword and email Every time!! the screens do nit wiek on my phone.. boxes are constricted so that I cannot see the options!! What a shame tou had to change something that was working very well!!!<br> :date: __2021-03-05 14:33:31__

> W we 9<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:36:42__

> Well done<br> :date: __2021-02-15 11:52:26__

> Have started to notice the "cases in your area" function does not work anymore. Discrepancies between number of cases and chart details. This number also fluctuates up to 50% on some days.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:58:38__

> difficulty in navigation and screen has frozen several times when entering data.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:06:47__

> Very easy to use. Rating given was 5. But Update PROBLEMS 3 MARCH 2021 APP SEEMS TO BE EXTREMELY SLOW TO LOAD for daily input AND HAS BEEN FOR 2 OR 3 WEEKS. Rating dropped to 1, sorry. Update 14th mar 2021 STILL extremely slow and failing to load my information!!<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:12:04__

> Not impressed with the smoothing of infection rates lines. Feels like it's not as transparent anymore. If rates were cresting I'd avoid shops. Impossible to tell now. Map of Location of positive test results reported in the app over last 2 weeks has no boarder lines and impossible to tell where these black dots are. Are they near by or next county? Map is useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 11:04:51__

> I have been entering data every day since installing this over 9 months ago. I now have a new phone and my also no longer have access to my email address I used to register with, do sapdly won't be using the app anymore.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 16:33:55__

> I'm not recieving updates like other which is frustrating. I have information regarding vaccine to input.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 08:05:11__

> Update: there is still a blank white space where the graphs should be. All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis & 'Share the graph', nothing else. Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe, have now had a response asking for screenshots which I sent a few days ago. Still awaiting a resolution to this issue...I opened the app today to report in: still no graphs or maps...It is a good app, but I do wish they would hurry up & resolve this.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 13:08:50__

> Was interested in contributing but can not set up log in. Keeps saying invalid parameters/missing info. (Yes I went over it several times).<br> :date: __2021-03-05 19:06:38__

> Just more Spyware<br> :date: __2021-02-27 23:03:23__

> The mental health survey popup appears to have broken the app for me. I cannot do anything except see the popup, so I cannot report my health any more.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 20:56:34__

> Useless since its upgrade have tried to uninstal, reinstalling, forgotten password reset it refuses to work. I will remove it and not bother anymore.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 09:48:35__

> Wouldn't let me register as I don't know my blood group. Totally useless<br> :date: __2021-02-20 14:13:52__
