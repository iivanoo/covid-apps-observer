### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the Stateâ€™s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the usersâ€™ privacy, these keys are only kept on the userâ€™s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> We have several cases of Covid around the corner and the app does not show them. Very disappointed! I hoped this app would help keep my family safe. The app is working. They must have fixed the bugs!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 04:13:22__

> Simple, easy, negligible effect on battery, and unobtrusive. That's great. The biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't indicate that it's even working in any way. I'd suggest that it at least note the number of other devices that it encountered on a daily basis, so a user would 1. be able to gauge how many actual potential exposures they've had and 2. see that the app is actually doing something. e.g. 'You saw 7 other phones today with the CA Notify app...no exposures reported."<br> :date: __2021-02-09 08:19:14__

> very disappointed! I first downloaded it help contribute data that would help the state, country,and even the world. I Don't like the fact that bloototh always has to b on<br> :date: __2021-04-17 06:47:59__

> This app needs the option to report if you have been near another user running this app but not tested positive so you can verify the app is actually doing something. I reinstalled this app to see if it has been changed. While it now shows its active, it still fails to show it is actually functioning correctly. It needs to show it is actually communicating with others using this app by showing you were near someone else using this app. Still no response, guess their just part of the Covid scam<br> :date: __2021-04-08 00:01:15__

> Not really see working<br> :date: __2021-04-05 05:02:45__

> Nice concept but im not convinced its effective enough to justify battery drain and storage space- uninstalling and taking my chances.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 07:32:45__

> Bad battery drain. Without the app installed I finish my day at 9pm around 30% battery on S21. With the app installed my phone is at 30% by 3pm. Similar use both days.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 05:12:14__

> Ca Notify Need to work on the Bugs. I can't have the app. On My phone cause it broke the texting link that I have with My Mom.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 00:55:32__

> It messes up my other bluetooth connections. Only noticed this recently that connection to my car bt would fail where it was prior fine. Same problem on other earlier paired devices. Once I uninstalled this app everything went back to normal<br> :date: __2021-03-08 00:43:59__

> It just used resources but I was never notified of any outbreaks.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 01:01:33__

> How does this work? I read online but I don't get how it can tell if you have covid or not. Does it take the positive people's identities and connect it with the phone or do people with covid have to manually put in that they tested positive? If they have to manually put it in, it's unlikely that they will. I give it 2 stars for the effort but I don't understand how its suppose to tell who has covid or not.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 00:53:52__

> CA Notify used to appear on my phone, but I can't see it anymore. I tried to download it again, and my computer says that CA Notify is installed on my phone. Why can't I see it there?<br> :date: __2021-02-24 20:14:24__

> Uninstalled because California is opening up and people are being forced to intermingle even though we don't have vaccines in the majority. So why help a cause that doesn't matter anymore!<br> :date: __2021-04-15 02:06:28__

> I have the app. Then had to call to allow people to know they've been exposed. I then wasn't in your system and I have to wait a few days to call again to get the verification code. Not very convenient and put multiple obstacles in my way of trying to notify others.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 13:11:27__

> Noot good<br> :date: __2021-04-07 10:21:56__

> Useless unless someone volunteers to report themselves when sick.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 19:30:43__

> This is lame. It's only valid if 1) everyone uses the apo, and 2) everyone who has Covid actually adds that to the app. Not everything is meant for crowd sourcing!<br> :date: __2021-03-29 08:32:00__

> Covid 19 is just a play to take our rights away. Cant go to school or church but if you got reservations to the french laundry, good too go #recall newsom<br> :date: __2021-03-29 07:22:18__

> Can't disable bluetooth notification. I don't always keep bluetooth on, and I don't need to be constantly reminded by this app that it's off. This should be a separate notification toggle.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 15:34:43__

> I understand this is based on people voluntarily adding covid +ve result so that others get alert. But having this on my phone for months now, I am always skeptical whether it is even doing anything other than consuming phone resources and probably tracking my location. I read all the other reviews below about actual covid +ve people unable to actually add the positive test and the app's failure to send notification to others. I am convinced this is useless app. Uninstalling now.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 15:33:51__

> Good idea, extremely poor execution.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 00:10:10__

> I thought this was a good idea for safety but it doesn't seem to work cuz after the fact I was normally exposed and it did not work I was not notified my Bluetooth was on<br> :date: __2021-03-15 03:59:48__
