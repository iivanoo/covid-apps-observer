### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> I practice all the guidelines that is set .I stay home and have had no signs or symptoms of Covid-19 . A good move , heard about states that have this in place , everyone need to participate to help stop the spread of this disease , should have been done sooner .What is real or not, to update and not know why is useless .<br> :date: __2021-01-08 23:27:40__

> Although I am being very careful, and have not gotten notified of exposure, I am glad to have this out there.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 23:21:29__

> The app runs - so far, no notifications.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 22:50:50__

> Now, if only NC citizens would simply be honest about their exposing others to their positive Covid test as soon as notified. Instead, so many are carelessly waiting until they get negative result. Meanwhile the positives are spreading Covid in neighborhoods, stores, churches, and other public places... WITH NO MASKS! Just because you didn't need ICU, doesn't mean others you exposed will be as fortunate. Get Behind THE Mask! üôèüò∑üôè<br> :date: __2020-12-07 04:22:22__

> I decided to update this review. I haven't changed the rating as of yet but probably will have to after I get some kind of answers. On January 10th, 2021 my app stopped reporting. On the 11th I had to call off from work due to a fever and symptom scare. I did test negative for Covid, but the timing of it all couldn't be worse. I mean, three days, during my wait for answers. How is that helping anyone? I work at a high traffic State facility and thought I could rely on this to help.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:34:00__

> Dont know if it really works<br> :date: __2021-01-11 15:02:14__

> Just need more people to use it.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 17:20:33__

> Exposures haven't updated for a week... Your reply didn't address my concern.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 03:03:52__

> Does not work<br> :date: __2021-01-04 17:01:24__

> I uninstalled. App is only as good as everyone uses it. No one I work with has the app. Point less if no one else downloads.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:38:26__

> Great idea if everyone used it and tested frequently. I had Covid in July before getting the app. No notifications of exposure for me even after shopping at a mall for Christmas.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:31:21__

> Tho it shows option to choose metrics, they cannot be changed. Having to obtain (& wait for) a pin is an encumbrance & bottleneck as well. Will deter ppl from using the app. Have found this app to be of minimal utility, unfortunately.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 21:43:28__

> The idea of this app is great, but because of the way it's run it becomes useless. I have had the app for 2-3 months. I tested positive on Dec 29th, so I called to get the required number to alert the app. I was told that I would have to wait 48 hours, I called back and was told that I needed to call my health department and then call back the next day, I called back the next day and was told that my number was 'too new to use try again in 48 hours'. What's the point of using it now?<br> :date: __2021-01-09 21:11:34__

> Not sure how effective this is unless there's greater usage than we are seeing now. I was at my docs office yesterday, and was 6 feet away from 2 people with positive tests. Not a thing's showing up on this program.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 20:43:07__

> Not enough people using the app<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:21:42__

> There hasn't been any check since Dec 25, 2020. This is concerning. The exposure notification is turned on.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 18:44:02__

> A small percentage of people are downloading this for Android (can't speak for iOS), and such a small percentage of people are actually tested daily in this state. It's more like a gimmick app unless everyone downloads and everyone gets weekly testing.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 16:28:03__

> While I love the idea powering this app actually acquiring a pin takes so long that the app becomes useless. I finally received my positive test result four days after showing symptoms and when I called in to get my pin, I was told that I would have to wait a few days and call in again. By the time I actually get my pin the incubation period for the people I may have had contact with will be over and they'll probably have symptoms before they even get any notice from the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:23:48__

> There's not enough people using the app for it to work. Like, even in the busiest stores, the app doesn't find any exposures.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 23:35:16__

> Just got app I'll let you know later!<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:56:23__

> I tried contacting them, and my test was not showing up in their system so they could not give me a PIN. I used the link your provided and I also called when the link was telling me I wasn't in the system.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 14:54:23__

> It was a great idea but the pin access on the website didn't work.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:10:37__

> Has not checked for exposures since January 9th. Checked to make sure the app is not being put to sleep. I have had 3 known exposures in the 10 days. Getting tested today, not because of the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 12:55:46__

> No this app does not work. I tested positive in December and the still don't have me listed. I've called the number too and they just say to call back in a few days. Useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 16:56:58__

> Disappointed. Not Effective. I've had this for a while; encouraged ppl to download it. Up until yesterday, it worked well - seemingly. It checked for exposures several times a day for the past two months or so. Last week, someone in my pod tested positive. It took her several days to put in a PIN. I've not been alerted yet (but I have isolated since her exposure and then positive test). This program has got to be faster to be effective. It's giving ppl a false of security.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:20:06__

> Not falling for your bs, its just compiling data for those who get covid after downloading this app, scam by big gov. Go try it on some dummies, your not getting this guy.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 05:21:54__

> I am a nurse and work in an emergency department. I have been exposed to covid multiple times per shift. This app says I've never been exposed. So it doesn't even deserve one star.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 14:08:31__

> This was a good idea with a big flaw. Getting a pin is not straight forward. Someone sick with Covid will not take the time to bother getting a pin. It should have been done like this... Sign up with the app with your cell phone number, you get Covid and the county health department should notify DHHS to send the exposure. This would have been easy to do using the cell phone number of the infected person. My wife had Covid and this app. She thought it updated using health department records.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:48:36__
