## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | BayCare Health System, Inc |
| **Website**  | [http://www.baycare.org/](http://www.baycare.org/) |
| **Email** | mobiledevelopers@baycare.org |
| **Physical address**  | [2985 Drew St. Clearwater, FL 33759](https://www.google.com/maps/search/2985%20Drew%20St.%20Clearwater,%20FL%2033759) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Appwould not open all the way would not open all the way<br> :date: __2020-11-03 21:59:30__

> I really like that we can take pictures and describe problems before being seen. Wish I could have used my Health Plan Credit Card. Wish we could enter our medical problem first and payment before picking a doctor. Also wish I could have entered PCP info first. You ask for their fax number. Who knows their dr's fax number? Why can't they get reports without it? You can see if different doctors are available or have patients waiting. But that can all change by the time we finish entering info<br> :date: __2020-10-18 02:54:48__

> I gave it four stars due to the loading is very slow not sure if it's the app itself or connection but I do have pretty good internet but a great app overall nice and convenient!<br> :date: __2020-10-11 19:25:42__

> Lost signal<br> :date: __2020-06-11 21:23:06__

> Audio was low, although I had on speaker phone and my media level was set at max. Possibly due to physician wearing mask. Video was perfect.<br> :date: __2020-05-18 17:53:54__

> The app froze at onr point oyherwise ok<br> :date: __2020-05-11 21:19:37__

> Getting in touch with customer service is a bit harder than it should be.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 23:21:27__

> The advertised cost was $59, which I paid before service. My online consultation was 10 minutes where I was told to go to the emergency room (good call, I needed surgery). But THEN I was sent a bill for an additional $16 with no explanation. I just know it wasn't for going over the alloted time. Not happy.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 22:12:37__

> Where is the cost to the patient? I guess they can charge what ever they can get from the insurance.. If no insurance how much will the cost be.. no way to find out from the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:35:02__

> Thanksjueas<br> :date: __2020-11-15 14:05:32__

> Excessively slow log in and spooling, but once connected via video to your provider it's smooth.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 15:40:46__

> I do REALLY appreciate this Application! Its super fast, very convenient& time saving.. it appears it's only function is appointment with ur primary doctor, or urgent care... I'm also 98% sure that there's a chance you can be charged 60$ just to have the appointment over ur smartphone or desktop 😊<br> :date: __2020-05-20 21:18:42__

> Once we were connected it was fine. But be for that I didn't know where to go on web site urgent care Medicare than spoke to some one I was waiting on Dr Lugo once connected every thing went fine. Web site took 5 minutes to load and I have high speed internet.<br> :date: __2020-04-17 17:36:09__

> Requiring an app download is pretty rediculous in 2020, particularly for something like tele-medicine. There are several other compliant tele-medicine services that offer full web based experience; it's shocking Baycare doesn't have the capital to invest in a useful platform.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 14:30:05__
