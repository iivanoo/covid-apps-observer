### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's a good idea, but the app has continuous problems.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 22:09:45__

> I am frustrated because I kept being asked to repeat my report. I have an aÃ±droid phone and I followed your advice to reinstall the app ensuring it is the latest version. I am NOT going to do that anymore and to that end I will not be reporting my status for a week to allow you to SORT this. Many, inclÃ¹ding those involved in deciding how we are all to live our lives. Your study group use our reports to develop models, which may be skewed by additional reporting.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 17:57:57__

> Useless junk. Stats are wrong. Crashes. Was working yesterday to a point but now unusable with just a white screen. Yesterday the graph showed a decrease in cases but the text stated an increase your information is a joke. Tried reinstalling , no difference , uninstalled, not wasting anymore time on this.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 21:23:55__

> Informative and reassuring, great app, a couple of months on and now the app is just a white screen, unable to open, please fix<br> :date: __2021-01-06 11:04:54__

> Stopped working 05 Jan 2021. Tried to uninstall then re install no good.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 19:22:08__

> The app won't let me on since the update as I don't know what my blood group is.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 18:12:28__

> Please update and fix white screen this happening before the main login and report screen. This app is so important to me and alot of others and the UK to get the facts and keeping calm. Please hurry .<br> :date: __2021-01-03 16:24:24__

> White screen of doom - I get through to the 'report today' screen very very briefly then it disappears and I get a blank white screen. Clearly not an issue just with my phone or my account by the look of other comments. I've reported daily for months and am disappointed not to be able to continue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 18:10:10__

> The app has stopped working today. It launches for a split second and then the screen goes all white. Update 1 Jan, it's working now.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 14:49:27__

> I am now unable to open the app despite uninstalling then reinstalling many times. It now works .. 12 MD 01 01 21<br> :date: __2021-01-01 13:19:08__

> No updated often enough<br> :date: __2021-01-01 11:34:07__

> I have to say I'm really pissed off with this. There was a fault and it stopped working for a while, now I'm getting emails asking me to reinstall but with no link in the email (a no reply email address!). When you think Facebook manages literally billions of accounts, fully indexed and cross referenced, and these clowns can't cope with a simple database.... I'm doing something else instead<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:41:45__
