### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Occasional glitches, but on the whole, app works well and happy to be helping<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:26:15__

> I had been using the app daily since March, but in late 2020 the reminders stopped working, so I only remember to log in periodically... I have reinstalled a number of times but nothing seems to fix it. Such a shame after all the team's hard work, can't they get any IT companies to fix these glitches??! PS one day later: tried reinstalling one more time and now finally the notifications are working again - yay!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 18:44:27__

> Does what it says on the tin, you can report your health and covid status to researchers. It can be quite buggy, which is annoying. I went 11 days being unable to report as I couldn't log in until they did a bug fix.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 13:58:19__

> Easy and quick to use. Now mostly warns if there is no connection. However if connection is later lost whilst reporting symptoms, this is not reported. \*\* Broken again: Graphs of All, Month, Week don't show any data \*\*<br> :date: __2021-01-02 11:49:29__

> Normally no problems with app easy to use, however over the last two days my wife nor myself have been able to report app only displaying a white screen even after uninstalling and re installing app glad to say all well now.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 11:27:23__

> Good to know I'm contributing but I did lapse for a while. I think my phone was at fault however. Quick and easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 12:22:17__

> Easy to use & hopefully effective in gathering relevant information.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 00:08:02__

> Good app. Important in these strange times to help understand this virus in some small way.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:25:49__

> Can't log as when opening I just get a white screen.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 17:37:55__

> The next second zip code feature is great. Thank you for addding. However it would be nice if the app then reported the new zip codes county if you have moved from your original. It would also be nice if the app remebered your previous second zip code.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:29:59__

> Excellent initiative but IT side is the weak link...filled in for 6 months then it did not recognise me despite doing all fixes so had to register under different name to continue its just such a loss of 6 months linked data. That said incredible work that is being done<br> :date: __2021-01-01 11:49:48__

> Yep, I've got the white screen issue now as well. Worked fine until lunchtime 31/12/2020. No matter what I do, uninstall, re-install it still loads and then goes full white screen so I can no longer participate. Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 09:49:05__

> Not sure what it's achieving<br> :date: __2020-12-31 09:24:17__

> Should be useful but seems limited and a tad buggy - stats charts don't show (android 10) when click them to go through to week/month etc view. No notifications despite ensuring they are turned on. And no differentiation between the old antibody test & symptom testing - I had an antibody test months ago when I returned to work. It was positive but never had any symptoms so should be able to clarify this. Also really feel there should be a link to the official number of cases for comparison.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 08:38:35__

> Very clear and useful. 30/12/20 app will not display month or weekly data in graph, only the full set to dec data. Latest version 2.2 and tried a force stop<br> :date: __2020-12-30 18:13:29__

> I have updated the app, but still not getting daily reminders<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:59:09__

> Report in daily but sometimes it's not recorded and I am being told that it's a day or more since I reported in<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:35:47__

> Worked ok until 19th December when it just showed a blank screen after loading. Same after updating. Shame but this type of app must be 100% reliable to be useful. Uninstalling Update 30.12.20 Re installed following email update; seems to be working now<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:33:18__

> I am frustrated because I kept being asked to repeat my report. I have an aÃ±droid phone and I followed your advice to reinstall the app ensuring it is the latest version. I am NOT going to do that anymore and to that end I will not be reporting my status for a week to allow you to SORT this. Many, inclÃ¹ding those involved in deciding how we are all to live our lives. Your study group use our reports to develop models, which may be skewed by additional reporting.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 17:57:57__

> Clear well thought out APP just need more people taking part. Or at least it was until I am now trapped with a white screen and seemingly no way of fixing it.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 09:27:18__

> It used to give me daily notifications to fill out the form but this stopped few months ago nothing I do can change this. Not sure if this is just me or others having the same issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:06:28__

> Used it since the start but reminders stopped two months ago so forget to do it<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:29:28__

> Reminders just stopped working and I cannot find a way to restart them. So useless as I forget to report each day<br> :date: __2020-12-31 08:23:11__

> I am told by the computer that the Symtoms Study has been installed, yet i am unable to enter data from my Android laptop<br> :date: __2020-12-30 19:18:53__

> Still unable to add the test result even after restarting the app as the email suggested<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:26:12__

> IT IS BROKEN AGAIN - CAN'T ENTER TEST RESULTS SINCE 17TH DECEMBER<br> :date: __2020-12-29 12:09:03__

> All, Month and Week graphs stopped working some time ago and the developer has not fixed them or responded to email.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 12:12:45__

> White screen of doom - I get through to the 'report today' screen very very briefly then it disappears and I get a blank white screen. Clearly not an issue just with my phone or my account by the look of other comments. I've reported daily for months and am disappointed not to be able to continue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 18:10:10__

> The app has stopped working today. It launches for a split second and then the screen goes all white. Update 1 Jan, it's working now.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 14:49:27__

> I am now unable to open the app despite uninstalling then reinstalling many times. It now works .. 12 MD 01 01 21<br> :date: __2021-01-01 13:19:08__

> No updated often enough<br> :date: __2021-01-01 11:34:07__

> I have to say I'm really pissed off with this. There was a fault and it stopped working for a while, now I'm getting emails asking me to reinstall but with no link in the email (a no reply email address!). When you think Facebook manages literally billions of accounts, fully indexed and cross referenced, and these clowns can't cope with a simple database.... I'm doing something else instead<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:41:45__

> Have been an enthusiastic user but sadly Tim Spector is misusing his data to make dangerous pronouncements. There are now better more accurate data sources available so the job here has been done...at this point users are just potential customers for Zoe's diet plans.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:22:05__

> The app is broken... Loads to a white screen.. Deleted and reloaded... Sign in then opens to a white blank screen again, unable to fill in any details...<br> :date: __2020-12-29 11:02:43__

> COVID data for my region is out of alignment with PHE and worryingly the app shows a fall of ~500 from last week and PHE showing a rise of 158 (~39%). True the figures shown widely disagree but the trends should be consistent. The app appears to be making the area looking better than national statistics suggest. Is there a way to get the app to show both?<br> :date: __2020-12-28 08:12:31__

> HELP! I've been logging every day but today after the 'splash' screen I just get an empty white screen and I can't do anything. Tried killing the app and restarting, uninstalling and re-installing but still no luck.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 12:11:50__

> Won't let me enter previous Covid test info so can't use app. Obviously bug in it or an issue with my One Plus 6 phone??<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:09:33__
