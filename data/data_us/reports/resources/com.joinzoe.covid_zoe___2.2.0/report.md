### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:22:02__

> Initially, I was surprised at how much personal information it wanted...height, weight etc, but then I remembered that it is gathering data about people, related to vulnerability to Covid, and being overweight or obese, is relevant. Around 19th Dec, the notifications to log in daily details stopped on my phone. I did start getting them on my tablet a while ago, so I'm doing them on my tablet. Just a bit worrying that I can't access the app on my phone any more.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 16:43:20__

> Easy to use keeps you up to date with Covid in your local area.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 12:58:30__

> A few seconds per day is all it takes to help very clever people help us all. The more of us that can download this, the more info we have about this beast of a virus!<br> :date: __2020-12-20 12:32:38__

> Normally works well and easy to use but i have had download the app when it just paused and not do anything during the daily update. A worthy app feeding significant covid data back to the analysis.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:09:37__

> Easy to follow and easy to use also no difficulty getting re logged back into app Full marks ðŸ‘Œ<br> :date: __2020-12-20 16:58:32__

> Easy to use .<br> :date: __2020-12-19 21:30:19__

> Great app, thanks for listening to comments both have been fixed. Had to delete all previous comments and fix requests as ran out of words. Keep up the good work.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 20:55:22__

> Great app, if everyone used it we'd all be in a better place.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 18:01:11__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:56:03__

> The app is a good reminder to check in, especially with notifications on. Unfortunately however if you accidentally press certain options it is impossible to go back on some pages, which is quite a flaw. For example, I've never had a Covid 19 Vaccine but the app insists I have.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:39:06__

> I find this app a good source of info and I like the back up email system. But I would like the local information to be clearer as the percentages and per 1000's etc are hard to work out.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 00:56:00__

> Use this app. It's vital! However the recent intro of vaccine use has prevented me from reporting. I made the miatake of saying yes ro vaccine when I've not had one. Please update to allow for error recovery. I cannot change the vaccine flag so it keeps asking me questions about "my vaccination". Hope you can help<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:07:20__

> Haven't been getting reminders for a few weeks now, so keep forgetting to report. Even after several updates. All settings checked (background data, battery saver etc, but still no good)<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:56:17__

> I have used this app daily for months, now after an update it no longer works. A blank white screen is all that I get !<br> :date: __2020-12-19 12:46:32__

> Accidentally clicked that I had a covid vaccine in the app when I haven't and can't find a way to remove it. This is stopping me from report my symptoms without first reporting vaccine symptoms, which I'm not going to do. Please introduce a way to remove this.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 10:43:10__

> Its just not sending out notifications any more, despite uninstalling and reinstalling, then it doesn't seem to register when you do report, so there isn't really any point to it any more. And yes, I've checked the settings. Come on guys, people want to help but you're not making it easy.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 00:00:52__

> Dropped my Android in November, but contacted me with an email.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 18:46:14__

> Worked well for a while then vanished until mid December<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:22:11__

> I used this app for months then suddenly I was dropped. Even though I tried to continue participating, my password wouldn't allow me access. So, I stopped. This morning I received an email from the COVID study asking me to participate again. I had to download the app, establish a new password and finally answer the questions - time consuming. The survey is simplistic and quick to answer, but must be improved so that participants aren't kicked out. This is too important not to work properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:21:23__

> Not really sure how well this app is working<br> :date: __2020-12-18 12:03:25__

> Utterly butterly gutted. The app has stopped its daily prompting.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:23:42__

> Easy and may help in the future. It has now stopped working totally reinstated it, not working White screen then nothing, a shame because it was good.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:14:38__

> Not been getting push notifications for a good couple of weeks, so rarely report now, whereas before I did it every day.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 16:46:24__

> I've been using this app since very early on in the pandemic. Unfortunately it no longer prompts me to complete the details daily. I've checked my notification settings which all say that it should still notify me...but it doesn't. So annoying<br> :date: __2020-12-14 21:51:23__

> Thought it was good to start with then before the end of the first week just kept locking up. Would open and then almost immediately just white screen out so have now decided to delete in from my phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:59:28__

> Message to developers: 250Mb for this app is insane. My phone is full and I need to uninstall some apps. Can't this all be done with a webview?<br> :date: __2020-12-13 14:39:23__

> Was a great app, but like so many other reviewers, I'm no longer getting notifications despite being logged in, so no data is recorded.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 07:35:54__

> Have been reporting since the very start but every day it says I haven't reported . Updated it as instructed and it said I hadn't logged on for 16 days! Started again to remind me to report when I have. Very frustrating. I'm in the North East where number of cases are large and so important that I report . Followed instructions after notification of problems re app but still reminds me to report about 1 hr after me having done so. Not sure if they are actually registering my reports!<br> :date: __2020-12-11 10:56:06__

> Recent update appears to have broken the app. Now loads a blank screen. Hoping for a fix soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:41:57__

> The notifications no longer work after the last android update.. got the email saying you'd fixed it but it still doesn't work for me...help.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 22:30:24__

> Sort out the issues or else I won't be bothered and will delete the app<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:14:34__

> I recently updated the app and now it will not load. Great before, quick and easy to log your health! But now I am faced with a white screen instead.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:36:05__

> Worked ok until 19th December when it just showed a blank screen after loading. Same after updating. Shame but this type of app must be 100% reliable to be useful. Uninstalling<br> :date: __2020-12-20 08:20:34__

> I have no trouble sharing anonymized data, but personal traceable data is right out.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:57:39__

> Latest version doesn't open.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:18:52__

> I was fine with this app and contributed regularly. But now it's log in and password. Not interested sorry. Thanks for all the work you do. Take care.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 14:43:57__

> I have filled out the C19 app since march , then it blanked out. I have just re-installed and can't get pass filling in my address<br> :date: __2020-12-18 19:59:33__

> I used this app religiously every day until it dropped me, as it has many others according to reviews. I tried several times to reinstall, to no avail. I tried to be a "good citizen", but I really believe this app is useless as the data is not necessarily reliable and the weekly extended questionnaire we received was too general and unspecific to be really useful. I've come to believe that this is really nothing more than an exercise to receive grant money.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 18:37:56__

> This app is a complete waste of time. I installed it in order to report on my covic toe, and even though this is one of the prime symptoms of Covid, there is no means of reporting on it. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 11:30:21__

> Cant record daily input anylonger, so uninstalling - sorry<br> :date: __2020-12-15 12:10:02__
