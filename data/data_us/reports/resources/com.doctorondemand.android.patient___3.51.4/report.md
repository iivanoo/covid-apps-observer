## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App doesn't find Insurance providers or show accurate copay information initially. You may need to try couple of times.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:01:43__

> Good knowledge doctors<br> :date: __2020-11-21 17:33:03__

> The application worked well for me. Simple to set up and use.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 17:41:45__

> Finally got it to take my insurance! The quality of care was great, call was a little glitchy.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 18:34:53__

> A little buggy, but still works well.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 16:53:52__

> Easy to use once your all set up, just keep in mind certain things take longer or can't be done via web due to the way it works!<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:11:27__

> Worked good, even gave a reminder text that your appointment was coming up. Didn't have to leave the house...so nice!!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 03:15:54__

> The app worked exactly as it should however the doctor was only able to prescribe a one month supply of my long term medicine, so I will have to schedule a visit at my primary care doctor anyway. If you have a long term prescription, I suggest skipping this app and just calling your primary care doctor instead.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 14:46:27__

> Can be improved<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:46:03__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. It is EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the psychologists.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:07:15__

> Psych will not allow appts for Medicare insured. Also, doctors are not allowed to write prescriptions for controlled substances such as anxiety meds or some psych medications. Should be clearly stated in app<br> :date: __2020-10-28 21:08:45__

> Very First virtual appointment...it was awesome Dr Rachel was very intune and on point....... unfortunately wifi plan cut out prior to the end of second visit a few days later ! So I'm still in need of medication and relief . App/Concept Extremely patient friendly<br> :date: __2020-09-27 19:48:53__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> While Doctor on demand certainly is a lot cheaper than going to a psychiatrist or counselor, those services are still over $200 an hour. During a pandemic, when so many may be needing counseling services, many of us are also still locked down and unable to work, so that price is still out of our reach<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:44:28__

> It was easy to use and quick to get my prescription to my pharmacy. Unfortunately it took way to long to get my doctor's note for work. It has been 3 days. If I don't have it soon, I risk losing my job, because I thought it was a legit, easier and cheaper option than urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:03:23__

> Not what I was looking for<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:32:15__

> Used to love this app when it first came out. It was more affordable for people without insurance or insurance that didn't cover it, $45. Now I see they've gone up to $75 and my current insurance doesn't cover any of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:47:36__

> I absolutely love my doctor. What I DON'T like is that this app screws up appointment availability on a regular basis. They were supposed to message my doctor to explain that the app had no available appointments, which is why I couldn't schedule for the following week. My doctor never even received the message. There are also issues with video quality.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:52:37__

> According to what their customer service just told me, they are for urgent care ONLY. Would only give me a partial refill for a drug that can't be abused, and is used to treat a chronic condition. I suppose they would be a good option as a last resort, so I gave them a generous 2 stars.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 04:10:33__

> She didn't listen to me.CALL AMBULANCE.. Your havingaheartattack. . I have had this many times.. wanted her thoughts.. she wouldn't listen to me .her answer was Call The Ambulance immediately!!! It would be different if I didn't know what was going on.. I needed advice... I wasn't having a heart attack.. you really should LISTEN... sorry but I did not like this person at all!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-29 01:38:46__

> I screwed up and missed my first appointment and now all the money I had left is gone! You'd think an app like this would have some forgiveness and compassion for people looking for help. Total garbage<br> :date: __2020-11-27 20:44:19__

> To expensive<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:03:23__

> I can't find my doctor on here. Very upset<br> :date: __2020-11-26 01:48:29__

> App keeps closing.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 19:10:43__

> Just to be clear, the doctor I have through this app is AMAZING and overall the app is easy to use and very convenient. The one star is for the lack of technical support. There was one occasion where the screen froze and the video call was dropped mid-appointment. Neither I nor the doctor was able to re-instate it and calling tech support was useless (other than getting a refund on my office visit fee) because THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECONNECT AN APPT! What is tech support for???<br> :date: __2020-11-20 01:16:29__

> IT IS 1000% NOT FREE<br> :date: __2020-11-20 01:13:04__

> App keeps kicking. They DO NOT ACCEPT MEDICAID FROM ARKANSAS<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:30:47__

> I needed a dr. Excuse note that I was given corrected to say "I could return to work without restrictions". I missed an entire week because you can't contact the Dr.s. I made the appointment because of severe anxiety at my work. How could the Dr I went to for help make things worse? That was on the 31st. Today is the 17th and I've been waiting 10 days for Papers to be completed so I can get paid for the time I missed. The deadline for the paperwork is the 19th. I will update<br> :date: __2020-11-18 07:20:08__

> Dr did not want to hear what i had to say...very disappointing!! Lost $75 and no meds, wanted me to reschedule for 5 days... NO THANKS I WASTED $75 NOT GOING TO WASTE ANOTHER $75. Much better online Dr services that are cheaper. Dr on demand used to be good but there are better options now, just ask Google, save some money!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-16 15:25:26__
