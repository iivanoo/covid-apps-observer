<br>‚Ä¢             Publicly identify anyone with COVID-19
<br>‚Ä¢             Use your data for any reason other than alerting you that you may be a close contact of someone who is COVID-positive.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I like to help. Thinking I read directions correctly, now it is clear. . . "Use this app for 1 minute a day to make an important contribution to the fight against coronavirus." I don't know about all that, but the simple and straight forward dashboard is slick. Do your part and pray we get through this post-haste! I find it alarming that Kent County, DE is surrounded by higher infection rates, to the north and south. Software that does not suck is Cool.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 13:49:22__

> Will not completely install, just hangs.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 21:43:07__

> Whats the use of downloading a dumb app for covid. Im not a robot that a phone thinks i have covid. I rather go to the hospital now and have a check up for me instead of downloading this app. This app can be dangerous and idk know if you guys are trying to look through my phone and seeing what i am talking about to my bf. I thought the government already have our information for a long. But Nooooo, they want to use this to be deep in our asses. I dont trust this app. Bye!<br> :date: __2020-10-18 22:53:52__

> Wow makes you turn on bluetooth and is a complete invasion of privacy. Stay home and hide if you are scared of COVID<br> :date: __2020-09-28 03:50:29__

> Would like to use the app, but the app always hangs when I get to the data page and click on Continue. I' using a Pixel 3 phone, Android 11.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 16:20:30__

> Perpetually stuck waiting for download from Play Store.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 15:17:02__

> I'm from Maryland but travel to Delaware frequently. This app only works on one of my phone, the others are too old. Please expand the API to include phones down to 4.4. Also less than 100 installs (50+) indicates no one is using it at the time of review. This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less. For this type of app to be meaningful, you need to have engagement > 50% of the population or >500,000% more installs.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 21:09:32__
