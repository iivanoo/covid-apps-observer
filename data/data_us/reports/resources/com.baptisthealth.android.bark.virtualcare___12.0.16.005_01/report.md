## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [https://www.baptist-health.com/](https://www.baptist-health.com/) |
| **Email** | kevin.ehemann@baptist-health.org |
| **Physical address**  | [9601 Baptist Health Drive Little Rock, Arkansas 72205](https://www.google.com/maps/search/9601%20Baptist%20Health%20Drive%20Little%20Rock,%20Arkansas%2072205) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
