<br>IU Health Virtual Visits is a secure, trusted alternative that works with your busy schedule to bring you and your family convenient access to our providers without having to travel to an office. You will interact with our providers via live, high-quality video and receive a diagnosis and instructions for treatment.

<br>• Bronchitis, cold, cough, congestion, fever, flu and other sinus symptoms
<br>• Diarrhea, heartburn, nausea and vomiting
<br>• Cuts, scrapes, sprains, bruises, burns and insect bites

<br>• Infections, including bladder, yeast or urinary tract infection
<br>We also treat conditions such as acne, allergies, asthma, athlete's foot and back pain.
<br>If you use Apple Health, you can choose to share your health information with the provider during your virtual video visit, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose level, weight, nutritional information, and respiratory rate.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app didn't allow for multiple prescription entries and the camera function would not zoom or focus on my ID.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 03:08:45__

> The visits are wonderful. The wait time is loooooonnnnnggggg. And the app kept putting people in front of me while I waited.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 18:39:06__

> Very poor audio<br> :date: __2020-06-09 16:05:13__

> First time. I found things difficult to navigate through the process.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 16:53:23__

> Volume is an issue<br> :date: __2020-05-11 16:49:36__

> Scheduling and the visit itself work very well. Preference fit text message alerts for upcoming appointments doesn't work (always reports an error). No obvious way to view appointment history.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 19:16:53__

> Video quality is not the best.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 18:11:19__

> I had problems with this app on first three uses. IU Health tech support was not helpful when the app failed to connect to doctor. Tech said the app should "just work" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone. Seems like something tech support should have thought to suggest.<br> :date: __2020-02-11 20:07:56__

> I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:06:13__

> Unable to download and reinstall. When installed and opening the application the app kept crashing. I'm on the most recent version of Android. No clue why this is happening. It worked a couple months ago.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 14:27:49__

> What is subscriber ID? Can't get past this question.....<br> :date: __2020-10-10 17:23:02__

> Whenever I went to go and use this app for my doctor's appointment it kept freezing in me in the middle of my virtual doctor's visits that just ones if the things that it would do bad while using this app<br> :date: __2020-09-02 00:46:45__

> Not working.. Says wrong password and I try to reset and I says wrong name and email.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 14:47:41__

> It takes for ever and they even cancel the appointment<br> :date: __2020-08-14 19:56:55__

> No record of visit, not linked to rest of health record. Have had 2 appointments (one for me and one for my child). Neither appointment exist in my app history. When I log into my Health Portal, these visits don't show. During my visit yesterday the nurse practitioner stated they were transferring prescriptions to my pharmacy. My pharmacy doesn't have them and there is no way to verify the appointment even occurred.<br> :date: __2020-06-17 21:55:41__

> Doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-06-16 14:40:52__

> Unable to find appointment reminder. Not user friendly<br> :date: __2020-05-18 06:42:26__

> Spoke to physician. He was supposed to prescribe medication but never called in the prescription. There is no way to go back into the app to follow-up and contact physicians without paying fee again. Flawed app!<br> :date: __2020-05-09 02:05:51__
