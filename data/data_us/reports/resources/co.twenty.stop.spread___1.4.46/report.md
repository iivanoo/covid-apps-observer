## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Updating my review about being unable to put in pin. I had to logout after first making profile and then log back in to use that pin that was texted to me by the app. However I just logged out on my own to see if that would work as there was no indication to so in order to move forward by the app.I was then able to view the results.

> What is my result<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:08:46__

> need check deeper<br> :date: __2021-01-14 16:31:50__

> First, I'm not sure where the problem is? The wife and I had both the Rapid and the Oral Swab done exactly the same time. She had her Rapid results in a couple hours. I never recieved mine? I called the day after and got my results. The text and E-Mail notification was supposedly sent to me, I never recieved anything? This is not the first time. Last year, the same issue? So, if the app is part of the process there is an issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:04:15__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:17:35__

> I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:10:50__

> Does not work with older phones.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 02:14:33__

> Had same problem as prior reviewer. Trying to download app and it keeps hanging at 63%. Too bad. Guess I'll let it sit a while and see if it downloads eventually. :(<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:01:35__

> Unable to get paper copy of report to give employer<br> :date: __2020-12-22 18:47:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:49:30__

> All it does is show results. There is nothing in this app for tracing, etc. All it does is show your results and even that, they only appear hours, day after it is issued. Don't see the point of this app... Really.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:19:49__
