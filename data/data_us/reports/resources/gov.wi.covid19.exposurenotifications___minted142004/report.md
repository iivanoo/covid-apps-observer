### Description
> WI Exposure Notification is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Wisconsin supported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WI DHS). WI Exposure Notification helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the local and tribal public health agencies and DHS. 
<br>Using WI Exposure Notification is voluntary and free of charge. It was built with your privacy and security in mind. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively it can be in helping us contain the virus. 
<br>Once you install and activate WI Exposure Notification and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous signals with other devices. These signals, or keys, are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will remember the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will also record the signal strength, which is used to estimate the distance between two devices, as well as the duration and date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect usersâ€™ privacy, these keys are only kept on the userâ€™s own device. After 14 days, the keys are deleted. If a WI Exposure Notification user tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive a verification code from the State of Wisconsin.  Users must activate the verification code that is only available from the State of Wisconsin in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>WI DHS wants all app users to feel confident that, when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event to be trusted. When users choose to share a positive test result, this notifies other app users that were close enough to the infected person for a long enough period of time (approximately within 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes in a single day) that they are considered a close contact and at risk of infection. 
<br>Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps. WI DHS takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. WI DHS does not need to know where or who you are for WI Exposure Notification to work. The Wisconsin COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/privacy.htm. 
<br>Please note that WI Exposure Notification is intended for users ages 13 and up. The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> I love this App it helps let's me if someone else who has covid-19 this is a cool app to use in case if someone else is exploded to cov-19.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 02:43:14__

> The app sits there and doesn't do much. I haven't received any notifications and I haven't sent any; hope that doesn't change. Does this work with other states or only other people who have this app installed? What do people in Illinois use?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 01:47:32__

> Wonderful app. Since installing the app I have not had the covid. I had concerns about my privacy but since I always wear my medically approved covid mask those concerns vanished since they can't see my whole face. I am also constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands so they can't track my DNA. Wonderful app, everyone should install and take the privacy precautions I do ðŸ˜· ðŸ§´ðŸ§¼<br> :date: __2021-01-10 07:01:51__

> It gave me accurate feedback.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 21:03:39__

> Don't pay any attention to the ignorant Trump Hannity worshipers. This is a useful app that is intended to help protect you and others.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 01:08:54__

> Took long enough<br> :date: __2020-12-31 14:12:35__

> This app fits under the heading 'civil responsibility.' If you care about your family, neighbors and community, you will add this to your phone to help keep them and you safe until we can all get this virus under control.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:48:56__

> I wear a mask because I am a patriot and I care about all lives. Historically Americans provide aid globally for weak and vulnerable, its about time we put America first. Wear your mask. I downloaded this app because I am a patriot and I care about all lives. Using this app may provide valuable exposure information. It will give information to help people know to get tested, to quarantine, or to seek treatment. 2 small steps can save the lives of the vulnerable. That IS the America way!<br> :date: __2020-12-30 15:53:31__

> Under the "Notify Others" tab, I have to scroll down to see the "Share Covid 19 test results" button. Some may not scroll and get confused. The "Share Covid 19 test results" button should be higher on the page.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 20:40:25__

> This is the officially released app you the state of Wisconsin. I was initially uncomfortable with the idea of using this app due to privacy and data collection concerns, but after thoroughly reading the short and straightforward privacy policy I was put at ease of these risks. It seems it does not track your location, just your proximity to other devices.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 20:56:43__

> Great idea, but I have no idea what is or where to find a verification code<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:13:24__

> Haven't been notified that I have been exposed... so no way of knowing<br> :date: __2020-12-28 21:40:11__

> I think this is knocking out all my other blue tooth connected devices. Anyone else having that issue?<br> :date: __2020-12-28 17:22:00__

> It kills your battery due to using bluetooth all the time.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 14:53:28__

> Sounds like a great Idea and im going to try it out for a while but ppl arent going to like the fact that Bluetooth and location hafta be on all the time so not only will it kill everyones batteries but ur going to be followed everywhere you go and to alot of ppl its going to sound like a gov plot to control ppl thru this "backdoor" method!<br> :date: __2020-12-24 12:49:04__

> Seems good so far. I wish it would encourage people to stay home if they are infected. The University app is supposed to be used as a building access pass. If you are positive or have not been tested recently then entry is denied. Seems like a good thing.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 23:05:01__

> THIS APP DOES GATHER AND STORE INFORMATION, HOW ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO IDENTIFY YOU? I love how dumb they make it appear.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 12:45:01__

> It keeps telling me to turn on my bluetooth yet somehow my bluetooth will not turn on. I have uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 05:10:45__

> Never worked not once!<br> :date: __2021-01-17 01:41:59__

> This app developed by Google is totally useless, a waste of tax payer money, and just another way for Google to track your every move from where you've been to when you took your last dump. I've had this app since the first day it became available in Wisconsin, traveled throughout the state several times and not once have I received a notification? With the high case numbers in WI, I find this very hard to believe. Better to wear your mask, stay safe and don't waste your time with this spyware.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 23:05:19__

> didn't find this too useful<br> :date: __2021-01-12 03:58:00__

> The app does not install at all. Please fix it so more people can use this tool to keep our state virus free.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:06:55__

> Don't have any experience. Why are people so positive about this. This app just came out. No one can you really say what's going to happen. Here come the AI filled Dracos.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 00:48:41__

> Evey news story says turn off Bluetooth because that is how people hack your phone. This turns on your Bluetooth forever all day.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 23:28:40__

> App does not allow my phone to connect to other bluetooth devices. Would be useful but have to uninstall since it essentially breaks my Bluetooth.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 15:39:08__

> Do not install this spyware<br> :date: __2020-12-27 05:56:45__
