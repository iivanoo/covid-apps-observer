## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | info@healthytogether.io |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well! Allows me to view my workplace Covid-19 test results in this app!<br> :date: __2020-11-03 00:11:00__

> It is a good app, easy to use. My only complaint is that after I fill out my school's passport, it still notifies me to complete a healthy together survey every day. I wish the passport counted for both.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 15:40:38__

> I think this is a great idea. Hopefully people will continue to download it. I do wish it was easier to figure out how to schedule tests.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 19:14:09__

> Doesn't drain battery badly. I think the question "Have you been tested for Covid19?", should say "Have you been tested for covud 19 in the last 20 days?" Notification for test results come back quicker than my doctor can contact me.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 16:00:57__

> Great app and I have invited everyone in my contacts due to the high necessity to know how healthy the people you surround yourself with. The even better part about this app is the fact that if you allow it to trace you (and you should), it can tell you about other users being sick or testing positive if you've been around them and you don't even have to know the person! I would, however, like it a lot more (or give it 5 stars), if it would update the map of testing areas. A lot missing.<br> :date: __2020-06-27 23:00:50__

> It seems to work really well now.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 19:24:06__

> This is a simple and clear platform for users to check and stay safe during covid. DEVS: Are there Plans to expand this to other states, since most don't yet have a contact tracing app? - from NJ over here, but really like the ease of use the interface is. Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-06-19 20:16:13__

> Could use some work on user interface and ability to add specific dates of positive testing and symptoms instead just on general day. Also, does this work with Google Covid-19 Exposure notifications or just by itself?<br> :date: __2020-06-07 20:53:40__

> App has been working fine & I like that it gives me the locations of free testing but other than that I don't have a use for it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 20:05:35__

> Went really well<br> :date: __2020-05-11 00:10:06__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="3_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="co.twenty.stop.spread 3 reviews"/>
</p>

> Why isn't this app integrated with Google and Apple's covid exposure notification system? Please add support for that.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:53:41__

> Wish the app would send notices for the number of cases in the county at a scheduled time not just a map.<br> :date: __2020-10-03 22:07:45__

> You need to add an option to state nothing has changed since last assessment so you can quickly provide answers. You could even have it show up in the notification as a response. It would really make it much better.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 18:38:18__

> Too wordy for daily use...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 06:38:47__

> Not happy with the app<br> :date: __2020-08-09 17:42:37__

> I want to know where the information goes? Who checks this? Department of health? Or who?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 13:41:27__

> App keeps glitching. I get inturupting notifications requiring action.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 20:01:21__

> Couldnt find the testing place and how to get tested<br> :date: __2020-05-11 23:48:56__

> I think the app should alert you via text message when you come within 6-12 feet of someone who has been exposed and/ or tested.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 03:20:09__

> The app was killing my battery too fast. I had to uninstall. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:47:04__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Haven't seen any information relevant to my personal information yet.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 16:58:40__

> Pretty useless. Tells me to quarantine just because I live with someone who's tested positive regardless of how long ago that was.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 09:35:27__

> This app tells you to get tested for COVID if you have one symptom. Sometimes people have body aches because they did a hard work out. Sometimes people get a sore throat because they are too much sugar. There are other reasons to have some of these symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 22:17:10__

> Does not show the areas of covid on map. Shows absolutely nothing on the map.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 18:37:29__

> I suppose i don't hate it for its functionality. But i do hate how I'm forced to use it, and every time I work out it says i need to get tested because I'm sore and I have to show these results to employers/professors.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 17:56:32__

> Digital contact tracing turned off? This is the apps main feature. I can find mom way to turn it back on. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-08-29 15:34:43__

> The app has killed my battery. It seems like it could be useful, but an app on a dead phone can only do so much.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 23:11:19__

> It's Draining my battery at 45% usage over my other apps and I only use it briefly for one moment of the day. Plus the state of utah isn't using the tracking feature. Please update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 14:47:28__

> This was quickly rolled out, however no serious advertising whatsoever after, therefore no real impact with only a limited user base. Coronavirus is still spreading and could have been mitigated by better contact tracing and aggressive testing.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 19:57:36__

> It needs more white space and adds too many ads. It blocks my work at most inconvenient times with full screen. I removed it and had to add it back to see covid test from hospital. Also no place to record antibody test.<br> :date: __2020-07-18 14:21:26__

> I cant use it iv been trying to Login for an12<br> :date: __2020-11-22 16:19:32__

> Sucked. No real online presence, forced to use phone/tablet, prone to timeouts using without high speed wifi connection resulting in permanent lockout with only a reference to a large medical organization that one evidently has to waste time finding it out. Much better if I could simply go online using a real computer to my medical account to get the results.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 14:48:26__

> I have downloaded it over 5xs & it says installed, but won't open & tells me to re install, but won't because it already is.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 18:19:16__

> Horrible. It's a covid 19 test result that's impossible to access, and instead of emailing us like previously they want to have us "unlock" it. Good to know you can't see if you're positive or negative even after you jump through the hoops<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:45:54__

> Hi I try two times to download the app but I don't see in my cell I received a notification from Florida health department to download the app is just said you will receive the app soon in your cell<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:34:34__

> it forced me to update. Now it won't go back on my phone. Terrible service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 03:25:44__

> After first round of questions the app doesn't give updates, makes you repeat same process each time and when completed questions choices are to edit or cancel. No clear function.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 13:30:56__

> It askes to put in state you put it in and it does nothing<br> :date: __2020-11-11 22:28:33__

> I installed this thinking it works be a good to use but when it would ask how are you feeling and I'd click it to use it, it would only give me an error about it not being available and to try later. I tried about once a day each day and it would do the same for over and over again, sobit being useless, I uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 01:05:42__

> Why the heck is this app not using the official Google/ Apple API???<br> :date: __2020-10-22 00:07:08__
