### Description
> Feeling sick usually happens at the most inconvenient times. However, that doesn’t mean getting the care you need has to be inconvenient too.
<br>You can now have convenient and quality care at your fingertips and even in the comfort of your own bed with the myVirtualHealthVisit app. The myVirtualHealthVisit app provides an easy way to connect with a live provider when it’s convenient for you. You can access a provider in your car, office, or home. A virtual health video visit eliminates time traveling to the urgent care or waiting for an appointment at a doctor’s office.
<br>Receive quality and convenient care on your terms at a time, location, and cost that fits your lifestyle. Urgent care visits on myVirtualHealthVisit cost only $49 or less.
<br>You might be thinking, “When can I use this app—for a sore throat, cough, or headache?” The answer is Yes! Yes! Yes! myVirtualHealthVisit can be used for common conditions such as:
<br>• Upper Respiratory Infections/Flu
<br>• Bronchitis
<br>• Sinus Infection
<br>• Earache
<br>• Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye)
<br>• Urinary Tract Infection
<br>• Skin Disorders
<br>• Back Pain
<br>In addition to on-demand urgent care services, myVirtualHealthVisit now offers scheduled visits across a variety of specialties with many of Suburban Health Organization’s own Hospital Providers. myVirtualHealthVisit is not for emergency or life-threatening conditions, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. If you have a medical emergency, please call 911 immediately.
<br>Now that you have decided to download the app and are waiting for your virtual health visit to begin, you might be wondering what to expect. You can expect to communicate with a provider through a live video and audio chat. The video and audio chat features allow the myVirtualHealthVisit provider to diagnose, prescribe medication, and suggest an in-person follow-up visit, if you need it.  
<br>Your next question might be, “I have a child who is sick. Can I use this app for my child?” The answer is yes! Additionally, as a patient you can invite others to join your video visit (i.e. a spouse, son/daughter of an elderly patient, parent of a college student, etc.)
<br>Along with your care, your privacy is very important to us. Any information that you provide when enrolling, including your personal health and credit card details, is secure. Your visit is private, and any information that you share with the provider is protected in accordance with HIPAA guidelines for patient safety and confidentiality.
<br>myVirtualHealthVisit is also integrated with Apple Health (iOS only), so you can choose to share your health information with the doctor during your virtual visit, including heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, weight, nutritional information, and respiratory rate.
<br>myVirtualHealthVisit brings a provider to you, regardless of where you live in Indiana. myVirtualHealthVisit is a collaboration among Indiana hospitals working together to promote quality, efficiency, and patient access in the communities they serve. Collaborating hospitals include:
<br>• Goshen Health

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> For 2 days I've been waiting nearly nonstop for a physician and have never been connected. The only times which I haven't been waiting are when I'm sleeping or the doctors finally go offline. I don't know if this is due to the app or the doctors, but my experience so far has been horrendous!<br> :date: __2020-03-19 00:04:35__
