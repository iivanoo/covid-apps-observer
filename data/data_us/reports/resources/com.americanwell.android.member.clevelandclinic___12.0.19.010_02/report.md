In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Required patience to be seen, but would SO much rather wait in my home than doctor's office waiting room! Practioner was excellent and I felt genuinely cared for. Definitely worth the $49.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 18:47:13__

> life saver<br> :date: __2020-10-26 10:37:41__

> I had my first visit on May 10 2020. The doctor was fabulous. I just needed an asthma inhaler refill. Walgreens pharmacy said the script didn't list generic as acceptable. Put shortly, it was resolved. However, the inhalers were recalled a few months later. I came back to Express Care to explain I needed a new script. Others need returned. Again, doc was great. What upsets me is getting charged $55. I paid for 2 visits & 4 inhalers unnecessarily. Disappointed<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:10:48__

> Had to re enter things a couple times. I hear they're working on it.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 00:49:25__

> Was hard to hear<br> :date: __2020-09-09 19:01:59__

> Huge bug--video wouldn't come through on my doctor's side!! Please fix it soon.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:27:04__

> Positive once the bugs were worked out.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 16:22:28__

> The doctor was good. The issue I have is if you take too long inputting information after you choose a provider, it will kick you off and say that the provider is no longer available and you have to start over again.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 21:44:07__

> It's a touch laggy but it works.<br> :date: __2020-06-24 16:33:45__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-06-22 17:45:00__

> Connection was weak. Lots of questions to answer.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 02:55:23__

> Very cumbersome. It should connect automatically with my chart so I don't have to answer 1000 questions already on file.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 01:27:51__

> Okay sometimes, but has glitches. Use of third parties in a health care app is not acceptable.<br> :date: __2020-07-25 20:55:49__

> Good all because of doctor!😁<br> :date: __2020-07-08 16:01:32__

> Video froze and reconnected twice during a 20-minute call. Good picture and sound quality otherwise.<br> :date: __2020-06-23 15:25:05__

> Video wouldn't connect, but provider was able to call me directly. Was able to send pictures too.<br> :date: __2020-06-22 15:33:08__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-06-18 03:27:19__

> Dropped call.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 15:37:35__

> It takes way too long to get to the doctor by trying to figure out how to use this.<br> :date: __2020-05-30 00:12:46__

> It would not find my drug store or insurance.<br> :date: __2020-05-28 19:17:10__

> Medicare is not listed Didn't have enough money<br> :date: __2020-07-25 18:16:48__

> Glitchy and doesn't usually connect very well. Definitely prefer Duo to do video calls with my doctors. Love the remote capabilities, but this app just isn't quite cutting it yet.<br> :date: __2020-07-22 19:19:29__

> Got it installed . Will use the app for a virtual appt. With my primary tomorrow.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 00:06:06__

> Being on hold more than two hours finally left<br> :date: __2020-04-08 09:33:15__

> I could hear him but no video came through At all<br> :date: __2020-01-29 22:57:22__

> Get to filling all the paper work out and their connection speed from going to page to page is so slow. Ive been trying make arrangements for like 3 hours now. Hopfefully this app gets better.<br> :date: __2019-10-04 12:47:10__

> unable to transfer my chart to newer phone. can not access my chart from previous phone.<br> :date: __2019-03-22 13:21:20__

> I had connection issues a couple minutes after the appointment started. I disconnected and tried to reconnect, but the app wouldn't let me do that. I ended up just doing the appointment over a phone call, much simpler and more reliable that way.  It's also annoying that it makes you fill out payment info and other forms right when you're supposed to have your appointment, instead of letting you do that in advance.<br> :date: __2017-09-02 05:19:50__

> I have yet to be able to contact anyone on this app and there is no phone number to get help with this app<br> :date: __2016-03-14 15:21:44__

> Slow<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:25:56__

> I tried 3 times to use this, every time when it got to the video it just stopped loading. Total wate of time when I was really sick and needed to see a Dr. That was after it froze numerous times on the beginning screen. I had to reinstall twice and log back in, even call the customer service to reset my password moments after I'd been logged in and it kicked me out.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:45:30__

> Tried to connect 4 times. The app told me I was connected but was waiting for the provider. My appt was cancelled 4 times by the provider. Every time I tried remaking the appointment I had to wait in line, so clearly the problem wasn't with the provider's connection. This app was a giant waste of 1.5 hours of my day.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 21:04:51__

> I can't even open the app anymore. It just crashes outright.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 20:57:21__

> It didn't work the first 3 times because of the video connection. Then made connection video started to work and went out, audio only...only choice was to reconnect and lose my place in line again. Poor app wasted a lot of my valuable time.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 23:16:46__

> MY INFORMATION IS CORRECT!! YET I STILL CAN'T LOG IN!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 04:21:33__

> Terrible. Can't even get set up. Have tried numerous times, just keeps looking for my insurance info...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 21:16:01__

> Terrible! Just awful. You have to reenter everything if you go off the app! The number for help doesn't work! The damn thing doesn't lists all insurance! It's just awful! Worst thing to happen to Cleveland Clinic since parking down town!<br> :date: __2020-08-02 18:46:04__

> Constant issues with downloading the app<br> :date: __2020-05-28 15:53:34__
