## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Avera Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.avera.org](http://www.avera.org) |
| **Email** | averanow@avera.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Everything went well I was able to talk in discuss everything with my doctor. But towards the end I could not hear her hardly at all...she had to write the medicine on a piece of paper and show me so I would know what to get over the counter.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 19:02:43__

> Really liked this "office visit"! I didn't have to hurry through traffic, no fussing with my dog who thinks she needs to come with every time I back the car out.! I still think if you have something you need to have the doctor look at, it is best to go in, but I did enjoy this!!<br> :date: __2020-05-05 15:11:51__

> It would be better if credit card info was asked early on in the process rather than at the very end. It would also be better experience if credit card info could be tied to Google Pay or Apple pay to make it quicker to load payment information.<br> :date: __2020-01-07 13:20:00__

> great app.<br> :date: __2019-07-13 13:17:04__

> I've been seeing my Psychiatrist for over a year, yet I can't send her a message via the app. I've received messages from her office, but I can't respond. Not great for someone dealing with bipolar disorder. FIX IT!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-22 01:47:06__

> This was not thought thru. When I had my first appointment, I had to wait and wait, then I did get through it kept dropping me out then I got a "physician is not available". In, addition, although my phone is Android, I use Mac's at home. The app is not compatible with Mac but only iPhone and iPad. Kind of dumb. No, l et me rephrase that, " kind of stupid". A person should be able to use AveraNow on "all" devices.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 17:51:11__
