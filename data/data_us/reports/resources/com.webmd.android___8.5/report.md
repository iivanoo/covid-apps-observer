## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I really like this app. Keeps me informed about meds I might switch to or others I might need to take with the ones I am on now. Always like reading the post too. FYI to anyone who is reading this and who made WebMD. I tried to open it and it kept rejecting me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and worked. So if having any problems try it. It's like the last update didn't fully install or install right. Hope that helps someone.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 19:12:21__

> Very informative app that I use as a primary and secondary resource for medical applications. Used in support of medical disability issues.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 10:20:57__

> Great for finding out what symptoms can be indicating or treatment at home to help with a illness, injury, or ailment.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 18:32:21__

> Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:52:12__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> Great info🚑🤗🦋<br> :date: __2020-07-08 16:35:23__

> Too many ads<br> :date: __2020-11-16 03:43:46__

> I allow access to my location, it gives me doctors & professions that aren't even close to my area! I put my zip code in & I get nothing! This is ongoing even with updates! Be careful! Stay safe! 😷😷😷😷🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💜💜💜💜<br> :date: __2020-10-27 23:37:12__

> Put in symptoms and it just kept saying I'm diabetic which I'm not but it is does have a lot of info<br> :date: __2020-08-24 06:00:08__

> Cant edit my birthday<br> :date: __2020-08-07 16:48:00__

> Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 15:57:52__

> Hard to put in my health symptoms. Touchy with even short word descriptions. Like trying to crack a code that you know nothing about.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 15:02:31__

> Love this app. Very useful. Had to take off 2 stars because the database is missing many medications and conditions.<br> :date: __2020-06-22 06:31:47__

> Not what it use to be<br> :date: __2020-06-14 07:40:45__

> I am tired of trying to read an article of interest and having interruptions that change what am reading and I can't back to the original article. Either permit to read my article to it's end or I will remove this app.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 15:00:48__

> No notifications after 2 weeks uninstall and reinstall not helped had to download another pill reminder app to track my pills instead shame as webmd is a good app<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:04:35__

> This was updated. Since then, I can't save my medications on the check interactions. We use to be able to do that. Save our medications. That helped me a lot. It helped me remember what not to take together. I have about a dozen medications that I take. I was really liking this. The medication you added, was there until you would delete it. Now, that's not a option at all. What's the clear all needed for, if medications don't get saved. Now, I hate it.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 01:45:09__

> The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:54:00__

> Need to deliver still waiting on my prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-03 01:39:54__

> I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:18:03__

> This was a great app especially with the symptoms checker but now that feature doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 15:26:48__

> I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:02:53__

> I have found that searching for certain terms, such as "dementia", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:13:12__

> Notifications have become political. Delete<br> :date: __2020-10-09 02:43:16__
