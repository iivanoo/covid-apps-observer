### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State’s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

I pray that all people nation wide will Grasps How powerful Gods word is God said " Thou Shall not kill" Its more powerful than the human mind. If every one would realizes that there may be a million laws thousands of rules and regulations, but none of them can do what Gods only Law for man kind /woman kind is Thou Shall Not Kill. This one Law that the Lord require of us is universal peace I'm sick because know one has grasped it. If only all the mass could see and understand. Lightbis understanding everyone should turn on the emergency response team located inside their mind and should early find the beautiful soul inside themselves that can bring Gods word to all life so that thebsick can be healed weather its mentally spiritual are physical. Universal Peace should bebour goals forb 2021 and beyond for if we all obeyed this one simple Law that God is asking us we will have peace of mind body and soul believe it and achieve it Trust God please for God sake's this would be loving each other which is what Jesus said in the beginning AD and in BC it was predicted even unto this day thank you for hearing me out as I thank the Lord for giving me His word that we just can't seem to grasp fully but I pray for you all that this shirt prayer may reach the globe .

> Had to disable Facebook's official app for space to finally install<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:46:34__

> The concept is great! However, it requires everyone to install this app on their phone and must report if get infected. If government couldn't enforce people to wear a mask, I don't think in anyway can make people report if they get infected.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 23:20:53__

> Seems simple enough to use. Turn it on and leave it on. If you receive a notification from app it means you've had a prolonged exposure to someone who reports a positive test. The app doesn't have any means of indicating whether you have the vaccine or not. I think in order to help determine if the vaccine also helps prevent the spread of the virus we should consider adding this data element. Or something to the desired effect.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 17:43:30__

> Excellent app. Thankfully I've never received an exposure alert but I know someone who had, and it allowed them to quarantine to avoid getting others sick.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 06:49:26__

> Super easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-15 00:39:18__

> Sweet<br> :date: __2021-01-14 21:28:31__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-01-11 20:42:47__

> Until people who test positive start entering the verification code into this app nobody will receive any notifications about possible exposure. It's so simple that a fifth grader could probably do it.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 08:59:44__

> Scary times. Thank you<br> :date: __2021-01-10 18:21:55__

> I'm sure it works for the people that don't mind being followed and tracked but I'm not one of those I know how important the viruses but people know enough about my whereabouts and everything else already as it is I'm home enough then I don't need to worry so much and I don't want my Bluetooth turned on all the time so I got rid of this app if I was out in public a lot I would still have it<br> :date: __2021-01-19 07:30:18__

> Intuitive and easy but I don't think enough users to be effective. I'm an ER doc in CA and have had on my phone with bluetooth on fo weeks and haven't gotten a single alert despite knowing for certain that I've been exposed. A lot.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 05:46:47__

> Very helpful 🙂<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:27:24__

> I am happy this app is made now. I have seen many other states have this for a while Anyway I hope this app improving updates with a little more specific information about the exposure. For instance, how far are we from the person who is covid-19 positive? How long ago were we exposed to that person? Also the positive covid-19 is still a little murky because does it mean the person is sick or just asymptomatic carrier? And some more specific information to gauge the severity.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 07:26:19__

> Would be nice to keep track of all negative results as well.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 04:36:15__

> Great Covid-19 app<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:59:37__

> I wish this app had been made available long ago, but better late than never. I'm docking 1 star because there is no way of knowing if it is working. Some other states' apps show the time stamp from the last scan. This app would be improved by adding such a feature to reassure the users that it is working. About GPS- Apparently Android 6+ requires GPS enabled to do a lower energy usage Bluetooth scan. The developers should clarify tha GPS is required, but that location isn't recorded or kept.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 19:56:05__

> The nevada one sux so I had to use an app made by the closest state to me (california). 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️🙃<br> :date: __2020-12-15 12:09:10__

> And will everyone be honest if they in fact contract it? Out of fear of persecution? I hope for the sake of all, we are. AND for everyone tripping on the location ordeal, they have to be able to access the location in order to release accurate warnings. Unless youre a drug dealer, or a fugative on the lam avoiding prosecution from the long arm of the law, what's the big deal? You have something to hide? This is about the greater good, its not only all about you.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 21:14:27__

> This is an honor system app. People who get sick are supposed to self report but this won't work because people are dbags.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 18:39:12__

> I think its great concept but truthfully I haven't had time to use the app. but if it does what it says, it's a 5 star app, and if it saves just 1 life. well how many stars can you put on a humen life. More then the stars in the sky.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 08:12:49__

> Would be decent app if we could install on external drive.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 00:36:43__

> I just installed the app. I see no reason for my GPS to be on when I am at home. My plan is to turn on my phone's GPS when I am in a public place, like the supermarket. I will turn off the GPS when I get back in my car for the drive home. I am giving the app just 3 stars because it's forcing me to leave my Bluetooth on. But I often turn off my phone at night. I hope there's a setting to receive any notifications only during the day. I will have to check that out.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:27:22__

> Not sure what this app is supposed to be doing but as long as it's the virus is not in my area I can live with it<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:54:42__

> Someone showed me their positive result yet it still says that I haven't been exposed. I wear multiple masks and wash my hands frequently, but a careless person could be in danger.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 05:40:18__

> Upd: no help. No word. Did I expect better for installing this and proviso to contribute? surprisingly i did. 2stars remain. Giving this a 2 for intent, my Android version doesn't work. My roomie's version on iPhone works fine. Is there a setting that I can check? Please help app developers.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 21:02:39__

> this will work great if every single family get this app. now, 4 families got infected around my house and the app did not hit any allert<br> :date: __2021-01-18 20:28:51__

> We have several cases of Covid around the corner and the app does not show them. Very disappointed! I hoped this app would help keep my family safe.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 20:16:25__

> App doesn't do much. I think it works off blue tooth and if the other person has their Bluetooth on. I know for certain I've been danger close to numerous people that tested positive with covid-19, but app doesn't recognize that. I assume they need to report it to the app as well . It's a good idea, but requires too many variables to line up.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 10:21:31__

> There has not been any impact. I cannot tell its working. I do not like that you have to have location on all the time. Kills the batt. It sais you dont need location in. Phones have a tracker inside for 911 for your location however there are too much privacy concerns being able to track you all the time. China does and a commy country. I would not be surprised if it does come with the biden admin since that side wants to hold you down.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 02:52:23__

> It only works if infected people input their status. Gov't, testing sites need to take this site over to protect us all<br> :date: __2021-01-10 19:11:06__

> This app has a great goal, but the version I tried on my old-but-still-good-enough Moto G5+ blocked all the Bluetooth sensors I use for workouts and training. All the app needs is a timed pause mode during workouts. Once installed, the only way for me to use my sensors is to uninstall the app!<br> :date: __2021-01-09 20:26:13__

> There have been 4 or possibly 4 confirmed cases at my job site but no alerts.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 21:20:56__

> So far tell me that I am not exposed, when the true it's the opposite, it's not accurate at all, my GPS is on at all times<br> :date: __2021-01-05 09:25:33__

> This app needs the option to report if you have been near another user running this app but not tested positive so you can verify the app is actually doing something. Right now it just sits there and we "Assumbe" its working. I have decided to uninstall this app. It has no test mode to tell me it is even working, eats up excessive battery and it only notifies if you are near someone using this app that has shared that they have covid, and only if near you for 15 min. You can catch it in under 15<br> :date: __2021-01-05 02:58:08__
