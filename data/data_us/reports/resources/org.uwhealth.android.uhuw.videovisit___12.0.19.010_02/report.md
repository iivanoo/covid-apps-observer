## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Ecellent! Dr. Withers is a true professional. Prescribed amoxicillin for my teeth and 72 hour headache that has been getting worse by the day! I have total confidence in UW Health as you have always treated me with respect from day 1. This saved me from going to urgent care. I will be picking up my prescription at Walgreen's as soon as they open today. This has been a terrible last 4 days dealing with this and quite a few of my other ailments.

> The app works great but I happened to be out of state during my video visit so the doctor refused to see me. She said it was considered practicing medicine across state lines which violates her license and that UW was very strict about that. I totally understood and told the doctor to disconnect our call. But that requirement should be made clear in all communications made with patients. Many of us travel extensively for work. Make sure you are in the state when you have an appointment.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 21:19:35__

> Got transferred twice, waited a half hour, and spoke with the rudest doctor. They can't handle common things like ear infections so it's pretty worthless app and process. Coupled with the charge (should be fully covered by insurance) this app and essentially the entire process is useless. If you have a runny nose I guess this might be up your alley, but otherwise it's a complete waste of time and technology for them to offer this service and then not offer care.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 03:10:22__

> Covid19 hotline told me to talk to a doctor immediatly, and i put in my insurance and it still wants me to pay exactly 50 bucks to video chat. America is better than this.<br> :date: __2020-03-30 05:29:22__

> Won't connect me to video chat despite having permissions to do so. Tried twice which took two hours cuz each time I had to wait for a doctor to try to connect which then ended up not connecting and the doctor disconnected. Not what we need in this health crisis! Using android smart phone LG5. Just installed this today.<br> :date: __2020-03-18 20:07:17__
