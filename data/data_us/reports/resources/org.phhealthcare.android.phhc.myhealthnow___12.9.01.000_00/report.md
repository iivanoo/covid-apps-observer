### Description
> Penn Highlands MyHealthNow offers online, 24/7, care you need now from anywhere.
<br>The MyHealthNow free mobile app makes connecting with a doctor fast, easy and convenient. MyHealthNow currently offers provider consults through QCareNow, an on-demand clinic providing evaluation and treatment for minor illnesses or injuries, with new services coming soon.
<br>No appointment is needed to connect with a provider on QCareNow!
<br>The average wait time is less than 10 minutes to consult with a state-licensed health provider. Visits are just $49 and may be covered by your insurance provider. An easily accessible claims receipt will be available after your visit to simplify the reimbursement claims process.
<br>In most cases, you’ll enjoy the convenience of a virtual provider visit with the added freedom to choose from a list of available experts who will provide you with a consultation, and work to diagnose your medical issue, recommend treatment and, if medically-necessary, forward your prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.
<br>When to use MyHealthNow:
<br>• Instead of visiting one of our QCare Walk-in clinics
<br>• During or after normal business hours, including nights, weekends and holidays
<br>• If your primary care physician is not available
<br>• If you are too ill to drive to a doctor’s office
<br>• If traveling and in need of medical care
<br>If you or your child is experiencing one or more of the conditions below, and you are in need of care right now, QCareNow is for you:
<br>• Flu-like symptoms
<br>• Fever
<br>• Vomiting
<br>• Coughs, colds or sinus problems
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Sprains
<br>• Back pain
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Minor eye problems
<br>• Minor cuts and abrasions
<br>• Minor aches and pains
<br>• Bladder infections
<br>• Tick and insect bites

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good but kept breaking up due to poor receorion<br> :date: __2020-07-23 19:12:59__

> Overall a great app, but there was a rather long delay.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 17:37:22__

> Easy to use fast and responsive much better than going in for little things unless you absolutely need to be seen right then and there it's a better alternative. Wait times are still slow but that's with anything nowhere near as long as a hospital would be on average<br> :date: __2020-04-16 21:54:39__

> Was good but cut out quite a bit<br> :date: __2020-04-08 21:50:00__

> Sound isn't very loud. If my house hadn't been totally quiet, I'd have never been able to hear my doctor. Trying to get this app downloaded and set up was a little aggravating but now that I got it done, this is a really neat app! So much better than having to run to the doctor! I can talk to him in the privacy of my own home. This also helps me to remember the things I want to discuss with him.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 19:40:18__
