## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:41:28__

> Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it<br> :date: __2020-10-27 20:39:40__

> There are usually technical glitches - audio, video, failure to connect.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 16:25:13__

> I live in Evansville, Indiana. Which app and portal do I need to use for St Vincents outpatient login<br> :date: __2020-08-04 20:35:13__

> The app has a tendency to drop the connection and can take a while to reconnect. This dropping and reconnecting takes time away feom the patient and provider and is very inconvenient. It also tends to not reconnect the video or freezes up. I don't know how new the app it but it has some bugs that need to be worked out. I have not had a session yet were the app has not dropped everything.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 18:53:45__

> Update 6/19/20: The developer reached out and we just had an online 1:1 feedback/user experience interview. I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:33:43__

> Visit froze 3 times. Kind of irritating.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:44:17__

> Communication not loud enough. Hard to hear and I have good ears other than that it was good<br> :date: __2020-06-10 20:15:31__

> sucks! trying to download it since my laptop had microphone problems, and this still trying to download. I have missed my appointment already. Can they pay attention and fix this issues?<br> :date: __2020-06-04 22:06:40__

> Needs to be updated since its being used more now for scheduled video visits with primary and specialty providers sits more user friendly.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 13:18:13__

> App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the "sent" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 15:34:50__

> Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:42:09__

> App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 15:27:27__

> Keeps freezing an breaking up.hard to hear...<br> :date: __2020-06-02 19:48:36__

> Video Quality is not good at all. There's a huge lag and pixeling issues.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 18:53:55__

> Poor video quality & sound. Distorted video while in use and sound cutting in and out.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 22:22:25__
