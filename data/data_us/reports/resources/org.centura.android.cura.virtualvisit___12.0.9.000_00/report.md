## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Always good to visit with the doctor. I like the fact he try's to keep me accountable. I also like that he don't think a pill is the cure all, he always has a natural healthier alternative. Thanks doctor will talk again in a month.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:04:46__

> It was great! It's very difficult for me to get out, especially in the snow, so this made seeing my healthcare provider much easier. I also live up in the mountains which makes it hard to reach providers in Colorado Springs or Woodland Park. Having this option will make it easier to keep appointments and avoid canceling or rescheduling appointments.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 23:30:48__

> I believe you have a very good interface and navigation. THE MAIN ISSUE: I did not understand that another app needed to be downloaded. My assumption in designing these types of umbrella apps in my career is how to inform the users. From device, operating systems, connections, infor. required, all these moving parts integrated to keep the end user's from feelings of failure, duplication, last min. changes. I did a study the amount of time a consumer will stand in front of an ATM 7.3 sec or leave<br> :date: __2020-11-19 01:09:43__

> Teladoc works as well as any other video chat app. Get in get out get back to bed.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 16:47:20__

> Great Audio, but I could not see my doctor in the video box for my appointment? It would of been nice to have a clear audio and video screen of my doctor for my medical appointments which are very important to my health and well-being. Most importantly, my doctor was able to communicate with me and address everything in regards to my Teleconference appointment this morning. Thank you- TG<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:34:59__

> Great! Easy to use with a little lag time<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:47:51__

> It is ok APP if you need a virtual visit with your doctor who is working for Centura Health.<br> :date: __2020-07-09 21:41:29__

> Very professional but really seemed to care about MY issues<br> :date: __2020-07-01 22:33:58__

> Video freezes, slow to correct<br> :date: __2020-07-01 17:52:34__

> Please add feature so that you can use your phone while on video call other then that the app is simple and easy!<br> :date: __2020-06-30 21:59:14__

> This app is very convenient, and I really enjoy being able to get in contact with my physician without leaving my home. Only downer is that its not compatible with chrome books. I would like to be able to use it on the chrome book, as it's my main 'laptop's. Besides that, I have no complaints.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 22:51:18__

> Fairly well minus this last visit my side of the video was not connecting a picture.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 18:26:24__

> Very survey heavy. One can't just talk to their Doctor, they have to jump through hoops first.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 23:14:05__

> Disconnected twice while in "Waiting Room." Very frustrating for me to have to go back through the whole process of registering for the visit - does the system save my responses when I registered for this appt the first time? WHY, OH WHY do I have to listen to "Katy" tell me how awesome telehealth is. AGAIN?!? Throws off the doctor's schedule while I am logging back in AGAIN and AGAIN to get to the visit. And the screens I see say the doctor canceled my visit. She didn't. This app did.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 19:32:34__

> Worked fine once I got it working, but the doctor's office had a lot of trouble registering me and getting me the initial email<br> :date: __2020-07-08 00:29:04__

> There was a lot of feedback on the audio.<br> :date: __2020-05-29 19:41:40__

> Audio kept cutting in and out. Otherwise easy to use. Got the job done<br> :date: __2020-05-19 00:26:01__

> I've concluded, in an educated way, that 50% of computer programmers are incapable. High paid incompetents at that. Their projects are, essentially, infinite do-loops with no escape. This Virtual Care is a classic example as during a medical PANDEMIC such a medical app should receive the attention of the best of the best, but NO, it is not. Worst of the worst?? What a tragedy. PLEASE find another company to take on completing this app and don't pay for this, heretofore, piece of garbage.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:15:39__

> Terrible and not user friendly!<br> :date: __2020-04-14 08:09:04__

> This is not working on my phone.<br> :date: __2020-03-31 17:51:09__
