## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Beside the low volume we had no other issues.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 12:49:54__

> Dr sarah was awesome. Support is slow to response online, and instead to sort out why pharmacy didn't received prescription, they just asked to wait few hours, which didn't resolve issue. They are responsive and helpful on phone call. Issue was at CVS pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 02:05:35__

> Wonderful insight and caring ways.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 18:53:59__

> I guess its a great app Im just now learning about these Dr.Site Apps you can get a Dr. Over the web now and not have to go in. Before long they will have a scan system on your phone so they can scan your body and see everything. Before or so you dont go to hospitals. Hopefully in the near feuture they can also cure us at home too. Without touching us.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:40:24__

> Very helpful. Nice and friendly. Got most pending issue addressed. It was twice the price of a busy visit copay but I'm too sick to drive so it's worth it. Thanks!!<br> :date: __2020-12-11 23:15:40__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__

> Can be improved<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:46:03__

> Psych will not allow appts for Medicare insured. Also, doctors are not allowed to write prescriptions for controlled substances such as anxiety meds or some psych medications. Should be clearly stated in app<br> :date: __2020-10-28 21:08:45__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> While Doctor on demand certainly is a lot cheaper than going to a psychiatrist or counselor, those services are still over $200 an hour. During a pandemic, when so many may be needing counseling services, many of us are also still locked down and unable to work, so that price is still out of our reach<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:44:28__

> It was easy to use and quick to get my prescription to my pharmacy. Unfortunately it took way to long to get my doctor's note for work. It has been 3 days. If I don't have it soon, I risk losing my job, because I thought it was a legit, easier and cheaper option than urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:03:23__

> Not what I was looking for<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:32:15__

> Used to love this app when it first came out. It was more affordable for people without insurance or insurance that didn't cover it, $45. Now I see they've gone up to $75 and my current insurance doesn't cover any of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:47:36__

> I absolutely love my doctor. What I DON'T like is that this app screws up appointment availability on a regular basis. They were supposed to message my doctor to explain that the app had no available appointments, which is why I couldn't schedule for the following week. My doctor never even received the message. There are also issues with video quality.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:52:37__

> According to what their customer service just told me, they are for urgent care ONLY. Would only give me a partial refill for a drug that can't be abused, and is used to treat a chronic condition. I suppose they would be a good option as a last resort, so I gave them a generous 2 stars.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 04:10:33__

> Multiple cancellations without notice by different doctors<br> :date: __2020-12-22 21:23:27__

> If you choose to have Dr.Kamra Mays as your therapist, be prepared to have your appointment cancelled 3 minutes before your session with no explanation. No phone call. No text. Nothing. Not only is this unprofessional, its inconsiderate. If you do chose to use this app, avoid Dr.Kamra May's.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:33:06__

> Be aware that you run the risk of not getting a diagnosis. You will still pay for advice that isn't helpful to your problem...<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:04:17__

> Have used this app before with zero issues. And then yesterday came and I have an appt. That appointment goes just fine and doctor says she will call me in a script which was the reason for appt - med refill. Usually within less than an hour the full summary is written by doc and posted on app for me and then the script is called in NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED. I have submitted questions for customer service for help and no one answers me. At all. Over 24 hours has passed and radio silence. ......<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:49:48__

> Dr. Phil said that his app covered Medicare specifically Mental Health appointments during the pandemic... it does not cover Medicare! I deleted it immediately it was a lie.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:57:48__

> You have to be sick 10 days before get some real meds. In the meantime spend money for OTC medicines that don't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 00:13:14__

> App won't download! The app stays in pending status and then errors out. I made sure it wasn't my phone by downloading another app and checking space and it isn't my phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 10:32:19__

> App sucks... The provider does not have enough control when it comes to scheduling. So if you get one you like and others like you'll end up losing your time bc someone else took it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:09:56__

> Why cant i get this to downlaod Ive tried many times and it wont go<br> :date: __2020-12-16 00:09:52__

> Dr told me being abused as a kid and getting anxiety is my fault and should increase effexor regardless of withdrawal symptoms. Absolutely rude and ignorant<br> :date: __2020-12-15 17:20:08__
