## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A little laggy<br> :date: __2021-01-16 17:04:05__

> Very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-15 22:47:07__

> App has shown much improvement since its first release. It was initially clunky and broken in places, but now it works smoothly and I was able to see a doctor relatively quickly.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:50:29__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:28__

> Once able to get to the provider. Very efficient. Now the process to get there needs some work. If I was able to rate each aspect. The app would get 1.5 stars. And the Dr. 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 03:24:51__

> Each time I have used the app, I have had a positive experience. All of the physicians I have seen this past year were very attentive, nice, and answered my questions. I just wish there was a better way to followup with the doctor regarding questions and prescriptions.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 01:11:45__

> Besides the expensive co-pay cost, good care.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:13:58__

> Very helpful info<br> :date: __2021-01-01 01:21:01__

> My first visit was years ago and it was ok, but I'm not a fan of telemedicine. The 2nd was disconnected before it even got started, so I went back in and set up a same day appointment. Third times a charm. Although I'm still not a fan of telemedicine, it is better than urgent care or emergency room in non-emergency situations.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:27:21__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-24 19:08:19__



#### 3-star reviews

</p>

> Limiting treatment options and appointment options.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 19:15:09__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.doctorondemand.android.patient 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> While Doctor on demand certainly is a lot cheaper than going to a psychiatrist or counselor, those services are still over $200 an hour. During a pandemic, when so many may be needing counseling services, many of us are also still locked down and unable to work, so that price is still out of our reach<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:44:28__

> It was easy to use and quick to get my prescription to my pharmacy. Unfortunately it took way to long to get my doctor's note for work. It has been 3 days. If I don't have it soon, I risk losing my job, because I thought it was a legit, easier and cheaper option than urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:03:23__

> Not what I was looking for<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:32:15__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Poor customer service. Poor quality care.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 09:58:50__

> Looks good on the surface, looks ARE deceiving. After your first or second appointment you won't be able to schedule with any regularity. This company had a lot of potential, but what an amateur organization.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 03:12:03__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-01-11 15:25:04__

> They haven't answered me<br> :date: __2021-01-10 22:34:11__

> Would not accept my insurance. Didn't bother going any further.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 16:36:18__

> No connection<br> :date: __2021-01-03 07:56:50__

> I had to cancel my appointment due to an emergency 17 hours before the time I had scheduled. I wasn't able to reschedule it because they have a 24 hour rule and thats completely understandable. Except for the fact they'll still charge me $300 for an appointment I couldn't make or reschedule and now I can't afford to see a doctor at all. What a way to ring in 2021.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:27:28__

> Terrible absolutely ridiculous! Received no help at all! I will never use this app again! If I could of not given any stars to post this I would of.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 05:30:26__

> All they want is your CC# when your insurance company covers everything this is a SCAM!!!?<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:29:22__

> Terrible. I made 2 appointments today. The first was ended automatically as soon as it started with no reason. The 2nd I waited for 15 minutes to then get connected with black video screen to then have that end automatically too. Waste of time. Not sure if there are better alternatives, but anything must be better than this. Especially if you value your time.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 02:03:43__
