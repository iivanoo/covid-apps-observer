## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Doctors demand is very helpful when you're unable to get into your doctor to and you don't want to have to go to the emergency room so definitely appreciate having that service available.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 01:42:29__

> My work pays for my services. The setup was relatively easy. The Dr. Was courteous. He was able to make an assessment and the video was clear. Saw a different doctor she was very helpful.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 22:00:39__

> Everything but choosing a pharmacy worked fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:33:52__

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__

> Limiting treatment options and appointment options.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 19:15:09__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__



#### 1-star reviews

> Horrible scam. You are paying to consult. No diagnosis or prescriptions.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:01:50__

> I am setting new passwords and they are refused<br> :date: __2021-01-26 23:06:51__

> Worst experience ever!! Doctor arrived late to our video call. I could not see the doctor, video was snowy and I had to ask the doctor to repeat herself over and over again. The doctor said she had to refresh her side of the call over and over again. No advice was given or medication. Customer Service is no help at all. No warning to the end of the call. Say clear of this application. Don't get robbed like I did. Doctors are suppose to help people, not rob them.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 23:30:12__

> Unusable. Click for a visit, asks you who for but doesn't give the option to answer. So your just stuck there.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 15:37:58__

> Gave my wife the wrong prescription and wouldn't fix their mistake! We are trying not to go into Dr offices because we have a premie baby at home. So when my wife had a terrible earache we thought we could rely on Doctor On Demand to help us. Their Dr wrote the Rx for the wrong medicine...and then couldn't be reached to fix it. We had to pay an ADDITIONAL $75 to get to get some simple eardrops. They have refused to credit us for the wrong Rx. I caution everyone to avoid this company!<br> :date: __2021-01-24 16:12:10__

> Forces you to give up your location data even if you're going the telehealth route. Completely useless app.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 15:28:35__

> I made 4 appointments in advance immediately after my first session, and none of them are there. I showed up for my next appointment and there's nothing to show up to. None of the dates are available anymore. I'm extremely upset over this, I have a short time frame I can get this done and now I may have to change my therapist because he is booked.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 15:24:37__

> Not helpful at all... just recomed you covid test for any and all symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 03:14:14__

> HORRIBLE exp. with this app. Took 2 hrs and 4 different tries to register then "5-10" minute wait was actually 80. Bug in app twice reset several things on my phone including disabling my keyboard. 2 hrs from start the Dr. came on but couldn't see or hear me. Rescheduled 4 hours later. Dr. was professional but failed to send rx for antibiotics she said I needed. Finally, I left a negative review yesterday and it's missing and I'm still repairing bug damage. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HIGH RATING.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 19:28:39__

> Good luck entering your insurance information in. I've had to actually call the company every time because the app isn't capable of basic data entry.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:22:27__
