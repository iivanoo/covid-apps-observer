## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My work pays for my services. The setup was relatively easy. The Dr. Was courteous. He was able to make an assessment and the video was clear. Saw a different doctor she was very helpful.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 22:00:39__

> App worked fine but the customer service messaging is absolute horsesh&t. I left 3 messages and waited days for a response. I then called the phone number. I was quickly able to get a real human on the phone who told me I had to wait days for a response. All this was just to replace a 4 day supply of antibiotics I recieved from the Dr. A 4 day supply that was as you can imagine pretty time sensitive as most courses of antibiotics are. So my only other option was to pay another $75 fee.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 20:45:47__

> Money hungry just like all the other docs....gave meds 2 days, weren't working. Called support because there is no way to call the doc you saw. Told me I'd have to pay ANOTHER $75 to get a med change!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:13:46__

> Everything but choosing a pharmacy worked fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:33:52__

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> No callback or reconnect function of your internet drops during the call so you have to reschedule for the next appointment which could be days or weeks away very unprofessional for an app in 2021<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:49:18__

> Filter needs more detail. I cant put location in and other details.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:09:42__

> They give me wrong info i ended up having sergey instead<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:20:52__

> Visit was easy and fast but I can't get the prescription they filled for me because my pharmacy said the directions were "unclear" I sent a support message immediately after and I'm still waiting to hear back. I am out of this medication so I hope they can get back to me quickly.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:01:24__

> Doctors are great!! Super nice and always so helpful! Usually never a long wait. But don't ever have any questions to submit to the support team. I have message multiple times with no reply. Literally week 3 of no responses. I need a doctor's note for work, the doctor forgot to send it to me. I reached out January 15 for one, and nothing no responses at all.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:10:21__

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> The doctor is great. Everything else is lousy. Inability to communicate with doctor, tech support is lousy, poor customer service. I wish someone with power to change process and improve software would contact me. Its got a ways to go.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 22:27:22__

> The doctors etc available are great but you cannot contact them if you have questions or need immediate assistance with a prescription they prescribed. Support said they would call within a few hours but it has been days. Edit: reached customer service, they were so inept they forgot what I was talking about and reissued a prescription in error that I know have to call the pharmacy to cancel. They refuse to acknowledge that their automatic reply system is flawed and dangerous. Don't use this app<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:26:32__

> Crazy expensive<br> :date: __2021-02-07 13:55:25__

> Just a shame.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 19:42:28__

> horrible absolutely the worst I've ever do not waste your money! something like this should be offered to everybody not just a selected few people that have money! If you have Medicare or Medicaid Dr Phil Does Not care who are considered poor and you don't qualify for this app. just an FYI: you see how he really wants to help people. Help the people who need it instead of making more money care about the less fortunate... Sincerely, Paralyzed/Quadriplegic<br> :date: __2021-02-01 22:51:20__

> Very bad<br> :date: __2021-02-01 04:35:44__

> Won't let me add my insurance in. Says it can't contact them?<br> :date: __2021-01-31 15:14:20__

> Horrible scam. You are paying to consult. No diagnosis or prescriptions.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:01:50__

> I am setting new passwords and they are refused<br> :date: __2021-01-26 23:06:51__

> Worst experience ever!! Doctor arrived late to our video call. I could not see the doctor, video was snowy and I had to ask the doctor to repeat herself over and over again. The doctor said she had to refresh her side of the call over and over again. No advice was given or medication. Customer Service is no help at all. No warning to the end of the call. Say clear of this application. Don't get robbed like I did. Doctors are suppose to help people, not rob them.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 23:30:12__
