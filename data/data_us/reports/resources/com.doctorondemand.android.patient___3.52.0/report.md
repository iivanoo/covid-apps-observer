## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great<br> :date: __2021-01-09 16:28:33__

> Very VERY convenient!<br> :date: __2021-01-09 11:52:35__

> Great service keeps me from having to go to hospital during covid to get refills<br> :date: __2021-01-09 08:15:36__

> Ive used this once. Everything went well. I don't have health insurance right now and figured paying the 75 dollars would be cheaper than actually going to a doctor's office. The visit was short and sweet. The doctor was very polite and comforting. I was being seen for possible covid-19 symptoms, the doctor ordered a test and sent me a not to send to work, both documents were delivered to the app while I was still on the call with her. I will probably use this service again in the future.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 04:13:25__

> Very quick and helpful service.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 01:58:52__

> Best experience, friendly fast and took care of my needs<br> :date: __2021-01-09 01:36:43__

> Love it! Easy to use and incredibly convenient. When my insurance approved introduced it I was sceptical, but it's the best thing that they've ever given us.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 01:33:44__

> Great communication and knowledge.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:17:58__

> Each time I have used the app, I have had a positive experience. All of the physicians I have seen this past year were very attentive, nice, and answered my questions. I just wish there was a better way to followup with the doctor regarding questions and prescriptions.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 01:11:45__

> Besides the expensive co-pay cost, good care.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:13:58__

> Very helpful info<br> :date: __2021-01-01 01:21:01__

> My first visit was years ago and it was ok, but I'm not a fan of telemedicine. The 2nd was disconnected before it even got started, so I went back in and set up a same day appointment. Third times a charm. Although I'm still not a fan of telemedicine, it is better than urgent care or emergency room in non-emergency situations.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:27:21__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-24 19:08:19__

> So far so good. I am still waiting for a good general physician.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 17:16:03__

> Beside the low volume we had no other issues.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 12:49:54__

> Dr sarah was awesome. Support is slow to response online, and instead to sort out why pharmacy didn't received prescription, they just asked to wait few hours, which didn't resolve issue. They are responsive and helpful on phone call. Issue was at CVS pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 02:05:35__

> Great doctor but glitchy video.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:16:15__

> Amazing. Fast. Free.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 17:59:29__

</p>

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__



#### 2-star reviews

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> While Doctor on demand certainly is a lot cheaper than going to a psychiatrist or counselor, those services are still over $200 an hour. During a pandemic, when so many may be needing counseling services, many of us are also still locked down and unable to work, so that price is still out of our reach<br> :date: __2020-11-23 17:44:28__

> It was easy to use and quick to get my prescription to my pharmacy. Unfortunately it took way to long to get my doctor's note for work. It has been 3 days. If I don't have it soon, I risk losing my job, because I thought it was a legit, easier and cheaper option than urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:03:23__

> Not what I was looking for<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:32:15__

> Used to love this app when it first came out. It was more affordable for people without insurance or insurance that didn't cover it, $45. Now I see they've gone up to $75 and my current insurance doesn't cover any of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:47:36__

> Would not accept my insurance. Didn't bother going any further.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 16:36:18__

> No connection<br> :date: __2021-01-03 07:56:50__

> I had to cancel my appointment due to an emergency 17 hours before the time I had scheduled. I wasn't able to reschedule it because they have a 24 hour rule and thats completely understandable. Except for the fact they'll still charge me $300 for an appointment I couldn't make or reschedule and now I can't afford to see a doctor at all. What a way to ring in 2021.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:27:28__

> Terrible absolutely ridiculous! Received no help at all! I will never use this app again! If I could of not given any stars to post this I would of.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 05:30:26__

> All they want is your CC# when your insurance company covers everything this is a SCAM!!!?<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:29:22__

> Terrible. I made 2 appointments today. The first was ended automatically as soon as it started with no reason. The 2nd I waited for 15 minutes to then get connected with black video screen to then have that end automatically too. Waste of time. Not sure if there are better alternatives, but anything must be better than this. Especially if you value your time.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 02:03:43__

> Multiple cancellations without notice by different doctors<br> :date: __2020-12-22 21:23:27__

> If you choose to have Dr.Kamra Mays as your therapist, be prepared to have your appointment cancelled 3 minutes before your session with no explanation. No phone call. No text. Nothing. Not only is this unprofessional, its inconsiderate. If you do chose to use this app, avoid Dr.Kamra May's.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:33:06__

> Be aware that you run the risk of not getting a diagnosis. You will still pay for advice that isn't helpful to your problem...<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:04:17__

> Have used this app before with zero issues. And then yesterday came and I have an appt. That appointment goes just fine and doctor says she will call me in a script which was the reason for appt - med refill. Usually within less than an hour the full summary is written by doc and posted on app for me and then the script is called in NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED. I have submitted questions for customer service for help and no one answers me. At all. Over 24 hours has passed and radio silence. ......<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:49:48__
