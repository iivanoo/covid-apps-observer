## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Called back and now they tell me they cant help me unless I pay another 75$ dollars for a visit. My transmission just went out and I have to go into debt paying 2800$ and the customer service for Doctor on demand isnt helping at all<br> :date: __2021-01-22 23:24:42__

> Very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-15 22:47:07__

> App has shown much improvement since its first release. It was initially clunky and broken in places, but now it works smoothly and I was able to see a doctor relatively quickly.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:50:29__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:28__

> Once able to get to the provider. Very efficient. Now the process to get there needs some work. If I was able to rate each aspect. The app would get 1.5 stars. And the Dr. 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 03:24:51__

> Each time I have used the app, I have had a positive experience. All of the physicians I have seen this past year were very attentive, nice, and answered my questions.

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__

> Limiting treatment options and appointment options.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 19:15:09__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Pretty good but couldn't contact Tricare<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:37:31__

> This app is great if you need a therapy session or a prescription refill, but if you're actually seeking medical advice, this is probably not your app. I've tried 2 doctors through this app and all both wanted to do was rush me through (neither $75 appt lasted more than 7 minutes) and wrote me a prescription. The doctors in this network are probably just starting their residencies, so they don't have enough experience to do anything more than hand out pills and referrals to real doctors.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:38:00__

> Great providers. But the app is not so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:48:33__

> Not a good fit for the care I need.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:51:08__

> Basic needs are great... The DOD company needs to make it so the doctors only have X amount of spots for new patients and a way for existing patients to get their follow ups. Therapy doesn't work if it isn't consistent. A trust and reporte needs to be built to make progress. Its EXTREMELY difficult to get follow-ups with the therapists for kids any kind of kid appts are difficult to make. Using the app is time consuming. It takes forever to load. The doctors are amazing.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:56:32__

> HOW CAN I GET IN COTACT WITH SOMEONE FEOM THE APP, the questions there asking me some i have, my mom, dad, i dont see opetionsa for grandparents or aunts or uncles??? wats up with that. my conditions are know run in my family and all o want is help<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:51:19__

> Forces you to give up your location data even if you're going the telehealth route. Completely useless app.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 15:28:35__

> I made 4 appointments in advance immediately after my first session, and none of them are there. I showed up for my next appointment and there's nothing to show up to. None of the dates are available anymore. I'm extremely upset over this, I have a short time frame I can get this done and now I may have to change my therapist because he is booked.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 15:24:37__

> Not helpful at all... just recomed you covid test for any and all symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 03:14:14__

> HORRIBLE exp. with this app. Took 2 hrs and 4 different tries to register then "5-10" minute wait was actually 80. Bug in app twice reset several things on my phone including disabling my keyboard. 2 hrs from start the Dr. came on but couldn't see or hear me. Rescheduled 4 hours later. Dr. was professional but failed to send rx for antibiotics she said I needed. Finally, I left a negative review yesterday and it's missing and I'm still repairing bug damage. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HIGH RATING.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 19:28:39__

> Good luck entering your insurance information in. I've had to actually call the company every time because the app isn't capable of basic data entry.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:22:27__

> Made an appointment only for the doctor to tell me I'm the last 5 minutes that they can't help me with what I had made the appointment for and denied a refund. They can scam you if they really want to.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 15:34:18__

> Does not work as described.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 05:21:03__

> Trash. After complete register and asking 100 questions they want 75 dollars just to talk to someone.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 19:58:54__

> I paid $75 to see a doctor and was told to go see a doctor in person, when I asked for a refund they said they could not since they provided clinical advance since they advised me te go see a doctor in person<br> :date: __2021-01-17 18:17:32__

> PRICE RAPE<br> :date: __2021-01-17 13:26:10__
