### Description
> PathCheck (formerly COVID Safe Paths) can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available. 
<br>Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>We are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.
<br>The PathCheck program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck Foundation, established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the PathCheck app and associated tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities. 
<br>The goal of PathCheck is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Made with privacy at its core.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 04:32:14__

> One of the very few safe and privacy-centric contact tracing app.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 04:31:47__

> I like that any location data stays on my phone until I give permission to export it to a health care worker and that it is then anonymized. Looks a lot less intrusive then all the targeted advertising that tracks me and a lot more useful, in my opinion. Cool looking app. Now just waiting for my health department to integrate it.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 01:51:35__

> No instructions how to use! I have no idea where to get the "healthcare authority" URL the app asks for and therefore receive nothing about COVID in my area.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 11:44:15__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-05-14 07:35:03__

> Do not download this app, search "Covid Safe" with a space between the words to get the actual Australian Government app.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:29:56__

> NOT THE AUSTRALIAN GOV APP<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:05:25__

> Not the app endorsed by the government<br> :date: __2020-04-26 23:34:36__

> The app developers need to make it clear this isn't the official government app. It's irresponsible for them to position this in the store knowing people are searching for the Govt App. To find the Govt App search "Covid safe" as two words and look for the official green logo distributed on well know public news sources.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 11:11:39__
