### Description
> COVID Alert NJ App is being made available by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) to complement New Jersey‚Äôs comprehensive COVID-19 contact tracing effort. COVID Alert NJ is a free and secure mobile phone app that allows New Jerseyans:
<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 ‚Äì even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 ‚Äì especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of New Jersey  Applications |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html](https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html) |
| **Email** | COVIDapp@doh.nj.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> The adaptive icon randomly becomes a square.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:52:55__

> This app needs improvement. When you get an exposure alert it doesn't tell you the date of exposure, just that it was within the past 14 days. So you could already be out of the quarantine period or only need to test and isolate for a few days. Giving the date of exposure seems important.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:25:46__

> I Certainly can't actually Rate something I just got.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:11:50__

> Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 04:34:50__

> This app collects daily data well enough, BUT IT GIVES LITTLE INFO THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE!! PLEASE IMPROVE IT!!! - County-level % is % of STATE!! USELESS!! WHAT'S IMPORTANT is the current 7 day positivity testing rate!!! - NOT BY COUNTY, BUT BY MY CURRENT LOCATION!!! - EVEN BETTER: GIVE THE % POSITIVITY WITHIN A 1,5,10,25 MIKE RADIUS!!! THIS WAY, PEOPLE CAN MANAGE RISK!!! - YOU HAVE THE GPS COORDINATES OF EVERYONE, SO YOU CAN DO THIS!!! WHY DON'T YOU????<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:25:32__

> Just really want to know if the app talks to the NY and PA apps? I deal with people from both daily.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:15:30__

After doing this I turned on my wifi no problem, but my malware scanner detected the NJ COVID ALERT as malware due to I guess the access to Bluetooth.

> I tested positive yesterday, but there is no way to tell the app. I can only report symptoms. Apparently I need a 6 digit code from some health department to let the app know I was positive. So until I get that code nobody who was in proximity to me will get a notification and will therefore keep spreading the 'rona.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:32:23__

> Absolutely worthless. Contracted covid from a person that contracted covid while in hospital. The contact tracer was not able to get the 6 digit code I needed for the app. Also Drs are refusing to test likely positive people. There's no way to use the app as intended without a test or a code, don't bother with the invasion of privacy.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 07:40:54__
