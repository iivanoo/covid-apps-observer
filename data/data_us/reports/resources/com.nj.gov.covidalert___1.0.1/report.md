### Description
> COVID Alert NJ App is being made available by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) to complement New Jersey‚Äôs comprehensive COVID-19 contact tracing effort. COVID Alert NJ is a free and secure mobile phone app that allows New Jerseyans:
<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 ‚Äì even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 ‚Äì especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of New Jersey  Applications |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html](https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great<br> :date: __2020-12-26 05:17:55__

> I feel like if more people used this app it could help in lowering the cases in NJ. So the app senses if you come in contact with somebody that has covid. I have not ever been contacted so I'm not really sure if enough ppl are using the app or if I have been really lucky. Im pretty sure more people need to have the app in order for it to make a difference.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 05:38:20__

> To work everyone needs to use it, otherwise you could be exposed by someone who doesn't use this<br> :date: __2020-11-16 23:15:37__

> I think the app is great. Very informative. It's all in one spot. You do not have to have bluetooth on all the time. You can switch it on when you would like to use it then switch it back off. Without bluetooth you are still able to access and use all of the other features like covids daily numbers local/global/etc and also you are able to check in with how you are feeling and report symptoms..just another tool in the fight against covid.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:56:28__

> Graph of deaths by day is very wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 18:14:31__

> The numbers for confirmed cases and deaths are wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 21:33:16__

> The adaptive icon randomly becomes a square.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:52:55__

> This app needs improvement. When you get an exposure alert it doesn't tell you the date of exposure, just that it was within the past 14 days. So you could already be out of the quarantine period or only need to test and isolate for a few days. Giving the date of exposure seems important.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:25:46__

> Rite aid Cov 19 testing<br> :date: __2020-12-13 15:43:07__

> I Certainly can't actually Rate something I just got.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:11:50__

> Works ONLY: #1. If an infected person ALSO has the APP and you both have Bluetooth &. Location turned on. And #2. You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert. Good for crowds etc.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 04:34:50__

> This app collects daily data well enough, BUT IT GIVES LITTLE INFO THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE!! PLEASE IMPROVE IT!!! - County-level % is % of STATE!! USELESS!! WHAT'S IMPORTANT is the current 7 day positivity testing rate!!! - NOT BY COUNTY, BUT BY MY CURRENT LOCATION!!! - EVEN BETTER: GIVE THE % POSITIVITY WITHIN A 1,5,10,25 MIKE RADIUS!!! THIS WAY, PEOPLE CAN MANAGE RISK!!! - YOU HAVE THE GPS COORDINATES OF EVERYONE, SO YOU CAN DO THIS!!! WHY DON'T YOU????<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:25:32__

> Just really want to know if the app talks to the NY and PA apps? I deal with people from both daily.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:15:30__

> Even though I have exposure alerts on it seems to only do a scan if I open the app itself. Shouldn't it do this automatically daily?<br> :date: __2020-11-05 15:15:12__

> I work at a busy congenial store, and have had the app installed for a few months now. I find it really improbable no one infected with the app has walked into the store.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:23:10__

> Difficult to navigate<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:37:09__

> I am not leaving my Bluetooth on everywhere I go which isn't far but this will take a long time to get enough peoples info and get them on board before you can do that! Ifmt feels intrusive as well. Never leave your Bluetooth on unless you know what your hooked up to.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 21:08:54__

> Unfortunately b cause of the blue tooth ne don't to be on it has caused issues with my phone. In which I have issues turning off and or turning on manually the bluetooth. It has also cause phone to lock up. This is causing issues with hands free calling. Uninstalled app.<br> :date: __2020-10-27 21:13:14__

> In order to install app I was to turn off my wifi during install and my malware scanner. After doing this I turned on my wifi no problem, but my malware scanner detected the NJ COVID ALERT as malware due to I guess the access to Bluetooth. I will try it for a week and decide weather to keep it<br> :date: __2020-10-11 16:57:02__

> I tested positive yesterday, but there is no way to tell the app. I can only report symptoms. Apparently I need a 6 digit code from some health department to let the app know I was positive. So until I get that code nobody who was in proximity to me will get a notification and will therefore keep spreading the 'rona.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:32:23__

> Absolutely worthless. Contracted covid from a person that contracted covid while in hospital. The contact tracer was not able to get the 6 digit code I needed for the app. Also Drs are refusing to test likely positive people. There's no way to use the app as intended without a test or a code, don't bother with the invasion of privacy.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 07:40:54__

> Your "ENABLE EXPOSURE ALERT" button has not worked since its launch. Gone into settings > exposure alert > enable and NOTHING. Have an Android phone but know of iPhone users with the same problem. Located in Morris County, NJ. PLEASE FIX THIS!!<br> :date: __2020-12-22 14:24:30__

> Not very helpful. I've NEVER been alerted of being or coming into contact with someone whose known to have covid19. This app is just an invasion of my privacy!<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:53:27__

> When the Middlesex Co health dept called me 6 days after my + test, the woman I spoke with knew about the app, but knew nothing about giving me a 6 digit verification code. If it's not her job to give it out (as the app says it is), then whose it is? This app isn't working the way it claims to be. If people can't tell the app they're + then no close contacts are being alerted through the app. Why does the health dept (at least Middlesex Co) not know to give out this code?<br> :date: __2020-12-12 08:37:45__
