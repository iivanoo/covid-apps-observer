## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is the best so easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-09 13:53:21__

> If you dont have this, i hope your affairs are in order! The warnings and notices are timely and accurate (for now, we'll see how Mr Biden tweaks things)<br> :date: __2020-12-09 03:49:42__

> This is a must have app! Download and check it out for a month or two. This is one app that will always be on my phone!<br> :date: __2020-12-07 08:19:38__

> Seems to be pretty decent. I live in Texas, so I already have apps for weather/tornado warnings. This app has alerts for other life threatening things like disease and nuke power plant failures. I watch less and less TV these days, without this app I might not know about these other alerts. It's simple to use, and thankfully, seldom used. Lets all hope it stays that way. Thanks for the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 21:12:50__

> So I love this app, but I feel as if you guys should check the reviews. There are people there with legitimate concerns, and some great recommendations that your should take look at. Such as: -Missing Alerts -A "Follow Me" option. -A priority alert mode (that fully covers your screen when you get a warning alert). I had a tornado warning in my area, and I love that I recieved it when using the app, but you should force the users to see a warning. These are the 3 options I'd love to see come.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 03:51:39__

> It has a lot of information anyone would ever need in this nation you could help you self and others in anything<br> :date: __2020-11-25 07:22:21__

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Great app !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 02:06:16__

> Overall decent, but I don't need 17 alerts in one hour for the same storm.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 01:10:21__

> It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 22:57:25__

> Fast reliablie services<br> :date: __2020-07-09 01:04:27__

> Great app.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 08:50:11__

> Great at giving alerts for different areas. Live posting during storms is excellent. Just be careful you don't list to many places to avoid constant updates.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 03:22:06__

> Not as helpful as before<br> :date: __2020-12-28 07:32:52__

> They did not explain what she was asking me about and was real short with me . To me she was rude but I need my house fixed not TVs or other stuff like that but thank you for what you did do.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:49:29__

> Also I build homeless shelters and I think this would be the place to add my location make it official<br> :date: __2020-10-06 07:13:34__

> Works but would multiply the same alerts<br> :date: __2020-10-03 19:46:59__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a "no wifi" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 18:35:21__

> Not enough details on alerts. Not worth the space on my phone<br> :date: __2020-09-11 00:11:01__

> Difficult to navigate and doesn't provide info I expected<br> :date: __2020-09-06 08:45:22__

> The type is thinner and less legible with this update. The unnecessary style change reduces its usefulness to me. Plus, I have not received alerts about the smoke in my area or the fires near me although I specified that in the settings. So I uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-08-21 06:13:51__

> No notification alarm!!<br> :date: __2020-08-13 18:12:50__

> where's the warnings I used to get<br> :date: __2020-06-24 02:29:53__



#### 2-star reviews

> Super irregular performance and notifications. I cannot rely on this for requested information or results<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:22:01__

> Need more control over types of alerts. Don't need to be woken from deep sleep at 3 am for fog warning, for instance. Fog won't harm me when safe in bed in sturdy house unless I hurt myself being startled in my sleep by loud notification.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:17:51__

> No change. Even after clearing cache, rebooting phone, etc still getting multiples of same exact alerts and several alerts with little or no lead time. That's probably FEMA but still downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 22:38:27__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> What is it with this app. I've.been trying to download it for three days how long does it take to for it to download .we are about to be hit with a hurracain.this is messed.up<br> :date: __2020-08-23 03:40:24__

> This app did not help me.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 19:14:29__

> It really does do absolutely nothing. Not even sure why i have it<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:16:55__

> Alerts are way too excessive.. It's a little windy in my area and I get notifications what feel like every 5 minutes. Had to delete the app because it was so annoying.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 21:47:54__

> It's a weather alert app. I'm getting constant weather alerts during a pandemic lockdown<br> :date: __2020-03-29 17:05:00__
