## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Keeps you informed on natural disasters. Also offers other valuable information.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 00:41:48__

> Is there a way you could add an EWS system in this to where when there is a Flash flood warning or something of greater threat it gives a Dialog Alert and plays an alarm sound to alert you before it happens? I just think it would be pretty useful and cool.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 03:58:32__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-06-06 11:47:17__

> Is accurate<br> :date: __2021-06-04 22:03:27__

> What's with the 911 button? It's way too easy to accidentally hit that. Otherwise the setup seems pretty well designed.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 15:45:33__

> Good ad-free alerts app. Lets you specify the exact kinds of alerts you want for your area and others. It's only drawback is that its county-wide. Some alerts are issued for only specific areas of counties. This app would be perfect if would allow you to set alerts to a precise location (not just county-wide) as some other apps do. Also it needs other notification options (such as a voice or different sound) for alerts so they don't get lost with other notifications.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 21:27:43__

> I think that it's pretty good.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 04:02:31__

> This app is worth the download. You get a lot of notifications, but they are easy to mute, and might save your life.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 22:03:12__

> Really good weather alerts better than local tv<br> :date: __2021-01-26 10:34:47__

> So I love this app, but I feel as if you guys should check the reviews. There are people there with legitimate concerns, and some great recommendations that your should take look at. Such as: -Missing Alerts -A "Follow Me" option. -A priority alert mode (that fully covers your screen when you get a warning alert). I had a tornado warning in my area, and I love that I recieved it when using the app, but you should force the users to see a warning. These are the 3 options I'd love to see come.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 03:51:39__

> It has a lot of information anyone would ever need in this nation you could help you self and others in anything<br> :date: __2020-11-25 07:22:21__

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Great app !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 02:06:16__

> It works great but I finally deleted today after getting 20 of the same alert in less than 7 minutes it gets really annoy really fast<br> :date: __2021-06-12 23:08:07__

> Really need more precise location specification, not county-wide. I don't need daily heat advisories for the desert >50 miles away when it's 75F on the coast where I live!<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:55:26__

> Haven't had this installed for 24 hours yet however it was easy to install, set which alerts I want/need for the counties I need. I don't get weather alerts for whatever yhe reason (checked settings) and had to depend on others to relay alerts. I can now get the alerts myself and it may be a lifesaver since where I live we get severe weather, tornados and hurricanes regularly.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 22:42:49__

> It's helpful to have the alerts, but they come constantly about the same issue. They need to bundle alerts together and just say it's been updated.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:19:12__

> Works, but it keeps announcing the same alerts over and over, almost to the point of harassment! Also, the developer evidently does not read user comments, because they have not replied to any, a lot of which contain very good suggestions.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:07:44__

> Downloaded b/c we live in the country and cant hear sirens. Ive been getting notifications of weather advisories, but not able to read what, theres nothing there<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:56:35__

> Not much exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:03:49__

> Not as helpful as before<br> :date: __2020-12-28 07:32:52__

> They did not explain what she was asking me about and was real short with me . To me she was rude but I need my house fixed not TVs or other stuff like that but thank you for what you did do.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:49:29__

> Also I build homeless shelters and I think this would be the place to add my location make it official<br> :date: __2020-10-06 07:13:34__

> Was a great App, then started sending multiple alerts one after another. Now I get NO alerts at all. If I click on Alerts, click my city, it takes me to settings. I wrote you about it, you sent an email telling me to restart because you fixed a bug on the 4th. It is now the 14th. I've done as you said, even uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I still get no alerts and when I click my city, it still takes me to settings. I loved your App, it's a shame it no longer functions correctly.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 21:54:56__

> Super irregular performance and notifications. I cannot rely on this for requested information or results<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:22:01__

> Need more control over types of alerts. Don't need to be woken from deep sleep at 3 am for fog warning, for instance. Fog won't harm me when safe in bed in sturdy house unless I hurt myself being startled in my sleep by loud notification.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:17:51__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> What is it with this app. I've.been trying to download it for three days how long does it take to for it to download .we are about to be hit with a hurracain.this is messed.up<br> :date: __2020-08-23 03:40:24__

> Didn't go there that i remember, maybe passed through.<br> :date: __2021-06-20 15:54:51__

> And once again many false alerts - almost 40% - with warnings that provide no info at all or nothing updated in the alert information. That's probably FEMA but still seriously downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety. The app is almost completely unreliable because of so many false notifications, and we're just beginning another severe thunderstorm season. I still use it but I have not been able to trust it for a very long time. Sad.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:49:04__

> What?! Have you made this so difficult that I will become frustrated and stop? I swear, I have been, somehow poisoned.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 08:24:07__

> My name is DIANE KMIEC (not A Google User)!!! 3/27/21: I MUST UNINSTALL. I have received NO ALERTS or EMERGENCY data since the 1st days. Very alarmed that "FEMA" can't even get through to send me Emergency Alerts! \*\*\*\* I installed this. I hope it works as it should because my phone has been modified to stop me from receiving ANY Emergency alerts. (I believe that's illegal.) I am so desperate to receive Emergency Alerts that I'm downloading an outside app for it!<br> :date: __2021-03-27 23:50:09__

> this app as well as so many others show i downloaded them when i infact have not<br> :date: __2021-03-10 03:18:24__

> I am deleting this app. I get 6 or more notifications a day when we are getting 2-4 inches of snow. It wakes me in the middle of the night to update when I have already recieved the same notification before. It's too bad, I liked getting the bitter windchill warning. If the weather was serious it would be fine but I don't consider 4 inches of snow a blizzard.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 00:50:48__

> Why wasn't there an alert when the POTUS called the state of emergency for DC? He even mentioned FEMA for receiving info yet crickets feo FEMA. Z Typical government restrictions. If they block adding Washington D.C. as an area then they are blocking additional information. It will only have the activity they want you to know about. New rule for citizens. See something say nothing. You'll be safer that way.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 21:44:55__

> Stopped working a few days ago. Started sending empty alerts. Reinstallation didn't help. Wouldn't accept location input.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:46:26__

> Can't load location for alerts or risk mitigation<br> :date: __2021-01-03 18:53:48__

> Dumb app. Just go outside and read the weather instead.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 16:24:43__
