### Description
> This is the official app of New York State, run by the NYS Department of Health as part of New York State‚Äôs comprehensive COVID-19 testing and contact tracing effort. The ultimate goal is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by:
<br>1. Alerting you if a sick person spends 10 mins or more within 6 feet of you, because this puts you at a higher risk of SARS CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. 
<br>2. Encouraging you to contribute to the health and safety of your friends, family and community by alerting others if you test positive, WITHOUT REVEALING YOUR IDENTITY TO ANYONE!
<br>3. Getting you important resources and help if you are exposed or test positive. You can call the COVID Alert NY Hotline or find helpful links to resources on next steps to protect your loved ones.
<br>4. Keep a private log of your own symptoms which can help your health care provider and public health representatives determine next steps.
<br>The app leverages a completely private and secure Bluetooth-based technology that Apple and Google developed. The app‚Äôs source code is available to the public and has been vetted extensively by privacy and security experts. We never see your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New York.. Share this app with your friends and family so we can all be safer, together.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I understand privacy but for this app to truly work.... work related we make house calls but ask a series of questions before we enter the home. They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 22:08:36__

> Wish the data on the app was up to date vs 2 days behind.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 17:18:21__

> Could be more useful and informative. Details related to current current zone level and useful misc subjects should be added. User provided information to include self reporting of testing, type of testing, postive/false-positive/negative results, and self/state/organization/employer imposed quarantine. Application update/"whats new" information needs to be detailed, rather than a general out of date blanket statement describing the application.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 02:53:10__

> I installed this app 3 months ago and tested positive for the novel coronavirus 1 month ago. I was excited to warn nearby contacts of my status from the app, but doing so requires a secret 6-digit code and the contact tracer who was assigned to my case did not know what it was. I was so disappointed. My phone had collected 2 months of data about nearby contacts, but this information could not be used to save lives. I don't blame the contact tracer, but I hope this issue can be addressed.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:19:31__

> Assume this app works, but haven't had any alerts. Also the symptoms are similar to common cold and allergies so that may cause alarm to people.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 16:15:08__

> It's not detecting my Bluetooth.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 20:43:55__

> Wish this had an "I tested negative" button for people with symptoms that turn out to be unrelated. Also, I suspect this gives a false sense of security--the main threat is people who don't take this seriously. Those people aren't using this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 06:37:55__

> Tells you that you may have covid if you report one symptom. Useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 05:28:25__

> Not sure it works<br> :date: __2020-11-01 14:37:14__

> Good probably, but SILLY. it asks how you're feeling, and when I checked the box for a runny nose it gave me a "sorry you're not feeling well" page, complete with "could be COVID19" warnings. Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 00:45:24__

> The app is good but the contract tracers aren't using it.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 18:06:29__

> Two stars because: It is a shame that only just over 100k people have downloaded this app in a city of 8.4 million and a state of 12 million. Given zero privacy issues detected or reported, this app should be suggested via text messages all the time. This is a public health problem everyone should help in all possible ways.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 18:32:18__

> Does not give accurate numbers if total infected in some counties. Numbers are often misleading.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 22:56:07__

> More work on the app is needed. Despite enabling Bluetooth, the app still ask for you to do so; then it hangs. Keep work on it.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 13:41:49__

> concept is good. alas even with bluetooth on it didn't work. then again most of the people in my neighborhood refuse to get tested (I get tested) and/or aren't tech savvy so this app isn't useful for my neighborhood<br> :date: __2020-11-07 14:18:38__

> I loved this app, until yesterday when it stopped updating. The person info I have is now for 2 days ago. It's now worthless.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 12:29:55__

> This app in no way lets u know if you have been in contact with covid<br> :date: __2020-10-30 18:24:06__

> IMO, this is something which should be done on a national platform, and incorporated into Google, so all smartphone users have this information. Instead, this app is quite large, not moveable to the SD card, and forces you to use Bluetooth more often than is wise... not only for battery life, but vulnerability issues. Also, the "questionnaire" of daily symptoms blows quite the dog whistle, flipping out over a stuffy nose, practically equating it with a positive COVID diagnosis. Too many bugs to be worked out for my liking... sorry. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:43:45__

> I like the idea of an app like this a lot. It's not that I go out in public often, and being notified of a possible exposure is good. However, on my Pixel 3XL, performance went into the toilet, and the battery drain was insane. Normally, I could listen to YouTube music while working out in my basement and only go down to 85-90% from a full charge. With this installed, it drops to 25-30% in an hour. It also caused recharge times to increase dramatically. Fix that issue, and I will reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 13:24:54__

> I would like to keep this app installed but I think it was causing my phone a lot of issues. My phone kept forgetting bluetooth devices until I uninstalled this.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 14:37:11__

> Trash, pointless, fear-mongering nonsense. Put your money towards helping all of the small businesses you are killing instead of monitoring your residents.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 14:54:50__

> I'm curious on how anyone could defend this app when it violate HIPAA laws. If you go into a doctor's office and the secretary shows you her screen with someone else's name on the computer that's actually a violation of HIPAA laws so how is this not face it this app is illegal and should be removed as soon as possible or should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law<br> :date: __2020-12-12 16:04:00__

> Does not give updated information that is needed of positive cases in the area. Requires a code to be given out when you become a positive case. Not very descriptive and helpful into preventing the covid-19 issue . It also disrupts the use of other apps. For example messenger, facebook, and the use of your own wi-fi. While this app is running, shows on messenger for example that has to wait for the network to connect before it will work. Not a very good app needs more updates.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 12:04:54__

> So you expect me to believe that people who test positive for the plague, are actually going to be honest & record their data, then go out against the rules and let you track them? Do you delete the info after 2 weeks or keep warning people 3 months later? If it doesn't alert someone immediately, then all you're doing is feeding fear into peoples' minds by sending the "warning" later. What's the point in this? So everyone here is staying home any time a warning pops up? If not, why have this?<br> :date: __2020-12-08 10:53:14__

> Doesn't work. It never says if I'm near anyone.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 06:41:24__

> Was around someone who tested positive and was in a cluster area and get no alert. This app does not work. You all must be collection other information from my phone but it sure was not covid19 information<br> :date: __2020-12-05 11:36:27__

> Is bod<br> :date: __2020-12-05 06:13:11__

> Its asking me to turn on bt which is already turned on.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 13:51:59__

> It keeps running in the background and running the battery life down on my phone Not cool at all , I realize Covid-19 is serious and it's good to know if someone is exposed but why run the app all the time in the background it serves no purpose other than killing the battery life of my phone .<br> :date: __2020-12-03 14:50:38__

> App was automatically installed on my device one day... Not cool.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 01:53:54__
