## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My daughter and I took the test the same time and I haven't got hers<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:51:38__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-18 00:22:52__

> The app was helpful but would not allow me to change the date of birth to see other results attached to my phone number.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 18:02:03__

> I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:46:54__

> I had to attempt it twice before i was successful. I think i was in a hurry and stressed to get the results.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:25:58__

> Useless impossible to navigate<br> :date: __2020-12-06 13:49:19__

> Everything went smoothly. Results were back in a timely manner. The app was easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 13:51:03__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:16:06__

> Good app, easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 17:40:38__

> I had my test done last Friday. Sat Igot a text that my results where on this app. Unable to start at all. Sunday and today Monday unable to access the info. Call the # 0n one of my emails and the automated system says WE WONT GIVE YOU THE RESULTS . What is the point of even downloading this stupid app. Plz make it simple and easy.. very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:23:43__
