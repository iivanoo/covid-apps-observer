## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProMedica Health System, Inc. |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | digital.communications@promedica.org |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> You can combine several hospitals together if they use Epic. Haven't figured out the best way to combine dissimilar systems into Mychart. Also trying to figure out the best app to use to import data like pulse, heart rate, pain levels, and exercising habits.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 00:34:41__

> You have to enter in a bunch of information before being seen, but by the time you get to the end, the doctor is no longer available. The interface is great, but I can't actually get to a doctor.

> Pitiful.. screw you<br> :date: __2020-05-25 23:40:11__

> according to my insurance this should be free but they tried to bill me 59 dollars what the heck<br> :date: __2019-08-08 15:30:32__

> This service is very misleading as I consulted the website prior to paying $59 to be told that this service would not be able to help. The attached shows exactly how you advertise this service. I was unable to leave home or visit a doctors office for the condition my child needed treatment for which was advertised on the website. That was an easy $59 for the doctor and useless/expensive for me. I Would never recommend this service to anyway. False Advertising!!<br> :date: __2019-02-18 23:07:09__

> Wanted an app for MyChart, and this is what it takes me to. There is no app for MyChart. You'd think as big as the organization is they'd come up with an app that does what the CUSTOMER wants.<br> :date: __2017-10-30 18:33:07__
