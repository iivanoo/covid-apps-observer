<br>Think of our eClinic as a high-tech house call, giving you access to an Iowa Clinic provider when you can’t make a trip to the doctor’s office or urgent care. When you visit The Iowa eClinic, you can see a healthcare professional from the comfort of your own home or office. Through the convenience of video, we provide online consultations to answer medical questions, diagnose illnesses, and evaluate injuries.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I appreciate that the app is not difficult to follow and understand if you take your time. I love that it is devoted strictly to e-visits, rather than making them part of the patient portal. When you get logged in, there's no hunting through menus, you are taken immediately to the list of providers and can easily differentiate between those who are available and those who are not. It is incredibly user friendly, at least to this user. Thank you!<br> :date: __2021-03-19 21:40:02__
