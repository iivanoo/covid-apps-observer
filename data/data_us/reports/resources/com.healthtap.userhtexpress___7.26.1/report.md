### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>Monthly membership (when you’re not using insurance). $45 for the first visit, then after you will have access to 24/7 virtual doctor visits for just $10 per month.
<br>Pay-per-visit (when you’re using insurance). Costs vary based on insurance copay and deductible. Many plans cover 100%!
<br>Unlike other on-demand providers, HealthTap connects you with a doctor via text or video in less than one minute--not hours or even the next day. We also don’t require you to answer a bunch of questions in advance. You can see a doctor immediately.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>Note that certain medications including controlled substances must be prescribed by a specialist or with an in-person visit, and cannot be ordered by HealthTap doctors or any other on-demand provider.
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>1. ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>2. SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>3. ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is a great service with great providers. one downside though is that I couldn't get an answer from my Doctor due to the app being buggy.<br> :date: __2019-04-20 03:40:59__

> Symptom checker need further enhancement<br> :date: __2018-10-14 16:27:26__

> Full of bugs in new version, I can't open my notifications, I can't see my questions. Another thing is that you ask a simple yes or no question but the doctors answer something else.<br> :date: __2018-09-07 23:00:52__

> As much as I like this service since it keeps me from needing to go to a 
doctor's office, it needs work. I have done two consults now as a Prime 
member. My prescriptions were not actually called in on either one, 
resulting in extra time and visits needed at my pharmacies.<br> :date: __2018-08-03 15:34:35__

> I used once without an issue. Now I've paid for another consult but had no 
response from the physician and I keep getting a pop up about verifying my 
email but the link is never sent (I've checked all folders). So now I'm 
just out $50??<br> :date: __2018-07-29 04:51:44__

> I don't care for the app too much<br> :date: __2018-02-25 19:30:18__

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:05:40__

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable. Just be aware that the free service could have you waiting quite a while for any responses. You might be better off with other services.<br> :date: __2019-10-03 13:28:51__

> stomach pain<br> :date: __2019-01-17 00:45:53__

> Was using the service for over a year and consulting with Dr Leslie Hart. 
They changed the service now I cant find her, get my meds anymore and have 
been going through hell. Thanks HealthTap for changing services on people 
who now can't get their meds.<br> :date: __2018-08-10 19:23:24__

> I'm not going to be paying for this after my trial ends, as it shuts down every time a consult begins. Doesn't let me do a thing. I already paid 19.99 and I'm asking for a refund.<br> :date: __2018-01-06 19:21:22__

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

> Wouldn't let me add or update. I kept trying but it would not work.  Plus it kept asking me to upgrade to add money.<br> :date: __2016-03-23 15:29:33__

> I've asked questions twice now without an answer. I guess now you have to pay if you want your question answered. As recent as last fall I had my questions answered within 24 hours. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2016-03-12 21:59:11__

> It keeps saying cannot play video cant use the app. It always says cannot play video -.-<br> :date: __2016-02-11 14:06:09__

> Tricked me out of $50. Don't use this. Thought I could get my standard medications from here. Nope. Was told they can't send anxiety medications. "Dr" instructed me that I had to be seen by my pcp. Kept my composure, thanked the "Dr" and canceled my account. Now I'm out of $50. Dont make the mistake I made. I'm going to go back to trying to get KHealth to work....<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:32:28__

> Can't easily put in date of birth<br> :date: __2020-11-27 05:07:52__

> Forces you to pay $45 set up fee or $65 per month for a Basic Membership. No longer affordable.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:59:37__

> No help<br> :date: __2020-11-18 04:21:34__

> NEVER WORKS! They've now got my money and I've got no help!<br> :date: __2020-10-31 20:42:45__

> been 3 days and no one reply to my question yet<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:22:29__

> Its false advertising ! All I asked for was a note to get a memory foam mattress topper in a sober living home, just a note he couldn't even do that. Ser vice is a rip off for real..<br> :date: __2020-09-27 07:50:53__

> Horrible registration process. It asks for location. I allow the location and it detects im not in US but registration requires my address and the phone which will be used for collecting the prescription and select the pharmacy in US when obviously i will not be able to go there! And you cant register without doing these steps! And in their website says for non US residents you can still use to get the diagnostic etc. Meh, another useless app in the store<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:42:28__

> The app rules is unclear, it's so disappointing<br> :date: __2020-09-20 00:04:59__

> UNEXCUSABLE. Go to purchase $10 subscription for Virtual Dr and upon entering all my payment Info, it tells me the payment didn't work so I went back and did it again. Same outcome. I went to PayPal to check the history be and turns out I was charged $1 authorization charge BOTH times. No refund, no Customer service help, NOTHING. Sends NOT one payment verification info but would have kept charging $1 each time trying to update payment. HEALTH TAP SHOULD BE ASHAMED<br> :date: __2020-08-24 12:53:33__
