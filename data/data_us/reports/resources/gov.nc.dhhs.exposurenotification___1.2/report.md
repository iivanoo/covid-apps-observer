### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Relaxing, enjoyable, and fun !!!<br> :date: __2020-12-11 21:11:09__

> Now, if only NC citizens would simply be honest about their exposing others to their positive Covid test as soon as notified. Instead, so many are carelessly waiting until they get negative result. Meanwhile the positives are spreading Covid in neighborhoods, stores, churches, and other public places... WITH NO MASKS! Just because you didn't need ICU, doesn't mean others you exposed will be as fortunate. Get Behind THE Mask! 🙏😷🙏<br> :date: __2020-12-07 04:22:22__

> Great idea!<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:06:31__

> Has stopped checking for exposure. Last checked for exposure 11/20 on my pixel 3. I cleared app data and it checked in today.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 11:17:59__

> JBE<br> :date: __2020-11-25 03:46:16__

> So I got the notification to install the app and I live in Ohio.. Does it still work? It's not geo locked is it?<br> :date: __2020-11-07 01:12:30__

> This app is a great concept; unfortunately with my Motorola G7 Power, I can't leave my Bluetooth on all the time, as due to a manufacturer error in this model, having bluetooth activated interferes with WiFi connections. So I can't utilize this app, but certainly will when I replace my phone.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 22:12:17__

> I check every so often & I last checked it this evening (12/13 ~8:20pm) & it says it last checked exposures at 6:33pm, so that's fine. But what I'm worried about is if other people are actually using the app. I try to stay home as much as possible, but I have gone out recently and I'm concerned that the app hasn't picked up on exposures. Not that I want to be exposed, but it sure would be nice to know if I had, esp given the rate that covid is rising in the state...Samsung galaxy S10 user.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 02:29:38__

> If there were only a way to make cell carriers (companies) make this mandatory. I mean, right now it just feels like everyone who is trying to be compliant and healthy is just walking around bouncing off cell phone vibes off each other. The rest of these idiots aren't using this app anyway. Apparently, over the last two weeks I have been close to three separate people who claim to be positive. I wasn't near them unmasked or for a prolonged period, and 6 ft. apart. But how do we know?<br> :date: __2020-12-13 15:58:46__

> 😳<br> :date: __2020-12-12 20:11:11__

> Stupid sinnesxt Ureu r 543or.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 17:48:35__

> Success depends on how many people use the app, which not many appear to do. In a pandemic, it should be mandatory for everyone with a cellphone to be connected. Otherwise, it's pointless.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 15:56:28__

> Happy to have this app. It was working fine for about a week. I could see that it was checking for exposures multiple times per day. Since 11/20, however, it has not checked for exposures. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still not reporting that it is checking for exposures. All settings seem correct. I have a google pixel 4a.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 01:23:45__

> App hasn't updated in four days. I was updating daily prior to 11/20???<br> :date: __2020-11-24 22:58:16__

> The app is a great concept and was checking when initially installed. On my Samsung S6, it was a power drain. Also, it hasn't checked for exposures since 10/23/20. Today is 11/20/20 so its been almost a month. As COVID case rates are accelerating again, it seems this app would be more pertinent than ever. I'm looking forward to any suggestions that may be offered to resolve these two issues.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 10:47:56__

> Stopped updating 3 weeks ago. I checked the settings. It said all was good but app would not update. Prior to last update it did so at least once a day. So I wonder how accurate it is???<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:30:16__

> I downloaded this app when it first came out. It checked often for exposure. Today, October 26, it says that the last time it checked was October 13. Almost 2 weeks ago! What's up??? Bluetooth is enabled.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:09:52__

> Just got app I'll let you know later!<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:56:23__

> I tried contacting them, and my test was not showing up in their system so they could not give me a PIN. I used the link your provided and I also called when the link was telling me I wasn't in the system.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 14:54:23__

> A small percentage of people are downloading this for Android (can't speak for iOS), and such a small percentage of people are actually tested daily in this state. It's more like a gimmick app unless everyone downloads and everyone gets weekly testing. So no way to know if this approach to contact tracing is working.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 14:45:11__

> I installed this app at the beginning of November, and that was the only time it checked for exposures. What use is that? I could not find a way to manually check either.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 04:56:58__

> Exposure last checked: October 31, 2020 8:15am. It's November 23 now. I thought this app was a great idea. But now I have some random app that is connected to my Bluetooth 24/7 and I'm deleting it.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:41:06__

> Installed it. Had 100% battery life, 6 hrs later it is down to 39%. I did this overnight so it is when nothing else is on or working. I have other apps restricted so they cannot be an energy vampire. I have uninstalled the app. Samsung S10<br> :date: __2020-11-11 14:23:49__

> App is completely based on a user uploading their data to contact others. I'm in a county where people can't spell app, let alone upload any data to help others. This app needs to have the state, county or testing facilitators uploading this information so someone who does have COVID cannot chose to NOT share those who were around them.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 17:10:45__

> While the app is easy to use and read, the app prevents use of bluetooth keyboards and controllers for more than a few minutes. After that, this app forcibly disconnects your accessories, and you need to manually reconnect.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 02:26:22__

> If it weren't so disturbing that something like this is just being touted by DHHS to slow Covid, I'd be jumping for joy. But, now,, all i can muster is too little too late for 100s of 1000s.Apple cranks out a new iPhone with world-wide ads faster than this. I'd say I can't believe it but, this is a red state and the "Red Pres" is pulling out all stops to pull a victory out of his red, you know what, like he did last time. Meadows did say they weren't going to try to control the virus. Shameful!<br> :date: __2020-11-02 12:23:28__

> After installing this app, 2 of my other apps disappeared from my phone. Also another day my flashlight randomly turned on and I want even touching my phone. I've uninstalled the app since.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 18:01:57__

> resourse hog.. I've tried this app on at least 3 diff phones and i now have one of the best phones out there Samsung S20 Ultra 5G and it even bogs this phone down too. I noticed this problem specifically when trying to screen cast to my TV, which is something I do often when playing my drums to music. shut this app off.. problem solved..<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:15:48__

> Second review, again, about not being able to obtain a PIN. I've tried every way possible to get one and am unable. Was told may take 24 hours since notification of positive result, it has now been 72 hours, a phone call from the health department, and being symptom free for 24 hours since notification and I am still unable to obtain a PIN because "I'm not in the system." Deleting this app and relying on social media is probably better for notification of exposure. Stay healthy!<br> :date: __2020-12-16 15:50:45__

> The app isn't actually checking for exposure. Opened it today and it was last checked for exposure three weeks ago.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 18:39:14__

> The app nonfactions are anoying everytime I turn off the location and bluetooth a anoying nonfactions come in a minute .<br> :date: __2020-12-15 17:27:37__

> Never was notified<br> :date: __2020-12-11 00:26:46__

> One star for the idea. All other stars gone because it doesn't work. Last checked for exposure 11/25/20. I set it up to never be put to sleep, but it just doesn't check and there's no way to force it to update.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 20:08:11__

> Idk<br> :date: __2020-12-08 12:08:56__

> Great idea but it stopped working Nov. 20th. When will it start working again?<br> :date: __2020-12-06 19:02:47__

> When I first downloaded i had a app that protect me from hackers and it said that 4 ppl was trying to hack me with 317 trackers<br> :date: __2020-12-06 10:16:43__

> I have had this app sense it came out and not once have I seen any information or gotten a notification. Undoubtedly no one uses this app because I work where there have been at least 20 some cases it looks as if one person would have this app, but no. Its useless<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:49:51__
