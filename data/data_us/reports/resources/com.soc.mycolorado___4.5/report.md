## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love the app however it's kind of a pain to get a verification every time you need to use it<br> :date: __2021-05-17 21:47:54__

> Its helpful I just wish more ppl accepted it.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 14:37:19__

> I saw other comments about the digital ID not recognizing them the same day they went to the DMV. I gave it a try after I went in yesterday and got the same error message as everyone else. I gave it another try today and it worked! Looks like it takes a bit of time for their system to update, which is understandable. A government app that kinda works... what a nice surprise! 4 stars!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:33:45__

> Used to keep me logged in. Know I have to log in every time and the app has to ping my phone evert time 🤔🥴<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:26:24__

> In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:42:03__

> 2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. 👍When this app is working, its amazing.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 05:22:11__

> When it wants to verify me by taking a picture the oval frame is black and wont take a picture. The app is useless to me if i cant use it for its intended purpose.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 16:14:20__

> Have had 2021 fishing lic for 3 weeks and it's still not available on myColo????<br> :date: __2021-04-23 01:26:14__

> I'm sure it's a great site, but it does not let me create a site with my California DL.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 22:12:39__

> Damn camera will not scan the barcode on back of i.d. really frustrating if only I could use this it would save me alot of stress and help me alot at the moment<br> :date: __2021-04-15 12:07:20__

> It keeps showing error all the time I try to upload my insurance cards<br> :date: __2021-04-09 15:41:45__

> In my house and put that in your house In<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:02:00__

> To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 01:43:26__

> Terrible third-party software for text verification and face ID.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 02:33:43__

> The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:30:27__

> MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 03:49:21__
