## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It is ok.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 20:42:53__

> Extremely hard to get help with prescription medication if local pharmacy cannot obtain the drug. Customer service support number is 'no longer in service' when called.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 13:34:21__

> Answering the same questions week after week is annoying. Covid questions for Virtual Visits?? Seriously??!! People have a .02% of catching it and an even lesser % of it being deadly. Do you really think it's gonna transfer thru a phone? js<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:00:55__

> The program freezes up and constantly has to be restarted<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:56:32__

> The concept is awesome, but it would be beneficial to have interaction with the "patient portal" that seton ascension clinics use. Or even to see services and billing history that you can interact with within the app itself.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 20:19:52__

> Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment<br> :date: __2021-01-21 19:47:37__

> Requires wifi which is not always readily available. Does not work well on cellular network<br> :date: __2021-01-19 23:19:24__

> Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it<br> :date: __2020-10-27 20:39:40__

> There are usually technical glitches - audio, video, failure to connect.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 16:25:13__

> I live in Evansville, Indiana. Which app and portal do I need to use for St Vincents outpatient login<br> :date: __2020-08-04 20:35:13__

> The app has a tendency to drop the connection and can take a while to reconnect. This dropping and reconnecting takes time away feom the patient and provider and is very inconvenient. It also tends to not reconnect the video or freezes up. I don't know how new the app it but it has some bugs that need to be worked out. I have not had a session yet were the app has not dropped everything.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 18:53:45__

> Update 6/19/20: The developer reached out and we just had an online 1:1 feedback/user experience interview. I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:33:43__

> Visit froze 3 times. Kind of irritating.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:44:17__

> All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???<br> :date: __2020-12-23 18:37:38__

> App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the "sent" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 15:34:50__

> Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:42:09__

> App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 15:27:27__

> Keeps freezing an breaking up.hard to hear...<br> :date: __2020-06-02 19:48:36__

> Video Quality is not good at all. There's a huge lag and pixeling issues.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 18:53:55__

> Poor video quality & sound. Distorted video while in use and sound cutting in and out.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 22:22:25__

> I trying to get payment set up, but it won't accept my card. Yes, I've make sure everything is entered correctly.<br> :date: __2020-04-03 18:46:55__

> Cant get pass entering my password useless!!<br> :date: __2021-04-24 00:47:06__

> Horrible<br> :date: __2021-04-10 01:40:45__

> Don't use this app unless your covered by their specific insurance plan. Took 3 days to get the meds they prescribed to my pharmacy. That was with over 48 hours trying to get them to even fix the issue of even knowing I was seen the day before. Also if you are on medicaid, they don't support you so all meds won't be covered at all cause their doctors aren't covered by medicaid. Once all this had gone down, it shows $59 dollars for nothing and was even double charged wrongfully on my credit card.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 21:04:46__

> Cannot access login on the previously installed app. Denies login, as well as creating a new account. Flags that I am not using an existing email after entering the first digit of me email address.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 12:35:23__

> App looks nice, but crashes everytime I try to add a credit card, making it completely useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 00:14:56__

> Couldn't even find primary care physician on it and you can't book an appointment if you don't have insurance.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 06:29:38__

> aweful. theres 4 buttons and none do anything<br> :date: __2021-02-27 21:17:28__
