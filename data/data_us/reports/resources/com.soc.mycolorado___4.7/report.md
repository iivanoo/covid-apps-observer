## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My only problem is why I have it is a lot of places don't consider it valid you know you can't use it to get your ID a lot of motels won't take it I couldn't even get little fireworks from King Soopers with it that's why I only complain about it and it's a legit Colorado government ID so I understand everything is going digital<br> :date: __2021-06-23 11:00:06__

> When it works, it works. When it doesn't work, well, good luck.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 16:32:03__

> This app worked fine until april/may 2021. Now the app just crashes. The app is a good idea and nice especially if on a bike so you dont need to carry as much, problem is the app does not and will not stay open. It crashes constantly and some features will not open at all and when tried, it causes the app to crash as well. I wish the powers at be could get this app to actually work. Ride safe, Kg<br> :date: __2021-06-17 23:40:36__

> It won't let me access it or send me verification code, but thank you for at least responding to my issues here! I just thought it was never going to be addressed, I appreciate that!<br> :date: __2021-06-12 01:05:14__

> Every time I attempt to get my insurance cards, the application crashes.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 04:06:00__

> This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with "certificate errors" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 06:47:57__

> App keeps crashing when opening insurance section.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:00:54__

> Not for use in any situation where speed or proof of insurance is necessary. Alot of layers of security just to open the app, then I'd get kicked completely out of the app when I tried to open the proof of insurance. Then of course all the security again. I ended up using the paper documents anyway. And didn't we fight a war or something to avoid apps like this anyway?<br> :date: __2021-06-19 04:59:48__

> Unable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification code every time I'm trying to log in which is sent to my old phone number which I don't have access to because it's my old phone number so I don't know how I'm going to access my information because I can't access the account with my old number so this is kind of dumbUnable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification<br> :date: __2021-06-16 00:19:38__

> Not great experience. Cannot seem to link digital fishing license to app. Very sluggish app.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 00:02:32__

> Doesn't work. Scans and then says I need a license which it scanned.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 15:44:47__

> Seems like every update you have to re-register. Could be a decent, it's just not reliable. Maybe you could try to architect it so that you reuse the user data after each update??<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:31:46__

> Nine out of 10 times I'm unable to log in. On the few times I've been able to get to the authentication page afterwards I get an error message. I thought this app would be a game changer having everything in one place but I can't even get it to open<br> :date: __2021-06-10 22:22:06__

> Works for drivers license. Fishing and hunting licenses dont show up.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 00:42:26__

> Just don't bother. Unfortunately no one reads reviews before installing an app. But this one is beyond useless. Installed it quite a while ago and created an account. Now it won't let me log in using my credentials stored with Google. And no email is ever sent to reset the password. This is the usual outcome when government agencies award the project to the lowest foreign bidder. I own a software development company and we are constantly fixing their problems. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-06-26 19:20:16__

> Not good<br> :date: __2021-06-24 09:52:28__

> Waste of time and data<br> :date: __2021-06-24 00:19:09__

> App won't update or open.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 01:36:40__

> Cool at first now it keeps saying there is an update even after downloading it it just keeps going back and forth from update screen to the app and occasionally it will lete click on the sighm in button but say all certificates need check or remewed<br> :date: __2021-06-23 01:27:40__

> Won't even open!! ... tells me it has an update and sends me to the store....there's no update....typical bureaucratic incompetence...<br> :date: __2021-06-22 23:23:23__

> Unable to log in now, says there is an update but when Ì try to update it says it's up to date.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 22:15:20__

> Update as of June 2021: App is unusable, keeps telling me to update, brings me to the app store, then no update available. Shame because now I can't use the digital fishing license... Old 5 star review: This app is great, no idea what the others are saying. Easy to add vaccine card, insurance cards, fishing licenses. I can't wait until this gets more adoption across the state (and nation).<br> :date: __2021-06-22 20:24:49__

> My app was working just fine and I was using it constantly then about a month ago it stopped working. When I would log in it would go back and forth to the pingid and login screen. It will not properly work. I also sent an email about it and never received a response back. This app needs to work properly! Edit to add even after the new update it still doesn't work. Just does the same login then ping I'd then login again. Very disappointed as I would use this often.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 19:53:43__

> App is tripin<br> :date: __2021-06-22 19:52:01__
