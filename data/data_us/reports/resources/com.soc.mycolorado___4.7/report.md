## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When it works, it works. When it doesn't work, well, good luck.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 16:32:03__

> This app worked fine until april/may 2021. Now the app just crashes. The app is a good idea and nice especially if on a bike so you dont need to carry as much, problem is the app does not and will not stay open. It crashes constantly and some features will not open at all and when tried, it causes the app to crash as well. I wish the powers at be could get this app to actually work. Ride safe, Kg<br> :date: __2021-06-17 23:40:36__

> Doesn't show any current hunting/fishing licenses or Parks passes regardless of if they were purchased one day ago or 6 months ago<br> :date: __2021-06-28 04:54:39__

> Every time I attempt to get my insurance cards, the application crashes.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 04:06:00__

> This app worked perfectly for a while, but now I'm met with "certificate errors" and am unable to view my ID or even get to the login page.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 06:47:57__

> App keeps crashing when opening insurance section.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:00:54__

> Not for use in any situation where speed or proof of insurance is necessary. Alot of layers of security just to open the app, then I'd get kicked completely out of the app when I tried to open the proof of insurance. Then of course all the security again. I ended up using the paper documents anyway. And didn't we fight a war or something to avoid apps like this anyway?<br> :date: __2021-06-19 04:59:48__

> Unable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification code every time I'm trying to log in which is sent to my old phone number which I don't have access to because it's my old phone number so I don't know how I'm going to access my information because I can't access the account with my old number so this is kind of dumbUnable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification<br> :date: __2021-06-16 00:19:38__

> Not great experience. Cannot seem to link digital fishing license to app. Very sluggish app.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 00:02:32__

> Doesn't work. Scans and then says I need a license which it scanned.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 15:44:47__

> Seems like every update you have to re-register. Could be a decent, it's just not reliable. Maybe you could try to architect it so that you reuse the user data after each update??<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:31:46__

> Nine out of 10 times I'm unable to log in. On the few times I've been able to get to the authentication page afterwards I get an error message. I thought this app would be a game changer having everything in one place but I can't even get it to open<br> :date: __2021-06-10 22:22:06__

> Camera doesn't work for face match. LG v50. The oval is totally blacked out.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 01:37:47__

> Doesn't even work every action inside app requires an account and everything i make an account it just resets. Update created an account now it won't do anything cause YOU'RE app can't verify my id with my face. What a waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 16:33:38__

> Won't show my info without selfie, but won't access camera to take selfie. Just black.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 06:51:21__

> I cannot use facial recognition to verify my digital ID on Android. I'm not sure why this isn't working but this needs to be fixed<br> :date: __2021-07-02 01:33:58__

> Does not take your photo no matter what you do<br> :date: __2021-07-01 16:47:12__

> Don't bother with this app. Facemapping does NOT WORK (and it isn't for your security, anyway: it's for facial-recognition databasing) - regardless whether you're on a T3 connection, have a top-tier phone and are standing in broad daylight. Less hassle and faster to actually go in person to whatever governmental office you're trying to get service from. Unusable and worthless.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 05:26:39__

> Doesn't work, used to work fine. Now I can't log in nor will it send the text code to my phone to log in.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 01:12:48__

> Just don't bother. Unfortunately no one reads reviews before installing an app. But this one is beyond useless. Installed it quite a while ago and created an account. Now it won't let me log in using my credentials stored with Google. And no email is ever sent to reset the password. This is the usual outcome when government agencies award the project to the lowest foreign bidder. I own a software development company and we are constantly fixing their problems. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-06-26 19:20:16__

> Not good<br> :date: __2021-06-24 09:52:28__
