## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

The app is a good idea and nice especially if on a bike so you dont need to carry as much, problem is the app does not and will not stay open. It crashes constantly and some features will not open at all and when tried, it causes the app to crash as well. I wish the powers at be could get this app to actually work.

> Waste of time. I've referred so many people to this app too. Then like a month ago useless. I can't open the insurance at all the app just closes. Stupid really. Why bother if I can't store everything in one place. UGH<br> :date: __2021-07-07 14:14:29__

Alot of layers of security just to open the app, then I'd get kicked completely out of the app when I tried to open the proof of insurance. Then of course all the security again. I ended up using the paper documents anyway. And didn't we fight a war or something to avoid apps like this anyway?<br> :date: __2021-06-19 04:59:48__

> Unable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification code every time I'm trying to log in which is sent to my old phone number which I don't have access to because it's my old phone number so I don't know how I'm going to access my information because I can't access the account with my old number so this is kind of dumbUnable to change my phone number from my old number to my new number in the app because it asked for a verification<br> :date: __2021-06-16 00:19:38__

> After initial install app wants to verify identity before first use. I've tried on and off of wifi. It acts like something is loading for a few seconds and then ultimately nothing happens 🤷‍♂️ I like the idea, but it doesn't seem to be working.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 17:50:47__

> Invasive and requires unnecessary permissions. Makes you scan your face for facial recognition database. Avoid it!<br> :date: __2021-07-08 21:53:01__
