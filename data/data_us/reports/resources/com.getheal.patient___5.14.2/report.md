## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app. Nice clean UI. Does what it needs to do without getting in the way with too many bells and whistles.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 05:44:02__

> We have used the HEAL app since 2019 when my daughter was in bed for 3 days and couldn't move due to a headache. Dr. Mitton came out within hours to see her and properly diagnosed her with migraines (which run in my family). The process was amazing. She couldn't have walked out of the house to the car to get to our Dr so it was a blessing to have the Dr come to us. We have used the app a few times and will continue to do so in the future!<br> :date: __2021-03-12 15:33:44__

> Wonderful conversation with the Dr. She was very sweet and Her Concern was outstanding!<br> :date: __2021-03-03 05:54:10__

> I would have to come back and read this app later. All I could say is that the nurse assistant that came to see me was a very proficient, professional, and personable, young lady with a very wonderful attitude.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 02:39:28__

> I had a very good virtual visit with Dr. Lingad who reviewed my health-care issue today, March 29th. Thanks for assigning him to me.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 23:04:30__

> Better with Dr Mc Duffie.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 15:32:57__

> Great service, app can be a bit annoying, but it's full of useful information<br> :date: __2020-07-20 22:40:40__

> Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.<br> :date: __2018-10-01 01:48:41__

> Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5<br> :date: __2018-09-28 06:26:18__

> The app works great for scheduling and getting regular updates, but I wish 
I could access the care plans from within the app, rather than needing to 
go to the website; it makes me question why I should use the app over the 
website.<br> :date: __2018-05-04 18:36:50__

> Thought I would give it a try and was pleased. Showed up early in their window. Noted they claim they work with Cogna but not sure. For me the convenience was well worth the extra price over sitting in some ready center. Will use this service again.<br> :date: __2018-03-06 22:59:40__

> Great app, I needed the flu shot asap the doc showed up gave me the shot all done with in 10 minutes. I will definitely be using the heal app again.<br> :date: __2018-02-19 18:00:59__

> Ive heard about this app on Dr. Drews show. I belive this app has alot of potential but its not available in moreno valley. When can we expect more areas???<br> :date: __2016-05-23 20:04:57__

> I enjoy talking with the doctor<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:47:50__

> There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:49:22__

> Waiting patiently for HEAL to come to my area in Florida!<br> :date: __2019-10-29 03:29:26__

> My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2018-12-04 20:06:26__

> When entering birthday, a required field, the only method is using the pop up calendar which defaults to today's date and only let's you go back one month at a time, so if you are 30 years old, you need to tap the back arrow at least 360 times to get to your birthday, really? Why not allow someone to just type it in?? No healthy person would want to do this let alone a sick person. Terrible UI design.<br> :date: __2017-11-25 07:58:07__

> There is no services in the Las Vegas,  NV valley @ all.  We need the doctor sevices here.  We have to wait 2 to 3 months to get in for appointments.  It is a shame or waiting in line @ Urgent care for 2 or 3 hours..<br> :date: __2016-11-01 21:15:32__

> Wish it was available in my area.<br> :date: __2015-11-22 22:40:57__

> Do they take any insurance at all??<br> :date: __2015-08-17 01:35:28__

> There are multiple issues with this app. 1. There needs to be a visual timestamp. Especially in chat. It's obvious as to why it's not there, but it would and should be displayed ethically. 2. There should be a way to set an audible notification, as I have no idea until I look again, whether or not my chat has been answered.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:36:42__

> This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...<br> :date: __2019-08-20 22:15:47__

> The app has not allowed me to select a date for appointments for two months. It freezes and I have to close the app entirely, then call anyway to make my appointments. The frustration compounds when appointments are cancelled and I have to repeat the process.<br> :date: __2019-07-18 03:08:25__

> Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the "schedule a service" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?<br> :date: __2018-12-05 18:14:31__

> The service is terrific but the app is no longer working well. I have to use the website rather than the app to schedule my appointments.<br> :date: __2018-09-23 18:26:18__

> Live in Walnut Creek. One side of the street has service, other side doesn't. Mind blown!<br> :date: __2018-01-13 20:25:11__

> I'm trying to use it because I am sick but it won't let me save any of my information on it on the profile everytime I hit the save button it just spins a circle like it saving but then if I go back out of it because it does nothing afterwards it just cleared everything out and nothing gets saved so I really never got to use the app at all<br> :date: __2017-09-12 18:56:17__

> App doesn't work.  Actually needed it last week and it failed.  Wound up going to the local urgent care instead.  Waste of time to even use it...<br> :date: __2017-04-27 20:41:02__

> The App only works from 8am to 8pm.<br> :date: __2015-07-02 08:10:07__

> This app is not user friendly. I don't understand it at all.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 22:26:35__

> When trying to schedule, it takes forever trying to reach the screen and then displays a non-English-readable (i.e. system code) error.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 19:49:07__

> This app goes from creating a new account to immediately wanting to book a doctor appointment and input a credit card#. No mention of copays, insurance, or how/when/if your health records are obtained. Overall, the app feels more like an old-school magazine subscription service with silly clipart, rather than a high-tech health app. During Live Chat, I was told that a house visit costs $189.06 (their website says $159). A phone consult is $189.06 as well, or "only" $79 if you pay cash. That makes this the priciest telemed app on my list of choices, and it is now off my list. I would have saved time and annoyance skipping this app and looking for telehealth services elsewhere.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 18:33:44__

> They canceled a vaccination appointment for my senior parent without warning and provided no help to restore the appointment due to their error<br> :date: __2021-02-07 04:43:11__

> This app interrupted my usage of it to ask me to rate it, which as per policy is an automatic one star rating.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 02:42:00__

> To many problems not honest at all complete lies Message me back<br> :date: __2020-12-03 20:03:50__

> Waste of time<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:57:43__

> Web shows 30.00 on site flu shots for the elderly, in this case my 89 year old mother.. Once you register its 79.00. Uninstalled app and will never use or recommend. Be honest and upfront.<br> :date: __2020-09-17 04:28:56__

> I can't sign on through Blue Shield. The app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 19:37:29__
