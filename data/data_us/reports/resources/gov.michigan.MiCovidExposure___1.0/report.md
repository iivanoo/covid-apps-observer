### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth ‚Äúkeys‚Äù (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert](http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert) |
| **Email** | mdhhs-micovidalert@michigan.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> I'm doing fine, I get check every 30 days at my doctors office. N so far I've been negative. Thank God, I feel for the ones that get it. But most that do get it they don't wear mask n do stay far enough apart. If everyone would just listen to the CD, or governor or doctors we could be alot lower in the spread. So I pray I don't ever get it. N I'm so stay back from everything good luck n thank you for ure assistance of how to deal with the problem.

> New to it but could be a life savior!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 21:27:57__

> Great app. It's private and low impact to my phone. The one downside is it relies and others installing and using it. It does provide some good statistical and links to general information<br> :date: __2020-11-15 14:17:04__

> Easy, and I like that it reminded me that it wouldn't work with my Bluetooth turned off (which reminded me to turn Bluetooth on!).<br> :date: __2020-11-14 23:09:39__

> I really am sick of conspiracy theorists.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 14:51:24__

> Great info, easy to use. My only suggestion is to reduce the size of the text box on the Stats page regarding Johns Hopkins along with the logo. It takes up too much of the screen on my Android mobile device. I can only use 40% of the screen for scrolling the stats.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 01:45:27__

> Great that I can be notified of potential exposure to covid-19!!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 00:40:01__

> I'm glad to have this, but the map doesn't work correctly. When I tap on a county, it just shows a blank page.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:50:48__

> Just checking it out<br> :date: __2020-11-20 08:58:10__

> Way to late and unlikely to work universally (eg. with folks from out of state) but it's better than the nothing burger we've had so far. Would be nice if it gave you an idea of how many contacts it recorded (Inna privacy preserving way) to let us know the adoption rate around us.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 03:59:58__

> Its a good way to b notifield about the virus<br> :date: __2020-11-14 23:32:03__

> Information is powerful for health and wellbeing.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 22:56:37__

> Remove stats tab. Why isn't this for any infectious disease.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 00:37:30__

> In the stats tab if you scroll to the map you get stuck unable to scroll outside of the map. Only solution seems to be to reopen the app. Might try making the map a touch smaller or making it a separate pop out window or something.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 21:25:25__

> This app is great, but it would be even better if we could submit a result that tested negative so that health officials can track this as well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:36:09__

> Hopefully enough people use it to make it work!<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:03:29__

> On the page "Michigan Coronavirus Stats" 2/3 of the page is covered with text about John Hopkins. To scroll the important information there is only a 1 inch window.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:59:18__

> Nice start, but it's deceptive giving static statistics. Need to do update stats daily or remove them!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 17:48:11__

> The county health department is so overwhelmed I likely won't be contacted to get the pin # to put in my positive test. I can have no clear idea of how effective the app is, but it's better than nothing<br> :date: __2020-11-15 14:33:26__

> Great idea<br> :date: __2020-11-15 00:39:09__

> I think the concept of this app is a step in flattening the curve but unless all Michiganders are downloading and using this how is its effectivenes Therefore, I think requirement of the app by all with smart phones or access might make it more successful, not only Michigan but throughout the United States. Matter of fact Everywhere this is a "Global Pandemic". Pre-installment (as other widely used apps are already installed on new phones) is a good idea as well. Please Consider<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:46:35__

> Being able to see a how many people in your area have downloaded the app would be helpful. Its far more accurate if my city has 5k+ downloads than if it only has 500.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:53:39__

> I am a nurse and have tested positive in April. No pin given. Won't let me submit my result<br> :date: __2020-11-14 09:22:03__

> I will it ever download, still pending After 5 Minutes<br> :date: __2020-11-14 04:23:42__

> We live in a weird ass world, ive been inside for months<br> :date: __2020-11-13 20:05:32__

> Too much text, especially when you try to look at John Hopkins pages. The notice about that fills half the page, the bottom icons take more, so you get very little info on the screen and cant even see that it is michigan on the map. Next topic: I also worry very much about being tracked and my privacy.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 16:00:48__

> Great idea & much needed. However... requires keeping your Location & Bluetooth ON constantly, in order to function. And that's a MASSIVE suck for the battery power on most phones. Devs need to change that, somehow! Until then, I'm uninstalling this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 00:53:19__

> Why are only 3 ethnic groups shown in the Statewide Racial Breakdown? The groups shown are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American/Alaskan Native. What about Asians? Middle Eastern? Michigan is made up of more than 3 ethnic groups and whites.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 15:22:42__

> Would be nice if the Stats screen wasn't 80% ad for John Hopkins. Would like to see better view of the stats.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:35:54__

> Would not come in kept trying<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:24:18__

> The main page with the stats has half the screen taken up with a banner crediting John Hopkins for the work. You can't minimize it and it hinders the usability of the app<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:44:08__

> You only have 1" to view info. Needs work.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 17:34:28__

> I wish this Covid-MI was more like the COVID -NJ APP it actually let you know if been exposed . Has a feature that circles They need to improve the Covid-19 app for MI Whomever developed should look at the Covid-NJ app asap<br> :date: __2020-11-15 08:12:50__

> Seems like a good idea, I'm not in a major city and don't work around large amounts of people so not sure how effective it will be for me. One thing it did I don't get since it says it uses bluetooth and won't ask for GPS, is it required me to have my GPS on to receive notifications! Everything I read about the app says it shouldn't and won't do this and it's not listed as part of the app permissions. If the app really needs GPS on they need to make sure it's known and listed in the permissions!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:59:23__

> The design makes it impossible to read the info in stats.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 03:17:19__

> Don't delete my review again because you don't like it. Oh look, a 'FEAR' spreading tool to manipulate the mob.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:46:56__

> Buggy - clicking "enable notifications" causes my Pixel 4 XL to freeze. If I hit power button to turn screen off... Then turn on again and press "no, do not enable notifications" then app works...
