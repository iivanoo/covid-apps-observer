### Description
> Now, board-certified health care providers can care for you or your child wherever you are, whenever you need them, from the convenience of your own mobile device or computer. From coughs and sore throats, to minor skin irritations and joint pain – we have you covered. An easier way to access both adult and pediatric care teams for urgent clinical care needs and common concerns – on your schedule, and in about 10 minutes!
<br>Your virtual visit may even be less expensive than your other care options, compared to urgent care clinics and emergency rooms.
<br>Simply download the app and register, and then select a provider and ‘click.’
<br>Once you select a provider, the online communication begins shortly thereafter! Telehealth providers accessed via the Penn State Health OnDemand app will diagnose, may suggest follow-up care, and can prescribe medication.
<br>Healthcare that meets you where you are and at your convenience; helping you feel better and return to your life sooner.
<br>Penn State Health OnDemand can be used for various common symptoms and concerns:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cough

<br>• Joint pain or strains
<br>• Lower back pain
<br>• Minor rashes and skin concerns
<br>• Painful urination
<br>• Sore throat
<br>• Stuffy and runny nose
<br> 
<br>The Penn State Health OnDemand telehealth program is not be appropriate for all concerns. The following symptoms should not be treated by a telehealth provider; go to the closest emergency room for in-person care:
<br>• Assault, physical or sexual abuse, or child abuse

<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Coughing/vomiting blood

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Penn State Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.pennstatehealth.org](http://www.pennstatehealth.org) |
| **Email** | innovate@pennstatehealth.psu.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Penn State Health 500 University Dr MCH162 Hershey, PA 17033](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Penn%20State%20Health%20500%20University%20Dr%20MCH162%20Hershey,%20PA%2017033) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The experience was ok. I could hear and see my Dr. clearly. The problem was my Dr. could hear me, but she could not see me. My video was on, I could see my picture in the corner of my screen.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 15:11:25__

> Great medical access tool. Its a bit cumbersome to navigate but allows quick convient access to Drs.

> It's great - when it works.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 16:55:44__

> Love Hershey!! On demand is great for those at risk! Thankful for this app! But can't contact a doctor that I had surgery with and who I need a note from after contacting the nurse's office multiple times.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 18:28:32__

> Visit summary does not include NPI number or tax ID number, both of which are needed for insurance. Also, they say Corona screening 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., but the day I checked every nurse was offline. This app can be useful for quick first Care service, however.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 18:42:33__

> I had a virtual visit scheduled today for my son. The doctor was unable to see our video feed on either of our phones even though we allowed access to the camera. We had to complete the exam over Zoom after several unsuccessful attempts to get this application to work. Other than this issue, it seems like a nice app with lots of potential. We tried the app on two different Galaxy S20+ phones.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 03:12:03__

> No insurance options except Highmark and doesn't work on Samsung devices apparently.<br> :date: __2019-07-07 18:45:30__

> Very unsatisfied, how can you see a child's throat through a damn phone camera, I'll never even go to that doctor's office again<br> :date: __2020-10-29 11:47:46__

> Keeps crashing, but even when it does work, the UI is terrible.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 16:03:55__

> Does not to open<br> :date: __2020-09-09 16:04:28__

> Not doctor related<br> :date: __2020-08-08 20:40:11__

> Got connected and it kept saying I was next in turn for 2hrs and counting!<br> :date: __2020-08-06 17:40:25__

> I logged in for my appointment, 15 minutes early as instructed, and the doctor never connected. I was left in the virtual "waiting room" for over two hours. I had to contact the doctor's office on the phone myself. The app now says that I "missed my appointment." The doctor's staff says I did everything right and they aren't sure what happened.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 19:02:34__

> Worked fine for me, until I added my kids. Now when I log in, it becomes a slow strobe light. Uninstalled and reinstalled, same thing, app chokes and tech support cannot see why.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 15:47:48__

> Crashed my phone, even when not using ....it runs in background.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 13:58:40__

> The app itself is fine but the issue is which insurance companies they accept. They ONLY except High Mark and not Aetna which is the health insurance provided by Penn State University. Bizarre, Penn State Health does not accept PSU health insurance. They don't accept Medicare as well.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 12:38:17__

> Not good talk to nurse and trying to get visit summary been a week haven't got yet<br> :date: __2020-03-26 16:45:32__
