## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great App! But, periodically wont let me log in.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 00:38:49__

> As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 23:30:04__

> Works well. Good list of resourses<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:45:41__

> Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 15:50:58__

> Very practical<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:31:00__

> The app is great and is very convenient specially sens you don't ever go anywhere with out our phones so you always have your id with you this way! I just wish you were able to use it at more places and able to use it to cash checks and wat not but besides those few things it's an amazing idea thanks alot<br> :date: __2021-02-14 06:06:20__

> In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:42:03__

> 2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. 👍When this app is working, its amazing.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 05:22:11__

> When and if I'm allowed to use this electronic ID to show to a cop I should be able to "lock" everything else so cop can stop and prevent snooping in my phone other than the ID itself.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 17:03:23__

> Can't get it to scan my id in????<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:16:20__

> Keeps crashing when I try to upload an insurance ID card. Everything else is awesome!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 20:44:35__

> pretty 🆒<br> :date: __2021-01-14 19:25:48__

> THIS APP IS HARD TO SET UP AND IT KEEPS REDIRECT ME .BUT NOT LETTING ME LOG IN<br> :date: __2020-12-21 09:32:36__

> This app saved my life but now it keep saying retry otp and now I can't use it for my I'd. How I'm supposed to buy my essential things with no I'd!<br> :date: __2020-09-25 20:54:47__

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> I'm sure it's a great site, but it does not let me create a site with my California DL.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 22:12:39__

> Damn camera will not scan the barcode on back of i.d. really frustrating if only I could use this it would save me alot of stress and help me alot at the moment<br> :date: __2021-04-15 12:07:20__

> In my house and put that in your house In<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:02:00__

> To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 01:43:26__

> Terrible third-party software for text verification and face ID.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 02:33:43__

> The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:30:27__

> MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 03:49:21__

> Can't start up error for days<br> :date: __2021-03-03 00:17:19__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> App is good in general, BUT, I HATE the facial recognition and such. Nice to have everything in one place, but not nice to give up things for it<br> :date: __2021-04-17 19:24:23__

> Proper information either not there or not accessible<br> :date: __2021-04-16 19:26:19__

> This app is no good because every time I try to make an appointment they would not let me make one they would say I had an error so here I see it with no ID and trying to get my ID for a year now and I still can't get it and and it's nothing but BS all they're trying to do is waste time I went down there and they had no one in the line no backup or nothing and I still couldn't get in to get my ID<br> :date: __2021-04-16 05:34:00__

> Just gives an error message and closes<br> :date: __2021-04-16 01:00:34__

> I've tried all day to get my stuff and it will not take a pic of my face to verify. Very sad.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 06:27:30__

> Is this app from the State's Office of Information Technology (OIT) or whatever it is called!? They are so inept!! It brought flashbacks of trying to license my ATVs a couple of years ago or using CDHS' Trails software upgrade! Tried the license bar code scan deal. No deal! No matter what I did. I will carry my paper license. DOW field personnel can't argue with that!<br> :date: __2021-04-15 02:35:29__

> Kicks me off everytime i try to show my id. Plus most places wont accept this form of ID. Give us a card like other states. PLEASE!<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:30:36__

> Tried retaking my picture a good 15 times and it kept saying it couldn't match my photo with my DMV photo. Tried uploading a photo instead but still no luck. I then tried to upload my picture from my ACTUAL license and it still didn't work. So frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 04:16:09__

> More security on this app to add my cpw licenses than forigen nationals require to enter the country or to buy a gun. Why can't I just log in with my cpw info and have my tags here?!? Just because you have a technology (ID scan, face recognition) doesn't mean it's merited.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 03:07:25__

> Can't Register, worthless. Crashes every time I try and take the photo of my bar code...<br> :date: __2021-04-12 22:03:51__
