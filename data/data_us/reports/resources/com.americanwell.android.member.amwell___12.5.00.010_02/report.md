## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Our insurance company recommends this. We have used it several times for rashes, eczema treatment, Pink eye. It was great. There was a hiccup on the cost. The normal price is $79, but our insurance gives a discount. Make sure you enter the access key or service code that your company gives, in addition to putting in your insurance. Ours dropped to $20.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 00:11:30__

> The visit was quick and to the point. He diagnosed my cellulitis due to an injury to my leg and called in a prescription to my drugstore. Much faster and easier as well as cheaper than an urgent care or ER visit. My insurance covered the entire cost of the visit.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 02:09:38__

> Pretty straightforward. Make sure to have a good wifi connection. Unfortunately where I live, we don't have great internet.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:30:33__

> Questions after ER Muscle spasms, severe pain, numbness.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:10:21__

> The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 21:04:16__

> I had sprained my ankle really bad and I didn't think I needed to go to a hospital and risk getting Covid. The doctor was great very informative and answered all my questions. The downside is the app has a section for emailing your doctor and the one I selected did not receive them. That information should of been on the description of the doctor. I also needed a doctors note she said she'd get it but forgot. Contacted support multiple times till after almost 2 days I got my doctors note.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 00:53:59__

> Dr responded at midnite. Ordered antibiotics. Able to avoid ER or acute care to possibly be exposed to Covid-19.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 05:54:30__

> Always updating, frequently have trouble with app, video connection pretty poor.<br> :date: __2020-03-22 15:54:59__

> not happy Dr never called me back my whole head was swollen and I needed antibiotics for an abscessed tooth didn't get them<br> :date: __2020-03-05 19:02:19__

> I have been having a great experience with both the app and Amwell services. It has been a god-send for me for many reasons. I am very grateful my insurance has teamed up with Amwell. However, as time went on I discovered the billing dept really sucks! I had appts scheduled and when I logged in I found that I suddenly had to pay for the visit out of my pocket, but my insurance covers it 100%. I was expected to pay for it and be reimbursed by my insurance. Like I have $80 just sitting around.<br> :date: __2019-11-13 14:10:22__

> Need to use it more. It's a good starting point.<br> :date: __2019-10-25 18:44:01__

> Its good but every tine i log in it makes me reenter my cridit card number.<br> :date: __2019-09-20 01:59:16__

> The look of the app is almost exactly the same as LiveHealth Online Mobile. Has WAY more insurance providers... But still can't find anywhere that will accept Pan America Life insurance. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2019-08-15 04:50:44__

> Disappointed off the bat. was sent an email from uhc to click and register to get an amazon gift card for registering. nada. its a good idea for doctors... help people out by making it cheaper and more accessible during the times of day when people actually get sick. so 3 stars.<br> :date: __2019-05-25 22:29:37__

> Basically an app to purchase a doctors note for work or school. The doctors or nurse practitioners seem terrified to write any prescription that isn't OTC. I deleted it.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 17:44:50__

> So frustrating to use. Never works right and I get over charged.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 22:35:46__

> The service is a great idea and fast. But the app will not allow pictures to be uploaded forcing a video visit. Once they get that fixed, it will be great.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 15:18:06__

> Video of my doctor was not good, nor was the audio with the doctor, we resorted to a phone call for the audio portion. I have been using " Doxy me " for other doctor visits and it works much better.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 19:12:11__

> Not the biggest fan, my insurance wasn't found but the company was listed.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 17:23:27__

> Waited with 11 people ahead of me, only to get to the front, wait another half hour, and then be transferred to someone else, only to be pushed back in the queue even more. When I got to the front of that person's queue, after 15 minutes the app forcefully logged me out! I feel terrible and this was 4.5 hours of my time wasted! Not cool! I really need to see someone.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 03:24:08__

> First visit for my son went great. Doctor was friendly and listened and helpful. Second visit was for me. The doctor couldn't even work his camera correctly so all you could see was the top of his head. He then was very condescending. He didn't even know about one of the medications I was taking (it's used off label for my treatment). He kept insisting it's never used for that I must take it for something else. 🙄 You can't go back to file a complaint.<br> :date: __2020-01-24 11:24:41__

> Don't be surprised that the app doesn't work just when you need it. Today is Sunday and just when I need it, it is not working. Not very 24/7.<br> :date: __2020-01-13 06:46:21__

> Like with all these apps. "Go to a doctor or clinic" I understand to be seen in person. Best bet is to not waste your time and spend more money<br> :date: __2019-11-28 00:51:01__

> My voice was gone due to a sinus infection and the physician that I spoke with kept saying speak louder. I had the phone almost in my mouth and she insisted that she could not hear me. My prescription was never called in to the pharmacy. I will never use this app again. This was a waste of money.<br> :date: __2019-10-17 05:41:47__

> Last Time I tried to Tele Visit a doctor. He was extremely rude and unprofessional<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:10:58__

> Not worth my time. Called for a uti, described my symptoms, mentioned several times that these are the symptoms I ALWAYS get for uti's. Doctor prescribed antifungal, and said if I get flulike symptoms, to go see someone in person. Really, wait until I have flulike symptoms to get appropriate treatment? During a pandemic? Thanks for nothing, jerk.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 03:06:24__

> Thanks for letting me spend $70 for a 10 minute visit for a doctor to tell me I need to see a doctor in person. Super (un)helpful Also I've been waiting to be reimbursed for two visits that happened in August and September. I sent the proof from my insurance that I should be reimbursed but it's been stuck in the billing department for over 4 weeks.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 20:00:28__

> Not very comprehensive. Nothing for chronic pain of any type.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 18:53:20__

> It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:31:48__

> It saying that it is not available in my area. I know I have used this amwell app before<br> :date: __2020-10-29 17:30:10__

> Dr seemed to get his medical advice from a trump rally instead of science.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 04:24:25__
