## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app through nuvance is quite good but the quality of talking or viewing through it seems to depend on the system you are using. It worked excellent on my android galaxy S9, but not at all good on my Acer chrome book but moderately ok on my Lenovo all in one desktop. For overall use its been fine and since multiple of my medical providers use it, the choice is use it or phone call with no video.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 19:57:20__

> Connection is spotty...not the best when it comes to that<br> :date: __2020-05-29 16:55:14__

> The visit was not as good as when i use othet apps. The doctor kept freezing every other second. The visit completely cut off once and the doctor had to reboot. It seemed as though every time she looked at something else on her computer the visit froze. Very annoying. We both kept having to repeat. The visit therefore probably took longer because of this. Also, i had given my medications to the assistant over the phone. But i spent 20 minutes inputing my medications and was late entering t<br> :date: __2020-05-14 18:09:05__

> Site kept freezing<br> :date: __2020-04-23 22:40:26__
