## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> *Love* the design and ease of installation. Good job Guam and Path Check Foundation! Bias toward action. I like the transparency around privacy, but I wish there were external links to a credible audit of the open source code so that the in-app marketing assertions could be 3rd-party verified. I don't live in Guam and don't work as a Path Check developer, so I can't judge how the EN functionality works, but as an interested consumer, I say thumbs up.<br> :date: __2020-09-11 19:29:00__
