## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Baptist Health South Florida |
| **Website**  | [https://baptisthealth.net/](https://baptisthealth.net/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Always a pleasure, the doctor's are so sweet and kind and even chatted to get to know me and shared a piece of their life making us relatable and all of us are human and these day's things seem harder and this service saves my mind and body by not having to leave my home for something "simple" they can help me with online.

> My experience using the Baptist Health Care On Demand app was pretty good. I was able to speak live with nurse practitioner Mrs. Carmen Lazo who really helped guide me through everything & figure out some other options as well to deal with the issues that I'm dealing with at the moment. I can definitely say that I'll be using this app more often especially when I can't reach my doctor or medical assistant at that very moment!! 👍👍<br> :date: __2019-10-30 19:57:37__

> App does not allow you a final review so if your DOB or address is incorrect, good luck at the pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 22:02:14__

> I would have preferred a face to face visit But given the circumstances I am satisfied with it overall.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 20:03:22__

> Difficult to install<br> :date: __2020-04-01 17:43:28__

> Horrible app. Can't even get past the payment screen as it declines my credit cards. Which are not declined. After getting the card approved finally, was able to connect with doctor after two attempts. Dr was bear personable and asked all the right questions. Was a good experience. My theory is that the data connection needs to be at a high connection speed as this app uses a lot of data. On Verizon here so usually isn't an issue.<br> :date: __2019-12-31 18:13:56__

> Everyone situation is different. If anything happens outside of the patient or doctors control be aware that you may have to pay for the visit like I did. I reached out to customer service about the situation and after 2 weeks I was told I still had to pay when clear communication with the doctor showed that the app was the fault. So be aware if you have a problem you may be still have to pay which isn't right.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 20:49:42__

> I had Covid19 in july 2020. I was atended 3 times, by 2 doctors. They prescribed antibiotics and fever-pain medicine. My point is, I told both doctors I was 2 weeks with fever, not getting better, but they kept saying I "eventually would be better". After 2 weeks, I started feeling short of breathness, when standing up. I decided go hospital. There, in half hour, they found 2 lungs compromised by pneumonia, and imediatelly started antibiotics. In 4 days I was back home.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:24:41__

> Doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-12-02 15:47:44__

> Was charged twice for their services. An authorization hold then an actual charge. Ended up paying an over draft fee because of being charged twice. Was not WARNED..that I would have TWO charges on my account. Sad because I needed help but ended up paying more than agreed on.<br> :date: __2020-07-20 15:15:39__

> Hate it its not free you ha e to pay in order to use the app<br> :date: __2020-06-28 12:23:55__

> Having issues signing in. Keeps crashing before I can even log in<br> :date: __2020-06-24 01:04:00__

> Paid for the referral, went to Mariner's and was still turned away. DO NOT INSTALL<br> :date: __2020-06-19 16:45:35__

> Called a healthcare provider for an absess on my jaw, she couldn't hardly hear but go ahead and cancel my session and bill me 60 dollars for nothing. But I can call back and get charged another 60 dollars I'm sure of that.<br> :date: __2020-03-30 15:03:39__

> Got on the phone and was assigned a Dr. who only had one patient before me. Two hours later I gave up. What a waste!<br> :date: __2020-03-29 23:34:15__

> Todo está bien con la atención de los doctores pero no llegan las prescripciones a las farmacias lo que hace totalmente inútil la aplicación para los pacientes y el esfuerzo de los doctores para brindar el servicio<br> :date: __2020-03-28 17:49:54__
