## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very helpful during the plague<br> :date: __2020-11-23 18:20:51__

> Decent for the most part. "Call" drops as program will automatically log you out mid sentence at times. Otherwise, much smoother than when the app was first presented.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 00:25:32__

> Trouble getting through<br> :date: __2020-10-05 20:06:58__

> Honestly love the App, it really helps during this time of pandemic and keeping people in touch with there team. Also it's great for when this pandemic is over bc its easier to actually talk about what I need to talk about instead of being distracted by the chaos of waiting rooms and Medicaid Cabs and stress. Just the comfort of your own home is nice when it comes to Mental Health. Only bad this is my video calls have dropped and there's no way to get back into your appointment if it glitch out.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 21:28:11__

> Depends on if someone else in the house is using WiFi or not on how well the video goes.<br> :date: __2020-04-17 20:09:33__
