### Description
> HEALTHCARE, RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
<br>The Virtual Care Anywhere app brings the doctor visit to you – when and where you need it. Within 30 minutes of requesting care, you’ll be speaking with a board-certified doctor or registered nurse practitioner.
<br>Our team of board-certified doctors and nurse practitioners are available 24/7 to provide consultations, diagnoses, and treatment via video chat or phone. No appointment is needed. Our team can also call prescriptions (those that are deemed clinically appropriate) into your local pharmacy. 
<br>Use Virtual Care Anywhere for common conditions, such as:
<br>•	Cold and flu
<br>•	Pink eye
<br>•	Rash
<br>•	Stomach flu
<br>•	Allergies
<br>•	Back pain
<br>•	Urinary tract infections in adult women
<br>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
<br>1. What does it cost?
<br>Each Virtual Care Anywhere visit costs a flat fee of $35, always. There are no hidden or added charges. At the beginning of your visit, the provider will determine whether your health concern is appropriate for virtual urgent care. If it’s not, you will not be charged for the visit.
<br>2. Will insurance cover my visit?
<br>Most insurance plans do not cover virtual health services at this time, and we cannot guarantee reimbursement. However, a Virtual Care Anywhere visit is a qualified medical expense and you can typically use your HSA or FSA account to pay for it. An invoice that you can submit to your insurance plan for reimbursement will be available through the web portal for your Virtual Care Anywhere account after each visit. 
<br>3. How does a virtual visit with Virtual Care Anywhere work?
<br>You will meet with one of our medical providers via phone or video chat. You can request a video chat through the mobile app, via our website, or by calling our toll-free number.
<br>Our website requires that JavaScript and cookies be enabled. If you are unable to access the website or experience technical difficulties, please call our patient concierge team at (855) 356-8053.
<br>4. Who is eligible?
<br>Virtual Care Anywhere is available to people of all ages, across the United States. Virtual visits are not available to those covered under a federal insurance program such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, or Tricare, unless you are specifically set up by your insurance plan administrator.
<br>5. Will my primary care provider receive my visit summary?
<br>After every virtual visit, the Virtual Care Anywhere provider will write a personalized visit summary that outlines the visit, treatment recommendations and outcomes. You can choose whether to share it (or not) with your primary care provider at the close of the visit. This visit summary is accessible at any time from your Virtual Care Anywhere account page.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great doctor and fairly quick response. I felt comfortable with the quality and care.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 17:03:14__

> Took a little while to see someone even though it said I was next in line. It threw me into another doctors que after I'd been waiting in another room for 10 min.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 15:50:19__

> Cool efficient experience.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 11:35:23__

> Took about 2 hrs to see a dr. But was very pleased when I finaly got thru. Stood in line 3 times and was transferred to a different on each time. Any way my daughters getting the treatment she needs with out getting exposed to anyone else's germs I'm pleased.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 20:21:32__

> It took me a LONG time to FINALLY get thru plus i kept getting switched back and forth from doctor to doctor but then I called customer support and was told to "choose a specific provider" instead of "first available provider." When I finally got connected to a doctor, he was a very nice, patient, and helpful doctor. Thank you 😊<br> :date: __2020-03-23 02:47:06__

> The Dr's on here are pretty nice and the fee is reasonable at only $30. I used this when I didn't have health insurance and needed Dr's notes for my work. However, this app has no support email or phone number. They have a "number" but when you call its just static. I emailed the developer email when I had an inquiry, and there was no response. On top of that, there's no option to delete your account or your payment info, if you want to stop using the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:40:42__

> The app clearly says you can use it to diagnose rashes but of course the doctor then says it's hard to diagnose rashes through the app and then guesses what it might be. I'll have to go in to a clinic which I was trying to avoid in the first place. The app is fine and easy to use. It would be nice if you could choose the gender of the doctor. I like the follow up message for my records. I liked that I could upload photos of my symptoms but the doctor I got didn't seem to have looked at them.<br> :date: __2019-10-30 15:06:21__



#### 2-star reviews

> Mediocre. Couldn't connect video, though every other video call app works for me. Call quality was iffy. There's no written summary of my visit?! No email. No receipt for my payment. No way to send a message within the app with questions. My local hospital system is linked to this and my virtual chart there has no record of my "visit".<br> :date: __2020-07-17 18:27:19__

> I was skipped over multiple times and put behind other patients after I had been notified the Dr was about to see me. This is pretty unacceptable. I'm guessing they felt other cases were more urgent than mine, when in actuality I needed to be headed for the emergency room. Very upsetting.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 06:42:22__

> Due to being late at night and unsure of current urgent care procedures for COVID opted to try Virtual Care. Talked on the phone to nice professional, who agreed with me on symptoms, will write a prescription for antibiotic and i can pick up tomorrow. Next morning i go to my pharmacy ( double checked to make sure it was the right one) they said no prescription was written. Tried calling on call nurse who said call virtual care and get charged again. Now sitting in urgent care anyway.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 22:48:25__

> free visit code doesn't work. can't find my login information. keeps switch Dr.'s<br> :date: __2020-05-02 02:41:48__

> The app works OK. I just can't believe I got charged $35 for a dismissive MD to spend less than 90 seconds to tell me to keep doing the same things that aren't working.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 21:19:01__

> Waste of money video dropped and $35 for them to tell me I have to go in and be seen. And that will be another Co payment!<br> :date: __2020-09-26 18:02:54__

> App is garbage. Has NO customer service support, a pathetic description of services and no where to input insurance information<br> :date: __2020-08-24 13:53:43__

> I wouldn't get connected for 2 full calls. Waited for 40 minutes for both calls. They said that they couldn't even diagnose me and that I still had to physically go to a provider. I wasted 35 dollars and now I have to go in and pay another 60 dollars. Save your money they like to say everything is associated to Covid. A simple stomach ache.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 05:42:02__

> This smells scam. Doesn't seem to belong to any network. Not even sure it was a real doctor who called me. Misspelled both my last and the first name on the referral to practically nowhere. Left me guessing "What was it?" I used the government sponsored code, definetely wouldn't give them my credit card. Some shady money making app.<br> :date: __2020-06-23 21:19:00__

> I just waited, not even exaggerating, FOUR HOURS!! Because I neeeed to see a doctor and get into one in person. After 4 hours and wasting most of my day I excited out just for me to see the doctor I was waiting on was still available. Very unhappy!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-04-28 00:56:15__

> Doctor didn't listen to me and his note reflected that.😒<br> :date: __2020-04-13 18:47:20__

> This was useless.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 20:42:12__

> I was disconnected right at 5pm after waiting in line. Then it wanted me to start over. So Rude!!! I do not want any charges for this app or appointment. 3.31.20 i just do not want any charges 4 this app coming out of my google play where i had 2 download.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 03:31:06__

> I started with 18 patients waiting that was for 4hrs, and when I was my turn, It transferred me to another doctor for a 53 patients wait. That's BS!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-03-30 09:48:03__
