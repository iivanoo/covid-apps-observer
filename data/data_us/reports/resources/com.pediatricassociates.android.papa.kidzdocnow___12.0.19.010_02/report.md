## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Convenient and u ser-friendly.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 08:41:15__

> Provider was informative and attentive. Wait time was better than office visit wait time.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 18:08:42__

> Easy interface, worked well<br> :date: __2020-08-19 22:06:36__

> Visually I can see the doctor very clear and audio was great as well. Overall great experience. Just wasn't sure about switching of the doctors last minute.<br> :date: __2020-07-09 04:10:27__

> Would've given a higher rating if not for waiting on a doc 10 mins then canceling and choosing another one who marked herself as unavailable while i was entering my info and then finally getting a 3rd one. It was smooth sailing from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-02 21:32:57__

> Super easy but make sure you and your provider have a solid wifi connection. We had some video issues which did thankfully resolve before completion of the call.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 13:28:26__

> The app works well. I do feel the camera capabilities could be better. I could not focus the image even though I know my phone is capable of doing so.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 13:46:28__

> Have used this app 3 times already and really like the convenience of telemedicine. One thing I would suggest to the App developers is if they could make this app work on top of other apps for multitasking. Then I would rate 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-03-12 13:37:10__

> Very convenient<br> :date: __2020-03-12 03:57:53__

> I coudnt see the doctor but he could see us. Still a good experience and fast service<br> :date: __2020-01-23 00:28:13__

> The app was ok but I could not see the doctor face and the screen to show me was very small<br> :date: __2019-12-18 18:37:43__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2019-11-20 14:34:47__

> l was not able to see the doctor at all, but she was able to see me.<br> :date: __2019-02-08 16:44:58__

> Needs a lot of improvements. I'll rate it again later on but right now needs work. It has a mayor issue with the login screen where the mask it use to hide the remembered email results in a wrong email or password message if you don't delete and write everything. It becomes a hassle specially when you're in a hurry because the appointment is about to begin and you have to upload pictures and everything. Please check the login experience there is better technologies available right now.<br> :date: __2019-01-04 19:05:55__

> Lots of issues with internet connection even with personal Wi-Fi<br> :date: __2018-07-04 03:14:13__

> Clinicians need to wear headsets to avoid feedback during calls. Took two hours to troubleshoot issues and I'm a Healthcare IT security analyst. App does not sync with patient portal / EMR natively which caused part of problem. Other problem is that for most Google users, the email coming from domain will go into spam. Pediatric Associates need to go with a full-fledged telehealth solution instead of this fly by night, TytoCare (AmWell) app.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 01:14:23__

> Horrible<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:25:18__

> Waited in line for an hour. Was next for a doctor and had the connecting circle go round and round, but never connected. Eventually the doctor disconnected. He did call to apologise and explain it was not connecting, but ultimately it did not work.<br> :date: __2020-03-16 15:49:37__

> Doesn't connect. Horrible tech support<br> :date: __2020-06-24 23:08:49__

> My doctor was Test Provider? Shouldn't be test data in an app, it's bad practice.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 22:41:45__

> Not downloading child has an appointment but app want download ðŸ˜ <br> :date: __2020-04-03 20:54:25__

> I was waiting for over an hour even with an appointment, on top of that I was never able to speak with anyone. I tried to cancel my appointment and couldn't do that because there was an error with the app. Overall it was a bad experience and i have a sick child with no one to talk to.<br> :date: __2020-03-23 17:04:39__

> Not one doctor or nurse is available.<br> :date: __2020-03-22 14:14:06__

> Terrible. I have been in the waiting room for over an hour even though i had an app. A nurse assistant ask me a couple questions and then the nurse never talked to me and then I was just transferred to another dr. And I'm here still waiting. Bs<br> :date: __2020-02-07 05:32:04__

> I rather physically take my children to the doctors office<br> :date: __2020-01-18 18:50:57__

> The app is a great idea, but they do charge you for talking to the doctor most of them dont even know alot and for that i can take the time and go to the clinic<br> :date: __2019-11-13 07:59:07__

> Overpriced. Classist. Our doctor's office plugs them. I downloaded the app and immediately deleted it when I saw there's a $59 copay even with insurance! Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2019-11-09 00:23:06__

> I would much rather go in office.<br> :date: __2019-10-06 17:26:45__
