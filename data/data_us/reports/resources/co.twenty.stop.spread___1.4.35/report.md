## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Stuck downloading at 63 percent. If you have this problem take it off Wi-fi. Solved the issue for me. Other than that easy to use except I couldn't find the option to add one of my kids.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 20:19:55__

Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 03:35:11__

> First, I'm not sure where the problem is? The wife and I had both the Rapid and the Oral Swab done exactly the same time. She had her Rapid results in a couple hours. I never recieved mine? I called the day after and got my results. The text and E-Mail notification was supposedly sent to me, I never recieved anything? This is not the first time. Last year, the same issue? So, if the app is part of the process there is an issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 01:04:15__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:17:35__

> I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:10:50__

> Does not work with older phones.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 02:14:33__

> Had same problem as prior reviewer. Trying to download app and it keeps hanging at 63%. Too bad. Guess I'll let it sit a while and see if it downloads eventually. :(<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:01:35__

> Unable to get paper copy of report to give employer<br> :date: __2020-12-22 18:47:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:49:30__

> All it does is show results. There is nothing in this app for tracing, etc. All it does is show your results and even that, they only appear hours, day after it is issued. Don't see the point of this app... Really.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:19:49__

> it's a good system, they just don't tell u the next step in this process, no one told me when to get retested or to self isolate, just a little more helpful info would be nice<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:30:16__

> Thank you for your suggestion. After clearing the Google Play cache it froze again at 63% (same as before). Then I had to cancel the download again and then try again and then it worked.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 13:18:36__

> Very difficult for older and others that Try to see results by phone.. I finally was able to confirm my appt Results are back today... Having issues to look at my result... Been trying for almost 2 hrs<br> :date: __2021-01-08 18:12:50__

> I have no idea what my test results are. If they are posted for my viewing, I'd sure like to know where.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 02:52:04__

> I can't get the date of birth in. It keeps throwing me out<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:53:40__

> I have downloaded the app and provided all required information. However I am not able to access my test results. It is trying to confirm and March my DOB with what the testing provider has in their system. Although the date is correct but the app isn't letting me access the result. I don't see any option to collect with the customer support. Please help.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 19:46:22__

> I'm trying to find my test results without any success. All i have found is Robert Smith. I assume its an example not a true person.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:29:14__

> None, yet<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:08:45__

> No problem downloading the app but it wont let me see results. I don't get past the birthdate and relationship question. When I called the doctor's office they said that they are getting many, many calls about this app and that every single person hasn't been able to get past this screen, and they aren't able to rectify the problem. Now what??<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:25:34__

> I don't know. I could not get past the "enter dob and relationship" part. I entered my information correctly. After reading reviews and replies I'm going to guess the medical facility entered something wrong. I thankfully have my results printed out from the facility so I guess I'll settle for what the hospital gave me.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:07:32__

> This site doesn't even work....... ! I can't even get passed log in!<br> :date: __2021-01-09 16:11:17__

> HORRIBLE!!!! I can't get pass B'day. Keeps telling me doesn't match. I KNOW MY B'DAY. IDIOTS. Starting to think it's just another way to hack and get personal information. Get rid of this app or FIX IT ASAP. Now the damn thing won't even let me send and/or post my review. Ill give it a 1star only to see if it will then allow my review to post ,but it actually deserves -100 stars. Yeah its just that bad!!<br> :date: __2021-01-09 10:54:02__

> Can't get by the birthdate@<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:16:04__

> Why do I have pay to get results, when my insurance company has already been charged, sounds like just another way of some agency making more money from a senior citizen that can't afford it. Down on east coast (Palm Beach County) even the test + results are free. I had pay thru my insurance company, otherwise no test in Okeechobee County, also saw County was only given 500 Vaccines for 70 yrs & older this past Tuesday, we have 20 x's that in this County, it's all about the money !<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:20:13__
