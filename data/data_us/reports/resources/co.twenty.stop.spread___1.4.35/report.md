## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Helpful but delayed results, I get my email with my results before I get notified on the app<br> :date: __2021-01-02 22:38:55__

> Stuck downloading at 63 percent. If you have this problem take it off Wi-fi. Solved the issue for me. Other than that easy to use except I couldn't find the option to add one of my kids.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 20:19:55__

> Testing was fast,easy.results were fast enough for me.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 15:41:07__

> Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 03:35:11__

> The app did what it was supposed to do. I had a little trouble downloading, but after that it worked for its intended purpose.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 18:08:45__

> My daughter and I took the test the same time and I haven't got hers<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:51:38__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-18 00:22:52__

> The app was helpful but would not allow me to change the date of birth to see other results attached to my phone number.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 18:02:03__

> I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:46:54__

> I had to attempt it twice before i was successful. I think i was in a hurry and stressed to get the results.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:25:58__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relatives results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:17:35__

> I work in the health care field and get tested twice a week and my job notifies me of my test results. There should be more instructions or questions to guide people. I had my daughter tested this morning so when I loaded the app do I put her information in, or my own. I put my information in and all of my test results show up. Will my daughters show under my information because it's the same phone number, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall it with her information to get her results?<br> :date: __2020-12-29 17:10:50__

> Does not work with older phones.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 02:14:33__

> Had same problem as prior reviewer. Trying to download app and it keeps hanging at 63%. Too bad. Guess I'll let it sit a while and see if it downloads eventually. :(<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:01:35__

> Unable to get paper copy of report to give employer<br> :date: __2020-12-22 18:47:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:49:30__

> All it does is show results. There is nothing in this app for tracing, etc. All it does is show your results and even that, they only appear hours, day after it is issued. Don't see the point of this app... Really.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:19:49__

> it's a good system, they just don't tell u the next step in this process, no one told me when to get retested or to self isolate, just a little more helpful info would be nice<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:30:16__

> Thank you for your suggestion. After clearing the Google Play cache it froze again at 63% (same as before). Then I had to cancel the download again and then try again and then it worked.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 13:18:36__

> App doesn't download<br> :date: __2020-12-20 23:53:55__

> I have no idea what my test results are. If they are posted for my viewing, I'd sure like to know where.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 02:52:04__

> I can't get the date of birth in. It keeps throwing me out<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:53:40__

> I have downloaded the app and provided all required information. However I am not able to access my test results. It is trying to confirm and March my DOB with what the testing provider has in their system. Although the date is correct but the app isn't letting me access the result. I don't see any option to collect with the customer support. Please help.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 19:46:22__

> I'm trying to find my test results without any success. All i have found is Robert Smith. I assume its an example not a true person.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:29:14__

> None, yet<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:08:45__

> No problem downloading the app but it wont let me see results. I don't get past the birthdate and relationship question. When I called the doctor's office they said that they are getting many, many calls about this app and that every single person hasn't been able to get past this screen, and they aren't able to rectify the problem. Now what??<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:25:34__

> I don't know. I could not get past the "enter dob and relationship" part. I entered my information correctly. After reading reviews and replies I'm going to guess the medical facility entered something wrong. I thankfully have my results printed out from the facility so I guess I'll settle for what the hospital gave me.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 19:07:32__

> It keeps asking for my password and there is none. So every time, I had to ask for a new pin! Stupid!<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:03:20__

> Horrible unable to activate code,constance restart<br> :date: __2020-12-30 12:39:23__
