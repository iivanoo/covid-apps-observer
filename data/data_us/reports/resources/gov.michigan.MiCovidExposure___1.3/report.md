### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert](http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert) |
| **Email** | mdhhs-micovidalert@michigan.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Started updating after reinstall. Turned on power management exception. Seems to be working again. Developer responds quickly. Edit: Hasn't checked exposure since 1/4/21. Seems stuck. Checked google exposure over past 14 days. Contained no data. Wish there was a way to force a check/notification update. Reinstalled. Still not updating Original: Low battery consumption. Exceptional privacy. No location tracking. Low data use. Not invasive.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:00:11__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-03 15:23:08__

> Stopped notifying me/updating alerts. Uninstalled app then reinstalled it. Alerts commenced once agai Have had first vaccine on 9th of January.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:08:14__

> I give it 4 stars needs improvement . but still great app.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:38:23__

> I will if it ever downloads, still pending After 5 Minutes, tried again a few days later and it downloaded right away<br> :date: __2020-12-04 05:11:59__

> Sits quietly in the background doing it's thing with no battery degradation. Like to see a tab to show vaccination verification because eventually schools, businesses, concerts, theaters, airlines, etc will want to see proof of vaccination.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:55:30__

> So far I havent seen anything about exposures. It would be good if they told me how my county and town is doing.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:31:22__

> Just checking it out<br> :date: __2020-11-20 08:58:10__

> Way to late and unlikely to work universally (eg. with folks from out of state) but it's better than the nothing burger we've had so far. Would be nice if it gave you an idea of how many contacts it recorded (Inna privacy preserving way) to let us know the adoption rate around us.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 03:59:58__

> I have the current version 1.3 but never updates checks for covid exposure after install Edit: I changed the settings that stopped app from running in background (Samsung). Hope that works.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 20:32:48__

> You have to keep Bluetooth on to recieve alerts?! No thank you, I'm uninstalling this Edit In response to the reply below: I still dont want to walk around with my bluetooth on all day. Thats not good for my battery or privacy.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 20:01:37__

> Used to work but now it hasn't checked for exposure since Feb 13th. It's up to date, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, phone restart, checked permissions. Nothing has worked. I'm uninstalling because it's not worth the waste of space.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 02:06:51__

> No notifications??? I worked in a hospital filled with COVID patients during an outbreak. Maybe none of them had this app installed. This app is an amazing concept. I apperciate the anonymity. I will continue to recommend this app to others!<br> :date: __2021-01-14 13:15:04__

> It was working fine updating regularly. Now it hasn't updated my exposure or the cases and deaths since January 4th. I don't know what is wrong. Yes my bluetooth is on. I don't know what to do with it.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:51:43__

> My app hasn't checked for any exposures since Feb 6th. I don't have an update option, and all permissions are granted. Frustrating. - I tried to export and nothing happens on my end. I clicked "export" and I didn't have the option to view or email anything over.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 16:14:37__

> This app is a great idea, but seems that it could be a bit more transparent. I appreciate that the app does not track me in any identifiable way, but I think it would be helpful to have more personalized statistics. Right now, the only thing we know is when the app last checked for exposures. I think it would be helpful to know how many unique IDs were gather over the last day. That way we can determine if the people around us are using the app and that the app is actually gather data fromothers<br> :date: __2021-03-10 18:59:41__

> I've had to reinstall this app on a few occasions.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 18:05:14__

> Data is old and hasn't been updated. I dont trust that this would help keep me safe at ALL ETA: Added star because of the response from the developer, but data is still wrong. Michigan covid deaths specifically. When the average person can get accurate data by using a quick Google search, I would much rather be able to open my app and get all data available as ACCURATELY as possible.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 16:56:29__

> Doesn't update cases counts and deaths data<br> :date: __2021-02-22 19:53:15__

> Does not update<br> :date: __2021-02-14 13:28:30__

> The app does NOT update as it should! It unexpectedly will stop and the only alternative is to delete it and then reinstall it. I have done this 3x....<br> :date: __2021-01-19 14:05:19__

> Haven't had a logged exposure check since Dec 27 with no way to refresh.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:37:22__

> Why isn't there a Caucasian stat on the racial breakdown...?<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:00:36__

> I've been in direct contact with 3 people who have tested positive. This app didn't notify me if a single thing. Seems pointless.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 19:14:18__

> I have had this app installed for 3 months and I am out and about all the time. According to this app I have never even been close to anyone with the "disease". You must be kidding me. With the whole country shut down because of this I must have been near someone by now. What a joke. Either make it work or trash it. You are supposed to be protecting peoples lives but you are just giving false hope. If that is your answer then the whole idea doesn't work and this is a total failure.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 17:25:47__

> It is the best game ever but covid19 the worst theres a lot of videos tho But it still the best<br> :date: __2021-03-10 02:08:28__

> I checked the app and the last update was 12 days ago. What good is that? I did make sure that the app is not sleeping in settings. Update: removed and reinstalled app, worked for a few days. Last update was 4 days ago. Total waste of our tax money. These people should feel guilty talking public money for this trash. FYI, I have version 1.3<br> :date: __2021-03-09 00:48:45__

> How do we not get an alert to update the app? We've all had been walking around for a month or 2 with an app that needed an update that we didnt know about. Since my app stopped checking for exposures in january, will i be notified if the past few weeks i had an exposure? I just uninstalled and reinstalled. Honestly, how was no notification sent out about updating the app?<br> :date: __2021-03-06 17:29:22__

> Uninstalled APP. Hasn't updated in 3 weeks, even after installing the March 5 update that I see has been the response to everyone who has also reported it doesn't update. Simply don't waste your time with this APP.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 12:39:55__

> I've had this app since it came out. It worked fine until around December, then updates were more sporadic. Now it says it hasn't checked for exposures since 10 am February 13. For the past two weeks, I have tried all the troubleshooting tips offered in the responses to poor reviews. Guess it's a good thing I've had both my shots since I'll never know if I've been exposed or not. I work in a public space, so I do leave the house and am around dozens of strangers every day.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 14:57:42__
