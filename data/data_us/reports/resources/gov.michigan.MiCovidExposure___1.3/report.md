### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert](http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert) |
| **Email** | mdhhs-micovidalert@michigan.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> I am not sure how useful this app is. It does what is says it does - monitors for possible exposure to covid-19 virus. Please note that the new version corrected the problems with the prior version.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 15:44:26__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-03 15:23:08__

> I have the current version 1.3 but never updates checks for covid exposure after install Edit: I changed the settings that stopped app from running in background (Samsung). Hope that works.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 20:32:48__

> You have to keep Bluetooth on to recieve alerts?! No thank you, I'm uninstalling this Edit In response to the reply below: I still dont want to walk around with my bluetooth on all day. Thats not good for my battery or privacy.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 20:01:37__

> Used to work but now it hasn't checked for exposure since Feb 13th. It's up to date, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, phone restart, checked permissions. Nothing has worked. I'm uninstalling because it's not worth the waste of space.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 02:06:51__

> No notifications??? I worked in a hospital filled with COVID patients during an outbreak. Maybe none of them had this app installed. This app is an amazing concept. I apperciate the anonymity. I will continue to recommend this app to others!<br> :date: __2021-01-14 13:15:04__

> It was working fine updating regularly. Now it hasn't updated my exposure or the cases and deaths since January 4th. I don't know what is wrong. Yes my bluetooth is on. I don't know what to do with it.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:51:43__

> The app is ON but has not done an exposure check since Jan 24. Today is Mar 18.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 16:34:13__

> Good idea, but app stops updating/checking from time to time and won't refresh or reconnect. Tried turning bluetooth off/on, restarting phone, but couldn't make it active again. Last check was over a month ago. Is COVID over?<br> :date: __2021-03-19 01:17:23__

> I've had to reinstall this app on a few occasions. No it is still displaying last checked March 08, 2021.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 15:11:09__

> The app stopped scanning so I redownloaded it and it still doesn't update. Also, not sure how effective it really is since sharing if you've trsted positive for covid is by choice and I'm pretty sure most people in my area haven't even heard about the app and if they have, probably wouldn't choose to share.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 20:50:17__

> My app hasn't checked for any exposures since Feb 6th. I don't have an update option, and all permissions are granted. Frustrating. - I tried to export and nothing happens on my end. I clicked "export" and I didn't have the option to view or email anything over.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 16:14:37__

> This app is a great idea, but seems that it could be a bit more transparent. I appreciate that the app does not track me in any identifiable way, but I think it would be helpful to have more personalized statistics. Right now, the only thing we know is when the app last checked for exposures. I think it would be helpful to know how many unique IDs were gather over the last day. That way we can determine if the people around us are using the app and that the app is actually gather data fromothers<br> :date: __2021-03-10 18:59:41__

> Data is old and hasn't been updated. I dont trust that this would help keep me safe at ALL ETA: Added star because of the response from the developer, but data is still wrong. Michigan covid deaths specifically. When the average person can get accurate data by using a quick Google search, I would much rather be able to open my app and get all data available as ACCURATELY as possible.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 16:56:29__

> Doesn't update cases counts and deaths data<br> :date: __2021-02-22 19:53:15__

> Does not update<br> :date: __2021-02-14 13:28:30__

> The app does NOT update as it should! It unexpectedly will stop and the only alternative is to delete it and then reinstall it. I have done this 3x....<br> :date: __2021-01-19 14:05:19__

> Has not checked for exposure since Feb 20, 2021.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 01:31:18__

> Has stopped checking. It's been six weeks since the last check. App is really useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 12:35:37__

> This app would be a great tool for reporting a result if it didn't require an hour on the phone with people who have no idea the app exists!<br> :date: __2021-03-24 19:01:25__

> It worked well initially but its last check was in February and nothing I do (sort of uninstalling/reinstalling) will get it to check again. I turned off all the battery saver options on my phone, nothing limits it at all, and yet suddenly it just doesn't work. An app like this is exactly what we need right now but it's only good if people install and use it, and we can't use it so there's no point installing it.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 22:31:32__

> Nothing but battery problems since installing.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 13:10:57__

> Says -0- activity. Michigan in 7-10 days went uptic 53% in cases. We have the variant. Useless. Questions below presume I have pre-knowledge of 3 subjects. This is useless. ABSOLUTELY USELESS.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 18:53:40__

> Works for a few days then stops. It says it's on but no readings for two weeks. Reloaded twice. Still don't work right. Reloaded as you said to. Still no readings since the 23rd. Installed and Uninstaller 6 times. Still not working right. Last exposure check was on the 13th. The app is an excellent idea just wish it would work.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 15:51:41__

> I am giving up on this app. It stops checking. I reload it. It works for a few days and stops. It is partcularly likely to stop checking when I leave home to shop or go to the doctors, exactly when I need it. I do not have a Samsung phone. Battery saving is turned off for this app. I open it daily to keep it active. All other apps work. The fact is that this app simply does not work.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 01:16:52__

> Constantly stops checking . Need to Uninstall and reinstall every few days. edit: that sites instructions are terrible. I tried multiple times to figure it out. And needed to do anything extra to get your app to work still means it's terrible and deserves 1 star. EDIT AGAIN: yeah those instructions aren't exact, but I did it and the app would still stop checking after a couple days. Even if I opened the app every single day. No one should have to change settings for this to work.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 16:20:36__

> Everyone has sams complaint. Time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:08:35__
