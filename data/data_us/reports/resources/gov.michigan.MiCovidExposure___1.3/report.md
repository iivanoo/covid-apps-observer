### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth ‚Äúkeys‚Äù (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Today is 2/24, the last scan was on 1/24. Leave it to the government to create a useless app. Once the problem was fixed, it's working good now!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 22:16:18__

> I am not sure how useful this app is. It does what is says it does - monitors for possible exposure to covid-19 virus. Please note that the new version corrected the problems with the prior version.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 15:44:26__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-03 15:23:08__

> App is so-so. For some reason it stopped checking data back in February (three months ago) without notifying me. Going to uninstall and reinstall to reset it. Regardless, it should notify every few days if the last check exceeds two weeks.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 23:56:28__

> Even though the app does it's intended job, there is a serious flaw in the fact that most of the people that I've introduced this app to, have said that it is useless. People don't understand the value of self reporting that well. A better approach is if the app presented some updated infection numbers and link to the Local Health Department Vaccine Information website and vaccines.gov to entice people to install this app as their one stop shop for COVID information and vaccination in order to make reporting a no brainer rather than something people have to be cognizant about independently.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 04:51:51__

> It seems that the app stops working at times. I have had to uninstall and reinstall it now three times. I look at it daily to see if I've encountered anybody with covid and three times I have looked at it and the last notification was days before. So I have had up to four or five days when it did not update. Of course this happened while I was with somebody who I found out had covid so I was not notified by the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 12:15:41__

> More tools for the Vaccine! The app is great but is lacking major portions that should be on the subject of "Vaccinations". Such as locations for Detroit residents. Information on the various vaccines available & where. A Q & A section on possible vaccine info to help stop forms of "vaccine hesitency"<br> :date: __2021-05-02 22:22:13__

> I have the current version 1.3 but never updates checks for covid exposure after install Edit: I changed the settings that stopped app from running in background (Samsung). Hope that works.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 20:32:48__

> You have to keep Bluetooth on to recieve alerts?! No thank you, I'm uninstalling this Edit In response to the reply below: I still dont want to walk around with my bluetooth on all day. Thats not good for my battery or privacy.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 20:01:37__

> This app is general , can be improved to reflect local zip codes with real time case tracking. Racial distribution makes this app racist.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 03:41:17__

> The last time the Exposure Notification updated was on April 18, it should update more often.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 06:13:25__

> You need a pin number to report a positive Covid result. I called and left a message, but they never called me back. So... that renders this app useless, aside from Covid news & numbers.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 07:10:17__

> I have to Uninstall the app and reinstall it because it randomly stops checking for exposures. EDIT: UPDATE: after following the instructions above about battery power it got WORSE. It not only stops checking for exposures but drains my phone . I would change the rating to Zero if I was able. Lots of other States got it right, did Michigan order their App from Wish?<br> :date: __2021-04-29 17:26:38__

> Great idea but the last time it checked says March 18. Needs a way to display our vaccine information.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 17:21:30__

> Exposures was last checked mid-February despite having bluetooth on all the time and occasionally opening the app.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 16:38:55__

> I haven't had any positive exposures according to the app, but how do I even know if anyone else is using it? I wish there was a way to tell if I've even come into contact with anyone who is actually USING the app. Just a count. I'm not asking for names or any other personal data. Without this count the results are meaningless.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 17:03:53__

> I tested positive for COVID-19. I wanted to share it in the app so I could alert others. When you test positive, the DoH gives you a PIN that you then enter into the app to verify your positive test result, which should broadcast it on the app. But here's the major problem: it didn't recognize the TWO PINs they sent me. I tried phoning someone, but had no idea who to contact. I was desperate to get the word out, because I work in a busy location. Nothing worked. I tried the codes again and again, but the app kept rejecting them, saying that it wasn't a valid code. I called the admin office-- I think???-- of the local health department, because I had no idea who else to contact to help me. All I did was call the number the app gave me. No responses from anyone. I'm starting to think this is happening with other positive testers as well, and that's why exposures aren't properly updated. Because of this, this app is LITERALLY. POINTLESS. Please do something about this. I tried to inform as many people as possible, but I can't reach out to everyone.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 15:45:58__

> I tried the app but have to uninstall and re install every couple of days because it stops working.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 22:46:51__

> The app is ON but has not done an exposure check since Jan 24. Today is Mar 18.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 16:34:13__

> Good idea, but app stops updating/checking from time to time and won't refresh or reconnect. Tried turning bluetooth off/on, restarting phone, but couldn't make it active again. Last check was over a month ago. Is COVID over?<br> :date: __2021-03-19 01:17:23__

> I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times. I had it set to run in the background, to never sleep, and it still won't update the last time it checked for exposure; it's been weeks. Instead of blaming everyone's problems on their phones or settings, how about taking ownership and just fixing the app?
