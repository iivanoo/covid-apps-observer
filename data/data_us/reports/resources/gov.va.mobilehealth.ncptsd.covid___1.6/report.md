COVID Coach is designed to help you build resilience, manage stress, and increase your well-being during this crisis. The app is free, secure, and helps connect you to important resources for coping and adapting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Customized tools are available to help you cope with stress, stay well, stay safe, stay healthy, stay connected, and navigate parenting, care-giving, and working from home while social distancing, quarantined, or sheltered in place. You can track your mood, visualize your progress, and find resources to seek additional help and support. No account or password is required and user data is not collected.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) |
| **Website**  | [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/appvid/mobile/](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/appvid/mobile/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is such garbage. Nothing actually helps. I could litterally just google my problem and click the first link amd get more help than this.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 09:42:03__

> Covid19 not real because tree give free oxygen<br> :date: __2021-03-02 02:34:37__

> Why do I have to allow this app to access my photos? I installed it and uninstalled. Please, explain why need access to my files .<br> :date: __2021-02-26 23:48:21__

> Requires access to your photos and files just to open the app. No thanks.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 01:54:50__

> App keeps crashing! Just use the older PTSD Coach, its basically the same thing.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 02:23:22__

> There should be no reason this app needs media, phone and Gallery permissions just to launch. Especially when it prompts you that you can disable them later.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 21:17:59__

> I was excited for this app. Unfortunately this app REQUIRES access to your phone. After downloading, a prompt will say: "Allow Covid Coach to access photos, media, and files on your device?" As soon as I tap on "deny" the app automatically closes and locks me out of the service. How is this supposed to be helping me? You don't need access to my phone. I'm disappointed.<br> :date: __2020-05-20 07:46:26__
