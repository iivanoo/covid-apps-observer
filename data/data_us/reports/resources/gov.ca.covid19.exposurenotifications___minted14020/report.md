### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State‚Äôs COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users‚Äô privacy, these keys are only kept on the user‚Äôs own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

> Simple to use. Makes sense. Everyone needs to install this and report if / when they get a positive test.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 19:21:20__

> People are worried about this app collecting and/or sharing information. Know what? I don't really care if it does, if it helps protect even one person, it has served it's purpose and been valuable! All three remaining members of my family have tested positive for CoVid-19 leavin mom in a CoVid ward, dad on a ventilator 3 days, and sister isolating at home a week. Please help yourself, family, and those around you and install this app for your Android device today! Here's to good health for all!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:46:35__

> If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br> :date: __2020-12-13 08:45:47__

> For those asking why the app asks for location: on Android 10 and below, Bluetooth access is tied to the location permission. The app does NOT use GPS or WiFi location data.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 07:37:43__

> Great app<br> :date: __2020-12-13 02:51:35__

> Simple and works<br> :date: __2020-12-12 21:26:37__

> Simple to setup. Hope more folks install it soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 21:19:52__

> Great app, wish everyone would download and help in contact tracing. This should not be optional when it's matter of life and death.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 17:53:51__

> I feel safer with this ap.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:00:53__

> Getting COVID-19 has never been easier! Download the app, party like never before, and vo√≠la! the virus is yours for the taking! Make sure to stay in large groups, don't wear a mask, and be within 6 feet of friends and family members for optional effect. I got a notification within days saying I was near an "infected" person; now you can too!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 09:14:39__

> Notifications didn't work at first, but I got a notification saying update Google Play services and now it works. Meanwhile, I want to remind everyone that covid is deadlier than the flu, especially since there's no vaccine available yet. Also, even if you're young and healthy, you could come into contact with people who are older or immunocompromised, who could get pretty sick. So it's good to know if you have covid so you can stay at home. Let's work together to end this pandemic sooner!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 04:12:10__

> Before posting statistics on survival rates, please cite the source of your data and have a basic understanding of STATISTICS. The data collected is essential to combating the virus. You can't measure what you don't know!<br> :date: __2020-12-11 21:23:48__

> I was thinking a great additional feature to this app would be to create a "social bubble score" (SBS) with the information collected during the last 14 days. If every user had an SBS based on the number and duration of contacts with other users this would help people determine a more accurate estimated size of their social bubble. Contact with users with a higher SBS would obviously have a greater impact than users with a lower SBS.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 21:15:16__

> Easy to install<br> :date: __2020-12-11 05:28:16__

> So far it seems to fulfill its objective<br> :date: __2020-12-10 19:20:11__

> I've waited so long for this app! Only one issue so far: The app encourages you to share your test results, "especially if you have tested positive," which implies that you can share negative test results as well, no? But the "Share COVID-19 test result" button only prompts you for a verification code... which is only given for positive results, right? Am I missing something? Or was the description under the "Notify Others" tab simply written using ambiguous/misleading language?<br> :date: __2020-12-10 14:13:18__



#### 3-star reviews

> Rated 3 stars for the following reasons. 1) This app assumes the person who tested positive will actually enter the code. 2) The person who tested positive is dumb enuph to not self quarantine and knowingly risk exposing others.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 10:26:26__

> Not sure it actually works. I work at a business that has had multiple positive Covid-19 tests...and this app hasn't pinged a single one.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 07:16:37__

> Okay<br> :date: __2020-12-11 19:28:58__

> Im concerened by the fact that I can be hacked through bluetooth. Luckily not everyone is walking around hacking, but still...<br> :date: __2020-12-11 03:14:54__

> So if someone tests positive, they download the app and enter in the health provider code so others with the app are notified? Shouldn't someone who tests positive be quarantining at home? Why would this app be useful to anyone? If someone is positive and doesn't stay at home, what's the likelihood they are going to install this app? Is an antibody test considered positive or just pcr? The only way would be to retroactively notify previous contact when you find out you are positive.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 02:36:55__

> SCAM: Vendors...offered boxes of 50 surgical masks for $70 each; used to pay $2.28. One solicitor stood out: Blank Industries, a company that offered N95 masks for nearly $5 each ‚Äî and only if ordered a million. demand for dwindling amounts of masks has resulted in a kind of global supply-chain shortage. In US, the federal gov. decided against taking over factories to create new stream of masks. Instead, fed officials are competing against states, hospitals medical suppliers while public scrd<br> :date: __2020-12-11 02:36:43__

> From Portland, or. hoping they have this app. over there too. I'm a private nursing assistant, here in cali-for work. My hope that people will continue to wear masks, staying home as much as possible and practice distancing. My advise, go to the store 1/wk. supply of groceries. Thought I would try this app. I can't rate it b/c I don't know how well this works. it won't let me submit this w/o rating, so for now, I will just give it a 3 star. Thanks again!<br> :date: __2020-12-10 22:44:58__

> Since installing my phone keeps crashing after about 1-2hrs of uptime. Will install again at later date if issue is fixed.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 19:51:44__

> I'd love to use this app, but it requires me to turn on bluetooth, which drains my battery. Why would this app require bluetooth to be on? Surely the location service would be enough? Is it a bug? I guess I can turn it on when I leave the house.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 19:36:51__

> Where is the the source code so we can verify the operation of the application? The taxpayers paid for it to be written. We deserve to see it, and it lends credibility to your assertion that the application is secure.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 16:34:56__

> The news reported it uses bluetooth but you actually have to have GPS on. :( boo<br> :date: __2020-12-13 01:31:18__

> Installation and operation seems very straightforward... However I will not consistently use this because it *requires* my location services (GPS) to be enabled. The documentation and press releases all claim that the application doesn't use your location. So... What's up with the GPS requirement? If GPS was used solely for this application I would consider leaving it enabled, but so many other services/Apps on my phone use this information in ways I would prefer not to participate in.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:22:07__

> While the description and information about the app everywhere says that it only uses bluetooth and does not track location, on my phone whenever I turn off gps it says that exposure notification is inactive and gps needs to be turned on for it to be active. This should be clearly noted in the description that the app utilizes both gps and bluetooth, though I am not sure why it's using both.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:03:12__

> Samsung galaxy note 5 user, 1 hour after installation my phone rebooted on its own, my settings all reverted back to factory default settings, including font, text size, wifi was turned on. Deleting until I have more time to read through the app information completely since I don't like surprises on my phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 00:18:11__

> Cannot use because I have to keep the GPS on which runs down my battery in an hour.. I have android version 7... So I uninstalled it...<br> :date: __2020-12-10 22:20:36__

> I downloaded this like 20 mins ago, and can't open my phone without like some sort of "welcome" message from the app. Would really like to know if I come in contact with someone who tested positive since I live with someone who is considered high risk. But I work a lot from my phone. So if this keeps up, I'm deleting.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 10:07:28__
