## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:52:12__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> Great info🚑🤗🦋<br> :date: __2020-07-08 16:35:23__

> I rarely use this App.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 19:25:04__

> I like the option to add current medications and conditions with the symptom checker, but the majority of my medications and diagnosis don't come up when I write them in the search box so I'm not sure how reliable that feature is, or the app as a whole (though we know it's not meant for a medical diagnosis).<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:25:54__

> This is a decent medical app good for simple medical issues. I found it doesn't work for me having multiple medical issues. It could use a place to enter actual lab results to help with the diagnosis.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 09:03:23__

> Good app but lately crashing alot on my galaxy since January update.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 18:04:03__

> No notifications after 2 weeks uninstall and reinstall not helped had to download another pill reminder app to track my pills instead shame as webmd is a good app<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:04:35__

> The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:54:00__

> Need to deliver still waiting on my prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-03 01:39:54__

> I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:18:03__

> This was a great app especially with the symptoms checker but now that feature doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 15:26:48__

> I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you.

> Your COVID19 guidance is all over the place. How can anyone trust this information or even yet make sense of it<br> :date: __2021-03-09 03:10:00__

> All the app keeps doing is giving me unfounded info about covid. Except for a few extremists and far out nuts, Most of the world is over it. This app used to be useful, but now every symptom seems to point to covid. That makes this app difficult to use because now you have to put a lot of thought into exact symptoms to get accurate results. No thanks!<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:38:43__
