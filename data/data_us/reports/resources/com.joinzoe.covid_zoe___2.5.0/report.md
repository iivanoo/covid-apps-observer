### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use with lots of access to local information<br> :date: __2021-06-20 12:50:03__

I am very grateful, especially to Tim Spector and John Campbell, for their untiring work.<br> :date: __2021-06-20 12:23:23__

> Some questions have too few choices. Example: My experience is neither 1 nor 2, so I am not able to answer. It is frustrating and you are not getting accurate input.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 04:53:57__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-06-20 13:23:18__

> Simple and easy to use..<br> :date: __2021-06-19 21:23:17__

> This app is quick and easy to use. I would recommend people use it to support collection of data re Covid. As someone who struggles with Fatigue I think there should be a 3rd category of 'moderate' fatigue.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 09:53:28__

> Interesting<br> :date: __2021-06-18 20:24:51__

> Am in Holland for family reasons. App choice of countries works fine for A to B but refuses to show more (last country available is Burundi). So I can't log my presence as The Netherlands. Please fix for me and others.<br> :date: __2021-06-18 12:17:46__

> Good information that I have confidence in and happy to contribute to create a source of information that is not politically biased or contradictory.<br> :date: __2021-06-17 14:27:26__

> I feel I'm doing a little something to help the research. I just wish I could choose the time of the daily reminders. I report for my partner as well as myself, and the notification pops up while he's still at work. I've gotten so used to ignoring it that I now often forget to report at all for either of us.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 23:34:45__

> For some reason I had a problem logging in and had to uninstall and reinstall app again otherwise very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-06-16 20:53:16__

> Hope the research is going well.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 12:13:42__

> I did not receive the extra surveys for mental health and Long Covid no matter what I tried so it is not representative.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 22:10:01__

> Have used this app for a long time until now. Its been stuck for a few days since my 2nd jab. When asked about symptoms near injection site the next button goes grey and I can't move forward so no longer able to report.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 12:26:18__

> A very worthwhile app in the current situation but now having issues with app saying I didnt report the day before when I did. Also cannot report today as it doesn't get beyond the screen 'Are you experiencing any symptoms near the injection site'. I click Next which greys out and then nothing happens. Not any Internet issue as everything else is working.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 18:15:50__

> I had my 2nd jab last week. I didn't have any reactions afterwards? But when I try to enter no symptoms from jab , the app freezes??<br> :date: __2021-06-12 14:06:46__

> Can't report as of today 12/06/21. In general app is OK but unable to add previous symptoms. When installed only basic information was required. There was not, and still isn't, a way of adding possible previous contracting the SARS-COV-2 COVID-19 virus.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:58:38__

> I haven't been able to report for days because I can't get past the long Covid questionnaire. Please can you offer the option to say I haven't had Covid and close it, or allow me to skip the survey altogether so that I can tell you how I am.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 17:50:29__

> What is going on. It asks me if I have had long Covid and there is no option to say No. The only option is Yes or unsure. A strange design choice for a survey.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 10:54:53__

> The new long covid question is stopping me from daily reporting. I answer the standard questions before reaching the long covid one off question. It asks me if I've had covid but there is no option to say no. If I select unsure, I'm asked about the symptoms. I haven't had covid but can't say no to bypass the question so my daily report isn't sent.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 09:37:11__

> The latest covid-19 one off questionnaire does not make sense. Like one or two others on here, I cannot exit the questionnaire even though I have never had Covid to the best of my knowledge<br> :date: __2021-06-10 15:37:54__

> A great source of genuine info and advice on Covid 19 it's a gigantic group app with around 4.5M people contributing their Covid symptoms that helps scientists help Govt to develop strategies for dealing with Covid. Do a good deed and join in - it only takes a minute a day. I've brought my review down from 5* to 3*, because the data downloads in the app on my Samsung S9+ are .bin files, not .pdfs and I can't find a way to read them. I have complained, but the response I received was that it was working for them, tough. Despite this, it is still worth putting the data in on a daily basis and helping to populate the report sent to Govt, even if I can't see it myself<br> :date: __2021-06-09 17:55:51__

> The app stuck on a questionnaire about covid and covid symptoms of which I have none but I can't get out of it. If I close the app and reopen it is back at the questionnaire with no option to say I haven't had covid and I've not had any symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 14:56:18__

> This app has been fine up until now, but being asked to confirm, every day, that my vaccination info hasn't changed (I've had both, so why would it?) and my tests... its bad design and its getting very annoying. Just put a button so we can report changes if they happen? Its making me want to uninstall it. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-06-09 12:43:13__

> For goodness sake get the graph axis right... 8 June 2021.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 15:05:45__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me 2 days even to to 5. I've emailed, no reply. I've tried everything I can think of to get an answer. Am I wasting my time doing this?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:06:11__

> Not very helpful<br> :date: __2021-05-18 17:28:00__

> This app has suddenly started misbehaving. It says it is offline when it is not. Even after reinstalling it will not open- it crashes. Annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:01:50__

> I send daily details but still have up to 3 reminders. Only way of getting rid of notification is to repeat . This gives false reading .<br> :date: __2021-05-10 18:59:47__

> App keeps locking me out, saying cant identify me, also i cant stay logged in after i get help to log back in, then im back to square 1.. ive been logging since the beginning daily till the last few days, it needs sorting for me to continue.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 20:08:38__

> No longer very accurate<br> :date: __2021-04-20 07:41:19__

> Doesn't seem easy enough to use. Can't see it going "viral". (Scuse the pun).<br> :date: __2021-04-15 11:48:20__

> Cannot send data about 2nd vacation as it's asking about symptoms and will not go past this section, press enter and it just hangs<br> :date: __2021-06-12 11:30:37__

> Trying to add second vaccine, and have got stuck on the side effects page. Press the Next button and instead of going to the next page, the button just greys out. I can no longer report my daily symptoms because it just won't let me out of the side effects page. (Usually this is a \*\*\*\** app)<br> :date: __2021-06-12 09:04:45__

> Won't open. Constant message saying offline.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:25:57__

> Can't complete todays log. After tapping "feel ok" app throws up a long Covid Questionnaire with no exit! I've never had it! Fix this or I'm out....<br> :date: __2021-06-10 09:06:29__

> Guys, you added questionnaire about long Covid which doesn't allow option to say you never had Covid. And you cannot complete your daily data entry without completing long Covid Fix it!!<br> :date: __2021-06-10 08:59:40__

> Doesnt differ from long covid symptoms as a reporting app<br> :date: __2021-06-08 18:24:45__

> Oh dear it's really gone to pot. I constantly have to enter my postcode and now can't report as the added questionnaire won't let me past question 1 as I can't enter a 'No' Please sort this out.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 09:38:00__

> Has up to date info but I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing. Update 30th May, tried reinstalling app yet again and still unable to log vaccination so think I'll give up with it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:41:22__

> Was good, but recent data appears to be incorrect. The data being reported for my area of the country is wildly different from the government data and local health authority data. I have emailed about the discrepancies but have heard nothing back. Have uninstalled the App now as I don't trust the numbers.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 13:06:03__
