### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> If it helps to track it and helps with understanding its nature of spread of Covid we should all use this app<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:17:40__

> They ask if you ever had a cobid test..if you say yes you cannot log in any info..mine was neg over a year ago so i had to say no to log in vaccine info..thus seems wrong<br> :date: __2021-07-30 04:32:43__

> Glad to be of help<br> :date: __2021-07-29 16:39:49__

> Well worth the time and effort<br> :date: __2021-07-27 16:57:04__

> I've been registering on this app daily for 16 months now. For data it's got to be worthwhile.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 17:36:30__

> I am not very techno minded, but I found the app very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-26 13:09:38__

> When updating my profile, tapping update doesnt move in. Cant get passed this point so cant log data<br> :date: __2021-07-27 23:30:44__

> I've used the app from the start and it has been interesting to see their estimates of the pandemic which had the ring of truth and were often lower than the official/ sage nonsense figures, so it was informative. However more recently and particularly since the 21st July methodology change the figures are far less accurate and show large increases when the opposite is obviously the case. Does government funding talk? Your credibility is now badly compromised in my view<br> :date: __2021-07-26 21:33:38__

> It's a good app. Since the last change to the figures the local cases graph detail view shows no graph, only the axes.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 15:46:27__

> UPDATED REVIEW FOR 22nd JULY 2021: the Covid map for my regional area of Perth & Kinross, for the past year is blank.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 21:14:41__

> I'm reporting every day but the app keeps saying I've missed 1, 2, 3 or more days! I haven't! If this is happening to lots of app users it's distorting the data. Please fix this error. 22/7/21 this is happening again. What's going wrong?<br> :date: __2021-07-22 10:04:07__

> Easy to use and non invasive. Top marks. 7 months later...UPDATE. Down to 3 stars! As the input of unvaccinated persons (we are getting few) is pretty useless to compile charts according to Tim, it has become an app for the vaccinated only. So if you are unvaccinated I would not bother with this app, your data input is insignificant. I am going to delete it.<br> :date: __2021-07-18 10:21:19__

> I don't like that the app uses extrapolation of date from a self selected group, I do not think this is properly representative of the population.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 12:19:01__

> Had some hiccups when it wouldn't accept my normal standard answer. But hey, up and running when needed, so worth persevering. And the data is priceless<br> :date: __2021-07-09 18:41:36__

> I wanted to take part, but after 3 days its already forgotten all the info I already put in about my vaccine ans stuff. I can spare 1 minute but I can't be bothered to resubmit the same info over and over.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 06:05:19__

> Unable to update details after PCR.test<br> :date: __2021-07-07 15:31:52__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> Could be much more user friendly & efficient. I cannot understand why there is no interest in tracking vaccine trial participants. At the least, there should be an option to select trial participant instead of recording the requested not vaccinated, even though I have been fully vaccinated since 12/2020.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 21:25:27__

> Suddenly stopped working. No functionality since 19 July 2021<br> :date: __2021-07-22 09:30:20__

> Cases projections are now very out of step with official figures. App says 30k per day new cases reducing, reality is 50k per day and growing. False security is dangerous!!<br> :date: __2021-07-17 15:36:16__

> Doesnt differ from long covid symptoms as a reporting app - i would find it useful to have a section on the longevity of symptoms<br> :date: __2021-07-12 17:42:05__

> Please add a small script to this app so that if I have already logged my symptoms, the app doesn't send a notification to do it. It's intrusive and very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 12:08:59__

> I've had to re-load this app four times since I started. If I hadn't been so determined, I would have given up long ago. I have an Android phone. Other than that- great app guys. I hope that better statistical science will be the result of your efforts.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 12:23:07__

> The app stuck on a questionnaire about covid and covid symptoms of which I have none but I can't get out of it. If I close the app and reopen it is back at the questionnaire with no option to say I haven't had covid and I've not had any symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 14:56:18__

> This app has been fine up until now, but being asked to confirm, every day, that my vaccination info hasn't changed (I've had both, so why would it?) and my tests... its bad design and its getting very annoying. Just put a button so we can report changes if they happen? Its making me want to uninstall it. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-06-09 12:43:13__

> For goodness sake get the graph axis right... 8 June 2021.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 15:05:45__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me 2 days even to to 5. I've emailed, no reply. I've tried everything I can think of to get an answer. Am I wasting my time doing this?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:06:11__

> Unable to submit daily symptom. When I click on my profile under "who I'm reporting for" it asks me to fill in additional info (race etc) when I do the proceed button goes blank and I cannot progress<br> :date: __2021-07-26 12:08:51__

> THIS IS GETTING MORE URGENT AS TIME GOES BY AND MORE TESTS ARE DONE - SURELY AN EASY CHANGE!Could the record of test results be displayed in reverse order as when you have taken a lot of tests it is a pain having to scroll to the bottom just to say the list is correct.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 10:21:50__

> Becoming increasingly irrelevant as the pandemic goes on. Seem to continuously change the method of calculation of infection levels with wild fluctuations. Basically a waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 12:11:24__

> Gets stuck when trying to update my ethnicity so I can't use the app to report. Sent email to support.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 12:14:47__

> Really good app, easy to fill the survey but I don't receive the daily reminders anymore... So I tend to forget<br> :date: __2021-07-12 19:37:39__
