### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The grafs X value 0 is visualy misleading above the lover line<br> :date: __2021-06-27 09:17:16__

> The app 'forgot' me for a while and resetting the password was not as straightforward as it should be. The 'login' function seemed unresponsive at several points. But overall it feels like a good way to contribute to the understanding of where this virus is heading, so I have stuck with it.<br> :date: __2021-06-26 17:35:01__

> Fairly easy to use<br> :date: __2021-06-26 12:00:52__

> Was hoping for more feedback on individual experience as CFS is so soul destorying, and I do understand that this is a information collect app rather than a one to one consultation app, but I would like more feedback and help, as general doctors surgery is only providing basic help...<br> :date: __2021-06-25 12:24:59__

> Good app and happy to help with this research. A note though in that the daily reminders have stopped again, I've gone through and checked all notifications are on but still no luck.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 11:49:26__

> Easy & quick to log, good to feel contributing to understanding of Covid 19. Weekly summary update from Tim Spector always balanced & interesting.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 09:46:25__

#### 3-star reviews

> A great thing to do to help research the epidemic. App itself is not that easy to use. I had to load it and try to sign in several times before I got going with it. First time I have up but then it came back to it.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 20:44:00__

> Great app, seem to be having issues recently with logging in, resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling hence 3*<br> :date: __2021-06-24 16:23:34__

> Fairly easy to use<br> :date: __2021-06-23 12:00:22__

> I did not receive the extra surveys for mental health and Long Covid no matter what I tried so it is not representative.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 22:10:01__

> Have used this app for a long time until now. Its been stuck for a few days since my 2nd jab. When asked about symptoms near injection site the next button goes grey and I can't move forward so no longer able to report.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 12:26:18__

> A very worthwhile app in the current situation but now having issues with app saying I didnt report the day before when I did. Also cannot report today as it doesn't get beyond the screen 'Are you experiencing any symptoms near the injection site'. I click Next which greys out and then nothing happens. Not any Internet issue as everything else is working.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 18:15:50__

> I had my 2nd jab last week. I didn't have any reactions afterwards? But when I try to enter no symptoms from jab , the app freezes??<br> :date: __2021-06-12 14:06:46__

> Can't report as of today 12/06/21. In general app is OK but unable to add previous symptoms. When installed only basic information was required. There was not, and still isn't, a way of adding possible previous contracting the SARS-COV-2 COVID-19 virus.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:58:38__

> I haven't been able to report for days because I can't get past the long Covid questionnaire. Please can you offer the option to say I haven't had Covid and close it, or allow me to skip the survey altogether so that I can tell you how I am.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 17:50:29__

> What is going on. It asks me if I have had long Covid and there is no option to say No. The only option is Yes or unsure. A strange design choice for a survey.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 10:54:53__



#### 2-star reviews

> The app stuck on a questionnaire about covid and covid symptoms of which I have none but I can't get out of it. If I close the app and reopen it is back at the questionnaire with no option to say I haven't had covid and I've not had any symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 14:56:18__

> This app has been fine up until now, but being asked to confirm, every day, that my vaccination info hasn't changed (I've had both, so why would it?) and my tests... its bad design and its getting very annoying. Just put a button so we can report changes if they happen? Its making me want to uninstall it. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-06-09 12:43:13__

> For goodness sake get the graph axis right... 8 June 2021.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 15:05:45__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me 2 days even to to 5. I've emailed, no reply. I've tried everything I can think of to get an answer. Am I wasting my time doing this?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:06:11__

> Not very helpful<br> :date: __2021-05-18 17:28:00__

> This app has suddenly started misbehaving. It says it is offline when it is not. Even after reinstalling it will not open- it crashes. Annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:01:50__

> I send daily details but still have up to 3 reminders. Only way of getting rid of notification is to repeat . This gives false reading .<br> :date: __2021-05-10 18:59:47__

> App keeps locking me out, saying cant identify me, also i cant stay logged in after i get help to log back in, then im back to square 1.. ive been logging since the beginning daily till the last few days, it needs sorting for me to continue.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 20:08:38__

> No longer very accurate<br> :date: __2021-04-20 07:41:19__

> Completely freezes on start up screen<br> :date: __2021-06-14 12:46:15__

> Cannot send data about 2nd vacation as it's asking about symptoms and will not go past this section, press enter and it just hangs<br> :date: __2021-06-12 11:30:37__

> Trying to add second vaccine, and have got stuck on the side effects page. Press the Next button and instead of going to the next page, the button just greys out. I can no longer report my daily symptoms because it just won't let me out of the side effects page. (Usually this is a \*\*\*\** app)<br> :date: __2021-06-12 09:04:45__

> Won't open. Constant message saying offline.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 22:25:57__

> Can't complete todays log. After tapping "feel ok" app throws up a long Covid Questionnaire with no exit! I've never had it! Fix this or I'm out....<br> :date: __2021-06-10 09:06:29__

> Guys, you added questionnaire about long Covid which doesn't allow option to say you never had Covid. And you cannot complete your daily data entry without completing long Covid Fix it!!<br> :date: __2021-06-10 08:59:40__

> Doesnt differ from long covid symptoms as a reporting app<br> :date: __2021-06-08 18:24:45__

> Oh dear it's really gone to pot. I constantly have to enter my postcode and now can't report as the added questionnaire won't let me past question 1 as I can't enter a 'No' Please sort this out.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 09:38:00__

> Has up to date info but I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing. Update 30th May, tried reinstalling app yet again and still unable to log vaccination so think I'll give up with it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:41:22__

> Was good, but recent data appears to be incorrect. The data being reported for my area of the country is wildly different from the government data and local health authority data. I have emailed about the discrepancies but have heard nothing back. Have uninstalled the App now as I don't trust the numbers.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 13:06:03__
