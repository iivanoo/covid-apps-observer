### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>HealthTap Prime. For a $15 monthly membership fee, you get:
<br>• Urgent Care visits, just $30 each. Available 24/7. For time-sensitive issues like fever, stomach pain, or dizziness. Connects you with a doctor in one minute or less.
<br>• Primary Care visits, just $40 each. Choose your doctor, see the same doctor for subsequent visits, and book appointments online. For ongoing preventative medicine and managing chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension.
<br>For use without insurance. HealthTap Basic:
<br>• Urgent Care visits for $80 each or a copay. Copay amount depends on the insurance plan. Many plans cover 100%.
<br>Primary Care is currently not available through HealthTap Basic.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>IMPORTANT: Just like with in-person doctors, getting a prescription depends on many things. For example, your doctor might refill your antidepressant prescription in an Urgent Care visit, but they’re unlikely to start you on a new drug. For managing ongoing conditions, it’s best to start seeing a Primary Care doctor on HealthTap who can get to know you and your medical history.
<br>There are some medications that telemedicine providers, including HealthTap doctors, rarely if ever prescribe or refill. These medications are nearly always prescribed in-person.
<br>Below is a sample list of medications HealthTap doctors cannot prescribe. The list uses brand brand and generic names based on what’s best known to consumers.
<br>Opioids and other controlled substances like:
<br>Adderall
<br>Ativan
<br>Norco
<br>oxycodone
<br>Valium
<br>Xanax
<br>Psychiatric drugs like:
<br>Abilify
<br>gabapentin
<br>lithium
<br>Lifestyle drugs like:
<br>Chantix
<br>Contrave
<br>Qsymia
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>1. ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>2. SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>3, ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.
<br>What people are saying

<br>HealthTap does not guarantee patients will receive a prescription, does not prescribe DEA controlled substances and may not prescribe non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is a great service with great providers. one downside though is that I couldn't get an answer from my Doctor due to the app being buggy.<br> :date: __2019-04-20 03:40:59__

> Symptom checker need further enhancement<br> :date: __2018-10-14 16:27:26__

> Full of bugs in new version, I can't open my notifications, I can't see my questions. Another thing is that you ask a simple yes or no question but the doctors answer something else.<br> :date: __2018-09-07 23:00:52__

> As much as I like this service since it keeps me from needing to go to a 
doctor's office, it needs work. I have done two consults now as a Prime 
member. My prescriptions were not actually called in on either one, 
resulting in extra time and visits needed at my pharmacies.<br> :date: __2018-08-03 15:34:35__

> I used once without an issue. Now I've paid for another consult but had no 
response from the physician and I keep getting a pop up about verifying my 
email but the link is never sent (I've checked all folders). So now I'm 
just out $50??<br> :date: __2018-07-29 04:51:44__

> Couldn't get to the unattended FAQ/Troubleshooting without obligations. Uninstalled<br> :date: __2021-02-28 04:50:42__

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:05:40__

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable. Just be aware that the free service could have you waiting quite a while for any responses. You might be better off with other services.<br> :date: __2019-10-03 13:28:51__

> stomach pain<br> :date: __2019-01-17 00:45:53__

> Was using the service for over a year and consulting with Dr Leslie Hart. 
They changed the service now I cant find her, get my meds anymore and have 
been going through hell. Thanks HealthTap for changing services on people 
who now can't get their meds.<br> :date: __2018-08-10 19:23:24__

> I'm not going to be paying for this after my trial ends, as it shuts down every time a consult begins. Doesn't let me do a thing. I already paid 19.99 and I'm asking for a refund.<br> :date: __2018-01-06 19:21:22__

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

> Wouldn't let me add or update. I kept trying but it would not work.  Plus it kept asking me to upgrade to add money.<br> :date: __2016-03-23 15:29:33__

> I've asked questions twice now without an answer. I guess now you have to pay if you want your question answered. As recent as last fall I had my questions answered within 24 hours. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2016-03-12 21:59:11__

> Stay away! If you're needing a prescription filled and needing it filled correctly do not use this app or company. They will gladly take your money but not make any corrections once they have submitted a prescription. My pill quantity was supposed to be 180 as I take 6 pills a day. They gave me 30, gee thanks guys just enough to last me 5 days. Worthless!<br> :date: __2021-02-14 00:41:39__

> I cannot navigate this app by<br> :date: __2020-12-29 21:31:46__

> Needed some medical assistance with my 11 yrs old. Down loaded the app and they won't allow him to be seen. My son has asthma and he is very susceptible to pneumonia this time of year. Dont want to take him in anywhere because he doesn't need to be tested for this stupid covid. So much for saying this is for families. Can't be if they dont want to help young kids.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 00:56:57__

> Tricked me out of $50. Don't use this. Thought I could get my standard medications from here. Nope. Was told they can't send anxiety medications. "Dr" instructed me that I had to be seen by my pcp. Kept my composure, thanked the "Dr" and canceled my account. Now I'm out of $50. Dont make the mistake I made. I'm going to go back to trying to get KHealth to work....<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:32:28__
