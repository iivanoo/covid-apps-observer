## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good experience , got the help I needed without having to make the trip to the Dr.'s office.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 15:56:23__

> This is the third time I've used it. Awesome!<br> :date: __2020-11-25 19:03:14__

> I have used the Virtual Visit service three times this year and each time was easy, private and efficient. I had a different provider each time and they have all been wonderful-- very compassionate, patient and knowledgeable.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:31:29__

> Outstanding<br> :date: __2020-06-10 14:31:44__

> Quick easy, and far less time than going to the emergency room...this time. : )<br> :date: __2020-06-06 17:51:57__

> Very easy to use. I had called the Hospital and with COVID-19 I did not have to leave my house. I will use this again. It beats waiting at urgent care, having to drive in, and they send meds if needed. Ea as y to upload pictures and the Dr. can view with your phone camera to examine the area.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 08:15:24__

> Exceptional, easy to use<br> :date: __2020-04-22 03:41:22__

> During this time of uncertainty, my virtual visit was awesome!! I had a nice clear connection with my provider who was great. She was able to look at my chart during our visit all while I was comfortably at home<br> :date: __2020-04-15 21:44:35__

> My provider was great! Everything went smooth and she was very understanding and helpful! I appreciate this app SO MUCH with having 3 SMALL kids at home this was the way to go! Thank you!<br> :date: __2020-03-22 18:57:40__

> Incredibly convenient. It just saved me an hour drive and untold time sitting in urgent care just to have a care provider take a peek at me. I'm a believer after just one e-visit. If it's something that a high resolution photo and a brief description of symptoms could handle this is the ticket. Doctor was very through and set appropriate expectations. Also you get to pick from a list of available doctors and you are able to review their basic credentials on there biography page. Mind blown...<br> :date: __2020-01-21 23:46:25__
