### Description
> Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service available on both iPhone and Android phones that helps slow the spread of COVID-19. If you have enabled Exposure Notifications on your phone, whenever you are within close proximity (approximately 6 feet of someone for at least 10 minutes), your phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can share these anonymous tokens, which will send a notification to anyone with whom you have exchanged tokens with recently, notifying them of possible exposure. The service is available nationwide, but will be customized for Colorado. This service does not collect any personally identifying information or share it with the State of Colorado, your Local Public Health Agency, Apple, or Google.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications](https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Very useful app for telling me if there are covid positive reports.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 18:06:19__

> This is an excellent tool. I think they could do a better job informing people on how they get the code to start the notification part though. For those interested, the health department can generate the code for you when you receive a call from a contact tracer. You cannot just trigger it based on a positive test result. Please answer the phone when they call after you have been tested or call them back.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:28:48__

> It's helpful<br> :date: __2020-12-07 07:54:07__

> I would like the app to have some way to tell me that I have exchanged tokens with someone, maybe giving me a total for a day. No details, just some indication that the app is doing its job.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 08:25:57__

> It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:19:46__

> Interesting stuff<br> :date: __2020-11-03 04:21:26__

> Great concept but kills my battery. I do have an old phone though so that may be the issue.<br> :date: __2020-10-27 15:53:56__

> I had trouble getting the notifications to work like a lot of people had posted, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked the next time. Not sure what causes this. Glad we have some form of contact tracing!<br> :date: __2020-10-26 03:29:29__

> The title makes it sounds like a carbon monoxide detector -why no mention of COVID-19 or "infectious disease"?<br> :date: __2020-10-26 02:43:35__

> This app doesn't have location access. I just checked the permissions after installing it.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 23:43:32__

> Like<br> :date: __2020-12-12 07:54:21__

> I guess a good app but nobody in my area seems to be using it or posting a positive result in Pueblo County or other counties that I travel to for my job delivering parts, go far as Lamar, west to the San Luis Valley and South to Walsenburg, Trinidad and into New Mexico and you're telling me that I have not been near someone with a positive test result????<br> :date: __2020-12-11 20:39:25__

> Haven't been able to get much info<br> :date: __2020-12-06 18:50:05__

> Called county health department to ask about notification & special code issue. RESULTS: 1) testing agency reports positive tests to the State 2) State notifies counties in which the positive people live 3) w/in 24 hrs, counties notify people who tested positive 4)w/in 48 hrs (cases are mounting),Contact Tracers call infected people & ask w/whom they have been in contact. NO REASON for infected people to need code. Call Labor Dept if there's a work issue. RECOMMEND: call people who know things.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:45:59__

> People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:15:54__

> I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 03:31:37__

> I was in the same house with a person who tested positive... 3 days later... Still no notification! Uninstalling!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 18:55:04__

> Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:54:36__

> Positive test here but can't share my result because I don't have a verification code. failed app so far🤷‍♂️ I've searched for about 15min and can only figure it's because my test was conducted out of state. However, I was around people in CO and would like to share it. Will people share if it's not easily available? I would also recommend information about privacy and how your results a reported. People might have a sense of shame or guilt but might share if there's some sense of anonymity.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 01:48:11__

> Won't let me allow to send notifications<br> :date: __2020-11-06 19:43:06__

> I don't think this app works<br> :date: __2020-11-28 16:58:50__

> I have to provide a "verification code" for my test result. I did not get one though, over the "negative" phone call..<br> :date: __2020-11-24 22:58:35__

> This app is too difficult to use for such a life threatening issue. It needs to be more intuitive before the public will actually begin using this app. It is should be easy to use by those who are not comfortable with technology, yet I am very comfortable with technology and the app took a while to figure out Please do something to make this better<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:56:58__

> major power consumption issues. had to uninstall it because I couldn't use my phone normally without having to charge in the middle of the day, and I only really text on an average day. also noticed my phone was running very hot constantly when I had the app installed. this is something we definitely need, but please optimize it so it doesn't make my phone unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:11:35__

> There is nothing wrong with the app persay, its just i have been using it and i have been doing alot of christmas shopping, and i got not 1 alert. You know how many people out there that have tested positive and havent reported!! So this app isnt going to work!<br> :date: __2020-11-09 17:38:51__

> When I try to turn on notifications, I get an error saying "something went wrong". It will not enable.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 21:26:50__

> My problem is I work in a facility where alot if employees had C19 and I have never been notified....HMMM<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:22:31__

> Seems like this could be a really good app. BUT.....where does someone get the verification code needed to enter a covid 19 result?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 16:27:15__

> Maybe I'm not understanding something but when I try to share my results, It says it will send me a one time verification code, but nothing happens.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 18:31:26__

> Needs gps and bluetooth to be active. Drains battery. Why do we need gps active.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 17:51:00__

> Does not account for the tremendous percentage of people who have absolutely had COVID19, but have not seen a doctor, making it ultimately pointless.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:26:32__

> Won't turn on in the app. Keeps saying something wrong. Now won't let me even try to install it.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 13:56:13__

> No one participates<br> :date: __2020-12-09 02:29:57__

> I tested positive for covid and had no idea how to get the code to report my positive test. I seen its supposed to come from a contract tracer however they were so backed up they announced they're unable to contact everyone that is positive. So I never got contacted, and never got the verification code or link. This app was pointless. I don't trust the accuracy knowing how many people probably had the same experience as me.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 17:54:27__

> This virus is a joke<br> :date: __2020-12-07 10:58:46__

> Where do you get identification code??? NO HELP<br> :date: __2020-12-05 20:44:43__

> Turning on notifications gives an error.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 00:05:45__

> I discovered the magic link was being texted to my home phone number! Mine is through Google Voice so I get an email copy. That email goes to a seldom used gmail address and the link won't open on anything but my mobile phone but clicking on the link bypasses the need for a code. Still one star. There's no documentation, it's pretty stupid to text a home phone especially when you have an email address and you shouldn't have to have an engineering degree to figure out reporting.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 19:35:08__
