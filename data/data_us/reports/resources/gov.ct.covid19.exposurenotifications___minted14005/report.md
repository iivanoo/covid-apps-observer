### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut, supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT-DPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health departments.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State DPH or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CT-DPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CT-DPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CT-DPH to know where or who you are, for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google / Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CT-DPH.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CT Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | [http://ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct) |
| **Email** | DPH.covidalertct@ct.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [State of Connecticut Department of Public Health 410 Capital Avenue Hartford, CT,  06103](https://www.google.com/maps/search/State%20of%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health%20410%20Capital%20Avenue%20Hartford,%20CT,%2006103) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

> Great<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:08:31__

> I live in Taunton, MA & don't travel much. Is it OK to use this until Massachusetts releases one if at all? If it's useless unless I am in or near CT please let me know and I'll uninstall it.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 21:36:27__

> I just downloaded the app I hope I like it and it helps to keep us safe or lets us know how to better besides disinfectant spray<br> :date: __2020-12-01 06:06:29__

> Great<br> :date: __2020-11-30 14:02:08__

> All citizens must be alert about covid-19.Most of the citizens are not wearing Masks, not maintaining social distance. Due to these reasons Covid-19 is not reducing among people. This app is very useful to control covid-19 ,because it alerts the peron who d uses this app-- Ramana VTV.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 04:49:12__

> Nice app, like others have said i appreciate that it doesnt require permissions and the privacy model is transparent. Only thing that could make it better is if it was open source.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 01:57:29__

> Great app. Glad to see CT dept of health participating in this notification system. Be a patriot and wear a mask. It will save lives and prevent the need for further lock downs. No permissions needed. You have no excuse unless you hate your country.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 00:24:33__

> This app is a hoax 😉 Update: I forgot that I wrote the above "review" until I got a response from the developer. I just want to say thank you for everything you are doing. This app is a great idea. Keep up the good work! I probably should have kept my original tongue in cheek "review" to myself.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 05:22:57__

> This is a must have for all apps<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:07:13__

> After deep diving the privacy claims of this app, I feel given it's a fully voluntary system that if you're concerned about covid-19 infection/spread, this app is a useful tool to protect yourself/loved ones while also contributing to the greater good by stopping the spread. Unlike other w reviews, I have had no noticable battery issues B-LE feature on my Note 9. Lost 1 star for some UX bugs I'm sure will be resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 01:47:48__

> Impressive. I am impressed at the effort expended by the State of CT to ensure the safety of its residents, creating an app to track and notify exposure to the threat of a virus that kills approximately 1% of the population (not counting the elderly and those co-morbid), and at the same time continue with the virus-turned-political-weapon that is the COVID19/WUHAN virus. I recall an era when individuals whom presented a threat to the health of others were the ones quarantined. Ugh.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:16:10__

> I hope this updates with past exposures/past positive testers too since I just installed it & it's only providing new reports, of which it's currently empty. Also hope the Samsung Secure Folder installation glitch will be fixed soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 20:25:25__

> Bluetooth and location are always on. Significant battery drain. When a covid notification pops up, it does not take you to view that information. Rather you have to download the active app or you just get a spinning wheel.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 02:19:50__

> Easy to install, but I can't put a shortcut on my home screen. I have to search for it every time I want to open it. Everyone be safe.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 04:38:11__

> As long as it helps people and can't identify me I'm cool with it. I<br> :date: __2020-11-17 05:52:00__

> Great app. I was reading Wormwood a book about apocalypse in Connecticut and the app reminded me of the one the main character has in that book. Its also nice to know when its better to just stay home.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:54:15__

> Just DL'd it so i don't know how well it works but WHAT AN AMAZING idea and UTILIZATION of technology! And it's ANONYMOUS!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:01:39__

> Do your part, wear your mask, keep your distance and install the app<br> :date: __2020-11-13 05:39:02__

> I had no problems downloading this app on my Android phone. The more people who download this app will make this more effective. Will ask friends and family to download as well.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 23:18:58__

> I'm glad the State is doing this, but being near someone's app isn't enough. Not everyone has the app. Why aren't we informed of cases in our town? No personal information needed. I know someone who is positive, and that would be good to know how many, if any cases are in my town w/o having to go to DPH.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:36:41__

> Can't turn on the exposure notice. Keeps saying something went wrong even Uninstaller it and that didn't work. It stopped doing that thing<br> :date: __2020-11-25 22:32:03__

> Idk I live in milford<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:49:59__

> You have to keep your location and Bluetooth on for it to work. That eats up battery. Otherwise it's functional. 🤷🏽‍♀️<br> :date: __2020-11-13 13:14:31__

> Contact tracing is a joke..... My kids have had covid for over a week and a half now, no one has called... I've had it for a week now and no one has called. And u can't report it to the app without be contacted, so someone infected is going around infecting other and not knowing it. Great job CT!<br> :date: __2020-11-30 19:55:48__

> Don't bother installing this app or anything WuFlu related because COVID-19 (i.e. WuFlu, Chinavirus) is a hoax, it DOES NOT EXIST. Trump 2020 Keep America Great And Safe!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 01:35:20__

> This app is worthless! Unless you input positive it will not alert you. There is no way I drive through Waterbury and not 1 alert!!!! What a scam.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:21:24__

> This app dont work at all..i downloud but no said anything at all.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 14:21:06__
