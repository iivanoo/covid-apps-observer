## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Intuitive, well designed, and provides the services I would need from an app like this. The only improvement would be online/ mobile payment.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 21:57:46__

> The video chat option is great for last minute visits for non-urgent medical issues. One Medical has been my provider for nearly a decade and I've been very happy with my medical needs, both preventative and reactive.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 19:18:24__

> Love love love booking my own appointments<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:09:46__

#### 4-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="4_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.onemedical.android 4 reviews"/>
</p>

> Works pretty darn good to be honest, didn't know for a while but you can video chat with someone on demand, it took me about 10 minutes from tapping the thing to speaking with a clinician, neat! Also crucial was the fact that I told this guy that I had sent a message to the med team, and he was able to pull it up and see it. Well integrated and actually easy to use, which is insane for a medical app<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:23:25__

> Great medical service, pretty good app I'm a huge fan of one medical service, the app mostly upholds their high standards. At times I get notifications that I can't seem to clear, And it's difficult to manage my child's account, who's also a one medical patient on the same app. All told though, I'm pretty happy with the way the app makes finding remote care easy<br> :date: __2020-07-28 14:58:50__

> How do I create a second account or change my present one such that I can get separate messages for myself and a dependent customer on the app? I am the medical POA for the 2nd customer.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:14:24__

> The features all work well but the UX could be improved so that it's easier to figure out "what do I want to do" and then follow a clear path to receiving care from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:46:17__

> Stuck at 66% download. Not sure why. Help!<br> :date: __2020-07-02 04:59:16__

> Would be nice to be able to describe symptoms in my own words, rather than choosing from a list. Other than that, good app. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-02-28 20:49:59__

> Great app, very helpful option for video visits. I was traveling and needed a prescription and they got it to a local pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-02-04 16:23:53__

> I enjoy the (mostly) user friendly design. Medical team responds quickly to questions and requests. I'm disappointed that the app does not correctly sort medical centers by distance from me. I've enabled location tracking, but it still defaults to downtown San Francisco as my location , so I have to scroll down dozens of entries to find the locations that are actually near me.<br> :date: __2020-01-15 00:16:56__

> *Updating my review. The app team contacted me and after much back and forth got it working. The app now functions as promised.* I can't get the app to login. I can login to the website but I just keep getting a generic "something went wrong" error when trying to use the same credentials. There is no app support to contact to try and resolve this.<br> :date: __2019-11-05 11:59:47__

> This is not a mature app, but the idea is sound. I like booking appointments at any hour of the day and love the video visit feature. But, when something goes wrong, I want to know more than a generic "Uh oh! Something went wrong. Try again later." If an office was closed due to flooding, the booking error shouldn't tell me to try again. If I can't start a video visit because I have 3% battery, whatever weirdness that generates, "Uh oh[...]try again later" distracts from the real problem.<br> :date: __2019-10-17 10:36:08__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="3_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.onemedical.android 3 reviews"/>
</p>

> Doesn't list the provider and clinic I want to go to...pretty frustrating<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:37:08__

> It would be best if the app remembers the last office I went to and keeps that available on My 1med app . Also be on each page maybe. I only use the app on my android. When I see a dot by messages it should dissappear after I have looked at it. Under care plan, there needs to be an option for "other" to leave specific information. I would say....I tried to go to appointment but got lost, or it was too far, or they don't take my insurance. Love the Chat!!!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:55:21__

> Please update home screen icon to adaptive icons to fit in with android 11.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 06:40:12__

> Almost perfect. It works very well. The best of my medical apps. But unread and unread messages look almost exactly the same. The title can be bold, not bold, or grey. Hard to differentiate, even with the screen magnified.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:59:36__

> Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:30:43__

> They removed the bluetooth connection and it no longer connects to blood pressure cuffs. They did this during the last software update. This was a good capability as you didn't have to manually input blood pressure readings. One Medical I.T. should consider restoring this capability.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 23:04:12__

> Could be better in navigation and the resources it offers. I would have preferred if it looked like the desktop site<br> :date: __2020-06-07 10:59:54__

> The treat me now video call feature currently is broken for me (Google Pixel). I get an error "Uh oh looks like something went wrong" when after I request a video visit.<br> :date: __2019-10-07 06:48:13__

> Cannot take a picture of my insurance card. Camera button does not work. Using a Samsung Galaxy S10. It's been months since I last tried, but this issue has not been solved.<br> :date: __2019-09-27 13:20:01__

> The camera won't focus in the app when I try to upload pictures of my insurance card. My camera is not faulty.<br> :date: __2019-09-02 23:25:52__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.onemedical.android 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> I had a covid test a week ago and still no results. And I can't get anyone to answer what is going on. The lack of information is frustrating and makes me question my membership.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 21:54:01__

> A ton of things fall through the cracks causing an immense amount of confusion with your healthcare that's the last thing you want to not have a quality application especially since this company leans heavily on the application alone outside of in person or Zoom meetings<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:08:33__

> It doesn't work , $199<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:39:50__

> It was reasonable until yesterday. Then, it forgot my password and later felt back to using a webpage. It completely changed the layout and I cannot enter information anymore the way I was used to.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 07:22:24__

> This app is pretty much trash on Android. The ability to take a clear photo of your insurance card is not possible. I have a Samsung S10. Push notifications are inconsistent. Thank goodness I get email reminders. The questionnaire is not adaptive. Respond with "None of the above" and the following prompt asks you for more details 🙄. This app has a ways to go before it's useful for more than simply booking an appointment.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 18:56:35__

> Will not load into Ipod on my phone can not delete all the messages recieved its fill my phone. Many issues too be addressed<br> :date: __2020-08-04 01:55:53__

> When an app with more than a few reviews rates higher than 4.8, something other than "app nirvana" may explain. With One Medical, it's a culture of zero tolerance for dissent or constructive criticism. Were it not for this Orwellian imposition of conformity (yes they will retaliate), both One Medical and its app might deserve 4 stars. The app (like the entity) occasionally has glitches (like the 3-year time warp). Putting all that and privacy violations aside (should we?), it can be OK.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 00:58:11__

> Used to work. Latest upgrade on 4/23 I can not log in via app. App is currently, useless.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 16:35:17__

> The app is not great. It's basically the website with no difference. Like it literally has a tab in menu which says 'Open in app' 😑. There is no way to reschedule or even look at your appointments.<br> :date: __2020-01-09 18:13:55__

> No face id support<br> :date: __2019-12-28 20:08:49__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.onemedical.android 1 reviews"/>
</p>

> Unable to make a Covid-19 vaccination appointment.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 00:58:43__

> Great unless you move outside an office area. Then extremely unhelpful. Their customer service staff also play games on phone calls. Will not sign up again for the same service I can get elsewhere without paying $200 extra.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 20:51:23__

> Trash bag of an app that gets stuck on a perpetual reload screen when you sign in. Oh and it signs you out by itself. Pretty sure this app gave my phone the electronic version of covid.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 20:44:22__

> So far not good the app is slow and cumbersome....seems to do something weird to my camera<br> :date: __2020-12-08 22:06:48__

> New users: Be very careful! One Medical did not indicate that my appointment would not be covered by my insurance nor was any amount ever presented to me beforehand. For a service that is digital and online, that is outright dishonesty, which is tantamount to scamming your customers. Shame on you, One Medical!<br> :date: __2020-09-17 19:54:27__

> Won't load<br> :date: __2020-08-16 09:30:37__

> Forces you to use the app to book covid test. But locations don't match the website.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 19:09:52__

> Useless app. Useless staff. This app lets any doctor, PA or NP in the system contact you after you've had an initial appointment. They don't care as you get passed around getting messages from more and more inept people. They misplace things, forget things and ultimately waste your time with repetitive messages saying they're working on it. They're not. The interface is clunky. App appointments slots (compared to phone bookings) are not accurate. This app wastes time and money.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 23:26:31__

> Google Play Store shows this app as INSTALLED on my A20 Galaxy Android phone, yet it is NOT installed.?????!!!!<br> :date: __2020-07-06 16:30:02__

> Taking a picture of my insurance card is impossible because the quality of the in app photo is illegible. I am on an s10+ with great camera quality so i dont understand why its awful in your app<br> :date: __2020-06-24 14:27:03__
