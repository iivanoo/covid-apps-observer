<br>Online doctors are available 24/7 for minor symptoms like sore throats and stuffy noses.

<br>All of our telemedicine doctors are U.S. board certified.
<br>Therapy services
<br>See a doctoral-level psychologist or a master’s-level therapist by appointment.
<br>Therapists include clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and professional counselors.
<br>All are trained in prevention and treatment techniques specific to telemedicine.
<br>Psychiatry services
<br>Our psychiatrists are online doctors who are also U.S. board certified.
<br>They’re available by appointment and are capable of treating a variety of behavioral health conditions.
<br>They can prescribe medications and work with you to manage them, too, if you need it.
<br>For members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network, the convenience of online health care is at your fingertips.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy and convenient<br> :date: __2021-01-19 18:36:59__

> Don't understand why BCBSofM couldn't verify my insurance. I pay way to high a premium for that. That's very iritating. However, other than that this was a positive experience.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 17:55:21__

> Doctor Good, App Mediocre. Doctor Boehr was quick to evaluate and get me the help I needed. The BCBSM online app, however, failed to connect to my BCBSM insurance information. It also failed five times to verify and accept any credit card information.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 01:34:44__

> Doctor says picture quality wasn't great. She was able to assist me but why is my video quality poor with a Note 10 plus? No other issues.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 16:55:37__

> The app keeps telling me its unable to verify my insurance and asking me to pay<br> :date: __2020-05-17 20:55:40__

> I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but it can never verify my insurance so I have to manually submit.<br> :date: __2020-03-15 18:46:42__

> Online Services include the website.<br> :date: __2019-11-17 01:27:24__

> edit 7/31/19 The counselors on this app have been amazing! Billing dept, no. Continuously miss bill me and I have to get it refunded which takes the rest of the month. They overdrew my account once doing this. Not worth the hassle. Can't afford all that every month. I've been having really bad problems with anxiety and this was the best option for me. I was so happy when I found I could go this route rather than the exhaustion of trying to get to the doctor<br> :date: __2019-08-01 01:15:31__

> Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting. You'll have to re-log back in again although the info. you previously entered will still be there to copy over.<br> :date: __2019-05-21 15:26:34__

> I'm sure that this option for healthcare will be awesome but it did not list my Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance and I am unable to cover the cost so I will have to look for services elsewhere thank you for the opportunity<br> :date: __2020-01-28 02:35:41__

> Doctor couldn't hear me and there is no way to adjust volume in the app.<br> :date: __2019-04-19 06:42:33__

> I was prescribed a very expensive Rx that was not covered by insurance. When I tried to follow up I was told to see an in-person Dr. Waste of money<br> :date: __2018-03-16 20:02:31__

> Psychiatrist can only "do" medication management. How can anyone "do" med management without your records or psychiatric work up. If you just want a bunch of Xanax, this is the place. If you need a help or are trying to determine what you should do for a loved one, this is not the place. Shame on you bcbs.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 00:50:12__

> Doctor experience is a 5 however the tech support and billing department is awful. I will never use this app again.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 01:49:38__

> Had no video, even after several attemps.<br> :date: __2020-09-06 23:08:31__

> Took a while to connect with the doctor. The appointment was really rushed and I was prescribed a medicine that didn't make sense. I called customer support to try to get info on why I was prescribed the certain medicine and was told I had to "take it or leave it or call a different doctor". Tried calling a different physician and the physician declined my call. I would rather go to ready care.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 21:36:58__

> This tool has failed me twice now, trying again tomorrow. Your tech support said my end was fine, it on yours. It is not conducive to ones mental health to experience these failures when trying to get better. I could lose my job if I don't get to speak to a doctor soon.<br> :date: __2020-06-17 13:37:42__

> If I ever wanted my medical information shared with marketers, advertising networks and "services that can provide me options" I'd just post it on Facebook because that's easier and just about as secure.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:25:44__

> This app sucks makes pay money for visit takes 1hr to sit an wait for visit l...doctor koo she prescribes meds easy quick visit..try to get meds from pharmacy they say doc never submitted they give u number to call to resubmit u have to wait another 2 hrs for them to answer I am on hold now<br> :date: __2020-05-19 00:35:48__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. This whole company sucks.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 17:43:14__

> this app doesn't do anything<br> :date: __2020-04-05 23:55:36__

> I sat waiting for an hour for a doctor and then said doc was offline. Tried again and waited an hour and doc went offline. Both times with 2 people ahead of me. I work for bcbsm and this is wrong for me. Our members shouldnt have to deal with this. I shouldnt have to deal with that. Went to urgent care.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 21:41:46__
