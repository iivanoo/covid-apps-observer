### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State’s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

> PRAYERS BLESSINGS ALWAYS FOREVER THANKS<br> :date: __2021-02-15 09:17:50__

> I just let this app run it hasn't gone off yet so I guess that's a good thing. I hope more people install it so they have more data to work with and identify clusters and superspreader events with higher resolution.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 07:25:58__

> Edit: I was told by someone I work with that they tested positive, however this app is not showing that info. That's concerning. I'm hoping more and more people download this app. I live in a small community so I'm not sure if I'm ever going to get a notification stating someone tested positive because I don't think many people know about this app. But there are a lot of positives reported to the news by our County Public Health Dept.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 21:18:36__

> Incredibly beneficial<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:46:05__

> Download this app to be notified for possible exposure to Covid. You have to keep Blutooth on at all times for this app to work properly. Not battery intensive though.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 02:35:03__

> Very useful, now I can stay home and be safe.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 10:20:01__

> Please remember that for this app to work everyone who tested positive has to participate. They can't just add peoples information if they don't agree to it. People need to give permission. So if they don't show up it's bc they aren't doing their job to warn people and the community. What else can you expect from an individualistic western culture.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 00:41:59__

> We have several cases of Covid around the corner and the app does not show them. Very disappointed! I hoped this app would help keep my family safe. The app is working. They must have fixed the bugs!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 04:13:22__

> Simple, easy, negligible effect on battery, and unobtrusive. That's great. The biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't indicate that it's even working in any way. I'd suggest that it at least note the number of other devices that it encountered on a daily basis, so a user would 1. be able to gauge how many actual potential exposures they've had and 2. see that the app is actually doing something. e.g. 'You saw 7 other phones today with the CA Notify app...no exposures reported."<br> :date: __2021-02-09 08:19:14__

> Need asisstance<br> :date: __2021-02-07 07:10:03__

> Yes body ache little headache tired but made it though thank God<br> :date: __2021-01-27 17:36:33__

> At least we've gotten around to using technology in the fight against the Virus.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 04:21:46__

> I'm sure it works for the people that don't mind being followed and tracked but I'm not one of those I know how important the viruses but people know enough about my whereabouts and everything else already as it is I'm home enough then I don't need to worry so much and I don't want my Bluetooth turned on all the time so I got rid of this app if I was out in public a lot I would still have it<br> :date: __2021-01-19 07:30:18__

> Intuitive and easy but I don't think enough users to be effective. I'm an ER doc in CA and have had on my phone with bluetooth on fo weeks and haven't gotten a single alert despite knowing for certain that I've been exposed. A lot.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 05:46:47__

> Very helpful 🙂<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:27:24__

> I am happy this app is made now. I have seen many other states have this for a while Anyway I hope this app improving updates with a little more specific information about the exposure. For instance, how far are we from the person who is covid-19 positive? How long ago were we exposed to that person? Also the positive covid-19 is still a little murky because does it mean the person is sick or just asymptomatic carrier? And some more specific information to gauge the severity.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 07:26:19__

> Would be nice to keep track of all negative results as well.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 04:36:15__

> It wold be great to have an optionfor people to report when they get 1st and 2nd vaccination mapped by location. It would be wonderful positive reinforcement and an aid to the most vulnerable.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 07:54:03__

> Good Idea needs more people to subscribe<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:35:31__

> This is an honor system app. People who get sick are supposed to self report but this won't work because people are dbags.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 18:39:12__

> I think its great concept but truthfully I haven't had time to use the app. but if it does what it says, it's a 5 star app, and if it saves just 1 life. well how many stars can you put on a humen life. More then the stars in the sky.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 08:12:49__

> If you dont have a data plan for wifi while not at home i dont think this works and there is no contact us or email to ask anyone . false sense of security and not protecting you or anyone else if you dont have data/roaming wifi.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 06:07:45__

> Did not notified me when I was in contact<br> :date: __2021-02-21 06:15:41__

> The app is a great idea, however, no one uses it. I spent a couple weeks in a covid unit and I normally work on an ambulance and have never had an exposure alert.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 15:57:11__

> I have not seen so much as a blip with this app. Probably because people don't want to be treated like they have Ebola. It was a good idea to use available tech to try to solve a problem, but the execution relies on people's honesty. Like the Joker said, "When the chips are down...."<br> :date: __2021-02-10 23:38:12__

> Two households for which I brought over groceries and other necessities have multiple people who have tested positive in their house and who I was within 10' of since they tested positive. I have yet to receive a notification of exposure over 30 days since exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 20:19:53__

> Upd: no help. No word. Did I expect better for installing this and proviso to contribute? surprisingly i did. 2stars remain. Giving this a 2 for intent, my Android version doesn't work. My roomie's version on iPhone works fine. Is there a setting that I can check? Please help app developers.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 21:02:39__

> this will work great if every single family get this app. now, 4 families got infected around my house and the app did not hit any allert<br> :date: __2021-01-18 20:28:51__

> App doesn't do much. I think it works off blue tooth and if the other person has their Bluetooth on. I know for certain I've been danger close to numerous people that tested positive with covid-19, but app doesn't recognize that. I assume they need to report it to the app as well . It's a good idea, but requires too many variables to line up.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 10:21:31__

> There has not been any impact. I cannot tell its working. I do not like that you have to have location on all the time. Kills the batt. It sais you dont need location in. Phones have a tracker inside for 911 for your location however there are too much privacy concerns being able to track you all the time. China does and a commy country. I would not be surprised if it does come with the biden admin since that side wants to hold you down.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 02:52:23__

> It only works if infected people input their status. Gov't, testing sites need to take this site over to protect us all<br> :date: __2021-01-10 19:11:06__

> Never worked<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:25:40__

> Does this app work? It does not seem to be doing anything after having used it for over a month. It does not show any feedback or confirmation if it is effective or even working. Another problem is the California government has never aggressively promoted this app, which needs widespread adoption to be effective. Without any apparent benefit, what this app only does is constantly consuming power and tracking my every movement, which is why I am uninstalling it after writing this review.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:06:20__

> NEED manual location update button OR ability to temporarily change time between checkins for this to be effective and reduce false sense of security. DOES NOT check frequently enough. Users may go many places in between app updating our location, therefore MISSING DATA for all those locations and people. We NEED an update so app can know ALL places we have been. Otherwise WE MAY NEVER KNOW we were exposed to Covid by someone using the app because the app didn't realize we were near them! What good is this app if it only recognizes very few places someone with Covid has been instead of all of them? NOT HELPFUL!!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:01:38__

> Useless and not helpful. More Spyware<br> :date: __2021-02-18 10:51:44__

> I have been in contact with someone who has had covid.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 01:58:45__

> Doesn't work my friends tested Positive never got notified. They also have the app and put in that they had tested positive.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 15:51:56__

> Creepy and invasion of privacy<br> :date: __2021-02-12 07:10:24__

> Completely bogus. It was a great idea but nobody is actively managing the server side of this app. So its ultimately doing more harm than good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 05:25:41__

> I tried to report my positive test result but couldn't get a code from them because they didn't have the record in their system. Not the fastest method for reporting something that spreads much faster<br> :date: __2021-02-08 01:04:45__
