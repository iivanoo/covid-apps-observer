## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Couldn't reload app to get time and day to reload.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:27:23__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> Requires having Bluetooth on at all times which drains my battery. It also keeps giving me drop down notifications even though I disabled notifications. I have an android.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 17:34:36__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

> the only reason im downloading this is because it wont let me download some other games<br> :date: __2020-10-02 23:20:13__

> Won't even get past the 3rd setup page....I hope Nevada did not actually pay somebody to build this. Tried again after update ..still will not set up....3rd update did the trick. set up OK ..upped to 3 stars. We will see.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 11:15:50__

> Drains your battery! I dont like to have my bluetooth on all day. I am in the medical field and am exposed to know's what, so oy would be interesting to see if i am exposed at work. Just wished it didn't drain my battery<br> :date: __2020-08-31 17:45:38__

> This app is such an awesome start. It has never updated exposure on it's own. I have to refresh it every time. I have gone a day with no auto updates like it said it would, so I just refresh at least once a day. I wish it showed how many ids you have encountered or something cause it feels like the app isn't doing anything. It would be nice to know that it has read # nearby users and is now checking that many every refresh. It kinda feels like just an info about covid app, not a tracker.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 19:31:12__

> Downloaded the app about two weeks ago worked fine, I assume the first couple days. Now it will never reload information (it has a little time last updated at the top) it's been stuck at the same time no matter what I do. I like the idea of this but it's basically an app that is a website with tracking permissions. All the clickable stuff in the app just take you to a webpage through your internet app.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 04:27:04__

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible. The idea of this app was good; however, it is only as good as the data that is inputted and shared to others. If there's a breakdown in getting the data into the app and out to everyone else, then it doesn't matter how great your app was stuctured.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:58:00__

> Won't refresh anymore making it useless<br> :date: __2020-10-30 02:53:20__

> Hard to find what i need<br> :date: __2020-10-29 01:58:43__

> Have the latest updates, yet asks me to update further. Click the link to do so > infinite load screen. Much needed app, needs some fixes.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 08:51:36__

> Needs work, won't refresh!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 02:17:18__

> DOES NOT AUTO UPDATE.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 14:37:16__

> I installed this app on 8/30/2020. Location and BlueTooth are on. Exposure notifications are on. I received on Exposure Notification on 8/30/2020 at 12:20pm saying No Exposure Found in the last hour. As of 8/31/2020, 12:01pm I have not received any other exposure notices. Even after one hour in the gym. 1) Why isn't this running/working? and 2)How do I manually check for exposures? 3)How frequently should I get exposures? Using a Samsung Note 8, android. Installation seemed to go just fine. Sending question to help email noted below. I very much would like to see this app be successful!<br> :date: __2020-08-31 21:09:02__

> This doesn't work, the app itself looks/seems/feels like a toy or fake, won't even show in the google play search, I had to find the website first then use the link to get to the app and in my girlfriend phone wont pass from the 3rd page "next" Samsung A20, and in my Samsung gs8 the loading update it's "meh".<br> :date: __2020-08-27 04:14:38__

> I love this idea! But... It only shows that the last check was 15 hours ago. One check is all it has done. What good is that? For those stuck on 3rd page, slide the slider in middle of the page as instructions say.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 16:09:15__
