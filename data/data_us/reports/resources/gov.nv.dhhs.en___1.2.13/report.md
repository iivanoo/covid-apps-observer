## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> It seemed to work fine while I was in Vegas but I flew to Dallas last night and now it says the trace app is off and I can't push the grocery basket any further! The wheels locked up so I guess it's just a Vegas phenomenon? "I'll Be Back!" I'll keep it on my phone till then.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 23:17:41__

> Very slow in signing on. Confusing too.<br> :date: __2020-08-26 18:50:32__

> Love this app<br> :date: __2020-12-07 12:52:21__

> Kind of a pointless app when after your test positive literally no one that contacts you knows the code necessary to self report.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 05:05:47__

> I mean, sure, I suppose it'd work, but let's be real. The chances of anyone between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies actually self-reporting is kind of on the low end. This makes the app basically useless. Something like it in Korea, that'd work fine, since they take contact tracing seriously<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:02:59__

> Couldn't reload app to get time and day to reload.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:27:23__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> Requires having Bluetooth on at all times which drains my battery. It also keeps giving me drop down notifications even though I disabled notifications. I have an android.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 17:34:36__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

> the only reason im downloading this is because it wont let me download some other games<br> :date: __2020-10-02 23:20:13__

> Don't know whether this thing really works or not<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:51:42__

> I feel this is just to make profit when you download this app, i downloaded few weeks back a week later some one closed to me came out positive to the virus and i didn't get the alert i have known people that have use this app but seems noone gets an alert<br> :date: __2020-12-02 06:58:48__

> You state to download the DHHS tracing app but when pne opens the google store, there are dozens of apps listed, none of which say DHHS, so what good is that if I cant be traced?<br> :date: __2020-12-01 21:13:57__

> Good idea poorly executed<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:37:24__

> Downloaded the app about two weeks ago worked fine, I assume the first couple days. Now it will never reload information (it has a little time last updated at the top) it's been stuck at the same time no matter what I do. I like the idea of this but it's basically an app that is a website with tracking permissions. All the clickable stuff in the app just take you to a webpage through your internet app.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 04:27:04__

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible. The idea of this app was good; however, it is only as good as the data that is inputted and shared to others. If there's a breakdown in getting the data into the app and out to everyone else, then it doesn't matter how great your app was stuctured.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:58:00__

> Won't refresh anymore making it useless<br> :date: __2020-10-30 02:53:20__

> Hard to find what i need<br> :date: __2020-10-29 01:58:43__

> Have the latest updates, yet asks me to update further. Click the link to do so > infinite load screen. Much needed app, needs some fixes.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 08:51:36__

> Needs work, won't refresh!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 02:17:18__

> Dosent work. I got covid and woke up dead yesterday. Can't believe I trusted an app to tell me if I was exposed to the flu. App was definitely created by a Biden voting Democrat. 🙁<br> :date: __2020-12-13 01:46:56__

> Opened app after a few weeks of not looking at it. States exposure notification is off and click here. Clicked and it took me to the Google services page... why have the app if there's not going to be any notifications?<br> :date: __2020-12-11 02:23:39__

> Does not work. My roommate and I had this app for months. A few weeks ago I notified the app when I tested positive and put in my confirmation code. My Roommate was Never notified. Neither were any of my coworkers with the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 01:38:44__

> This app relies on someone with covid to actually mark that they have covid... so if an infected person doesn't have the app or they don't want to mark themselves as such, you can still contact the disease. These factors essentially render the app useless.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:17:32__

> It doesn't work. Waste of time. Of course it's useless<br> :date: __2020-12-06 17:05:27__

> App doesn't ask for any permissions and you can't enable them, therefore there is no way this works. What a joke.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 04:05:10__

> Funny, I chose not to get a tracking app on my phone and it keeps trying to auto download<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:45:13__

> I have had this download it for about six weeks and it hasn't shown a single case and I live in an area where I know that there have been dozens of cases during this time period so evidently this application does not work.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 06:50:51__

> App keeps freezing & isn't updating the exposure information.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:09:46__

> Nope! Nope! Nope!<br> :date: __2020-12-04 07:33:36__
