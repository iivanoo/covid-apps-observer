## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HEALTH PLAN OF NEVADA, INC. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Well in all past visits I was having a difficult time getting lic. Physicians. But the last two Visits I was able to get the physician s, at least I believe so.? No way to check. But I especially liked the doctor visit prior to this last one. He was polite, listened to patient, exhumed capability, and good sense. I liked him ALOT. i just cant remember his name. Real Good guy.. Oh I dont like the Medicaid's medications list it's kinda iffy. Done<br> :date: __2020-11-03 03:16:01__

> Only works for NV MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS.LOCAL WALLGREENS FORGET IT .THIS APP SUCKS<br> :date: __2021-02-25 01:09:01__

> Its not available on all devices<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:14:12__

> This app doesn't work for me because when I was with waiting for the doctor the app stop<br> :date: __2019-11-20 03:32:03__

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider! PLUS I don't get money back even though the N C Doc's turn me away within 60 sec of logging on. There is no one monitoring this so no way to complain or request a refund. This is a Waste Of Time and Money!<br> :date: __2019-11-11 02:33:43__

> Dr leslie remedies is very rude<br> :date: __2021-02-26 02:18:56__

> This app is terrible. I didnt used to have problems with it but the last 2 times have been a nightmare. The doctors werent able to connect, 1 had to call me and for the other the app stated that my appointment had finished even though it never connected me to the doctor.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:33:48__

> Worst app that I have ever used. It can't connect properly to my insurance on every visit and their personnel don't seem to actually know how to fix the situation each time that I have tried to use it. Also, the damn thing will suddenly kick you off of the appointment while you're waiting once you give up on getting a free appointment and pay for it. Don't use this unless they fix their massive problems. This thing is a mess!<br> :date: __2020-12-06 17:44:15__

> Didn't cancel appointment I canceled, cannot maneuver to find covid test results, but liked my physician on 3/31<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:55:38__

> Always technical issues. I have the newer smart phone and I pay for the internet. It always kicks me out.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:50:39__
