## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HEALTH PLAN OF NEVADA, INC. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app doesn't work for me because when I was with waiting for the doctor the app stop<br> :date: __2019-11-20 03:32:03__

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider! PLUS I don't get money back even though the N C Doc's turn me away within 60 sec of logging on. There is no one monitoring this so no way to complain or request a refund. This is a Waste Of Time and Money!<br> :date: __2019-11-11 02:33:43__

> Worst app that I have ever used. It can't connect properly to my insurance on every visit and their personnel don't seem to actually know how to fix the situation each time that I have tried to use it. Also, the damn thing will suddenly kick you off of the appointment while you're waiting once you give up on getting a free appointment and pay for it. Don't use this unless they fix their massive problems. This thing is a mess!<br> :date: __2020-12-06 17:44:15__

> Didn't cancel appointment I canceled, cannot maneuver to find covid test results, but liked my physician on 3/31<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:55:38__

> No longer connects well. Since the update it says you are connected, waiting for the physician to connect...then it doesn't connect and the doctor cancels<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:04:15__

> Always technical issues. I have the newer smart phone and I pay for the internet. It always kicks me out.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:50:39__

> I waited for the doctor, the app said "you have connected and are waiting for the doctor to connect". After about a minute, another message that said "The doctor cancelled the call".<br> :date: __2020-07-02 12:39:26__

> Couldn't even connect<br> :date: __2020-07-01 23:41:53__

> Made to use this app because of Corona virus, 200$ for a normal check up? No thanks I'd rather die.<br> :date: __2020-05-18 12:28:23__

> It doesn't open 😠 I've tried and tried and nothing!!<br> :date: __2020-04-12 03:17:30__

> Why, oh why...when I do my initial login, after the app sends me an email verification code, does the app kick me back to the initial login screen when I switch my phone screen to said email to obtain said verification code, thereby invalidating the aforementioned verification code? When I put my credentials back in, I am sent a new verification code. Rinse, lather...repeat... Will I ever be able to login without requiring a secondary device just to check my email???<br> :date: __2020-04-04 03:09:35__

> Tried to call customer service and after 30 minutes listening to the elevator music and please hold on I decided that I want a more responsive experience. They suck!<br> :date: __2020-03-31 01:20:18__
