### Description
> Welcome to the NALCHBP Telehealth Urgent Care. This app allows you to have a face-to- face visit with a qualified medical professional 24/7 on your mobile device with no appointment or referral needed. All providers are licensed and board-certified doctors, including pediatricians, who can diagnose, recommend treatment, prescribe medically necessary medications and provide a sick slip for school or work. Some of the conditions treated include:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cold and flu symptoms
<br>• Sinus congestion
<br>• Fever
<br>• Headaches
<br>• Pinkeye
<br>• Insect Bites
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Cuts and scrapes
<br>• And much more!
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Request a visit - Open the NALCHBP Telehealth app and create an account. Log in and choose an available doctor by reviewing their provider profile. This details their spoken languages, state licensure, board certifications, professional affiliations, clinical interests and education. You will be asked to provide medical history for the patient, indicate what pharmacy you use and pay your $10 copayment for the visit.
<br>Talk to a doctor – Within minutes, the doctor you have chosen reviews your medical history and your virtual visit begins. The doctor will discuss the issue with you, answer your questions and recommend next steps. If a prescription is medically necessary, it will be submitted to a local pharmacy of your choice. The average visit length is 10 minutes.
<br>After the visit – Clinical notes about the visit will be available on your account for sharing with your primary care provider or for your records. Any prescription or sick slip written may also be found there.
<br>Your NALCHBP Telehealth account is also available online at www.nalchbptelehealth.org or by calling 888-541-7706.
<br>Get the urgent care services your family needs, wherever you are, with the NALCHBP Telehealth app.
<br>Your privacy is taken very seriously. An NALCHBP Telehealth visit is secure and HIPAA compliant. This site is intended for NALC Health Benefit Plan High Option members only. Services are separate from your PPO provider network. If you are not an NALCHBP member, you will be responsible for the full cost of any services you receive from our urgent care practice.
<br>Please note that telehealth is not for emergencies. If you’re having a medical emergency, call 911.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
