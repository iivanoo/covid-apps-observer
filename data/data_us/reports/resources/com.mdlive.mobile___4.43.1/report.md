## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It was a good experience except for two things 1. every time you have to go back and change something you have to start answering questions again from the beginning and 2. you cannot just type in a year you have to select it. So if it was several years ago you have to keep hitting the back button.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:12:14__

> Prompt service<br> :date: __2021-01-03 05:39:47__

> Knowledgeable clinician was available quickly and gave thorough information. There was a lag in video/audio which is why I only gave 4 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 22:08:17__

> Easy to use and extremely helpful<br> :date: __2021-01-02 18:10:12__

> Dr. Kaplin was great. He had a good screen side manner. He listened to me and gave me understandable instructions. Thank you Dr. Kaplin!<br> :date: __2021-01-01 09:59:14__

> Dr very pleasant, very knowledgeable, caring, this is a great way to see a physician.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 18:26:10__

> Dr. Was very friendly he was understanding and helpful.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:12:07__

> Audio was pretty clear except when we both started talking. Video was slightly grainy the entire conversation. Help from Dr. Susan Diamond was 5/5<br> :date: __2020-12-17 13:30:12__

> Overall, this is an amazing app and an incredible blessing during a pandemic. Dealing with continued therapy appointments has proved to be a tad difficult. Obviously one would like to keep the same provider but you are unable to schedule another appointment until the next day and unless the provider is currently seeing patients, they don't show up in the list to select. Other than this small issue, this app is worth dealing with!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:31:36__

> This has been super helpful for the pandemic. Do have some issues for the 2 times I used it connecting to the video call. Seems to look like it freezes and the doc is either not joining or something is wrong and no indication of what it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 16:26:53__

> It's my fault for not going to the end of this month for the next few days so I can get the car running a little bit late but I am going to try y<br> :date: __2020-12-25 00:13:06__

> The app glitches a lot<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:14:22__

> Love the ability to have help or a doctor pretty quickly but the video quality is in definite need of attention.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 01:45:06__

> Countless technical difficulties logging in to do a video chat missed four appointments in a row because video chat wouldn't connect.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:58:44__

> The app its self is hit or miss performance. There are often errors especially with video stream consolation. The rest of the app seems to work fine. I missed a total of 4 appts in a row.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 19:39:15__

> Super buggy. Lacks adequate loading signifiers. Lacks profile signifiers when 2 people share the same name. Refreshes spontaneously when trying to create profile. But still a good service. Was able to get my medicine way faster than if I scheduled a live appointment.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 04:32:18__

> The app did not work i had to go through my insurance company to get through something is not good with the app it just keeps kicking me to web page not avilible<br> :date: __2020-11-28 00:29:37__

> Internet connection is the key. I had a counselor before and she uses this platform so I don't have much experience with picking providers. But the video quality, sound, and virtual waiting room were all up to par.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:02:37__

> I have used MD live a few times. I am now having trouble with the app itself. I keep getting unable to load needed service. And application exits.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 16:06:56__

> Didn't get to video chat w/the Dr.& had roughly a 3 minute conversation with the Dr.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 00:23:40__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> The app works, but is frustrating. It continually says I have a message waiting but there is no message to read. I made an appointment, PAID, and then doctor never showed. So now what? I paid and got no service.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:22:16__

> Great experience, would definitely use again. It was convenient and very easy to use. Update: Used again and was extremely disappointed. The doctor never looked and my pictures that I had sent. Also I wanted a video call, instead the doctor called me on the phone, he was driving and like I said he never looked at my pictures because he asked me to describe my rash. Without looking at my pictures he went ahead and diagnosed me even after I told him I already had the prescription he prescribed it<br> :date: __2020-12-01 17:20:58__

> It keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:47:38__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> Auto created account through cigna, username looks like a name and UUID, but login of app doesn't allow more than 30 chars and doesn't accept email (site does). Unable to login via app, so kinda useless there.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 21:11:42__

> I have tried to use this app to separate times to speak with a doctor using a video call and the first time it would not take my credit card information and I never could get that to complete and now this second time I could never get past the screen asking for my blood pressure my heart rate my blood glucose levels and that sort of thing I can get to that point and it would never go any further no matter what I did so I just closed the app logged into the website through Google and everything w<br> :date: __2020-07-23 17:07:26__

> I signed up to see a doctor. I had to wait an hour for my appointment. After my doctor was 15 minutes late, I called customer service. They told me I had to wait another 15 minutes. After that, I got a phone call that said MDLive was unable to carryout my appointment because of technical difficulties. I have used telehealth in the past and never had this problem. To make matters worse, their 1-800 number stopped working. So the only chance I have to contact them is by email. 1 1/2 hours wasted<br> :date: __2020-12-29 14:36:33__
