## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I love this app. It has allowed me and my family access to a physician when my family physician wasn't available and an ED visit would be a waste. I have been beyond satisfied with each consultation being professional, quick, informative and resolving my issue. I recommend it any time it comes up in conversation.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 00:47:15__

> My Mom passed away in July.. my grief was too, too heavy to carry.. I knew I required/needed help from a Counselor.. Not just any Counselor, but one specializing in grief experienced by those suffering the loss of a loved one. The Doctor I have my Online Visits with has more than met my expectations of helping me through the worst kind of pain,.. pain I never knew that could be as bad as it was and still is at times. I'm healing.. thank you God.. and thank you Doctor.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 21:18:27__

> My insurance doesn't even charge a copay to use this service. The doctors are always available and professional. Its so easy to be seen and no reason to delay in consulting one. I can't say enough for this service and the added convenience.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 19:27:44__

> Internet connection is the key. I had a counselor before and she uses this platform so I don't have much experience with picking providers. But the video quality, sound, and virtual waiting room were all up to par.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:02:37__

> I have used MD live a few times. I am now having trouble with the app itself. I keep getting unable to load needed service. And application exits.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 16:06:56__

> Didn't get to video chat w/the Dr.& had roughly a 3 minute conversation with the Dr.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 00:23:40__

> The scheduling and appointment help has been awesome. The major issue I have is that the sound when on the appointments will not go through my Bluetooth headphones. This is the only app that the calls won't go through. Edit: Appreciate passing it along. I isolated the issue; when the app is running,even in the background, no sound from any app will play to any Bluetooth device. Once the app is closed, the Bluetooth audio in other apps works as expected. Please contact me for more specific info<br> :date: __2020-08-21 17:38:12__

> Operates as intended, but doesn't remember specific patient on a specific device, so it would be better to automatically log in as me on my device, and not my partner/the "who needs care" selection screen. Perhaps even separate passwords for family members in case of sensitive topics?<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:24:47__

> There should be a way to rate an leave reviews for providers<br> :date: __2020-07-24 22:00:17__

> It seem that you have to be online to use it. Can't just use the phone connection. But it works and so I give it a 3<br> :date: __2020-07-10 15:01:21__

> The experience with the doctor was great but the app seems to still have some bugs to work out. Slow response, not accepting my answers, asking too many questions up front, confusing procrss to finally get to a doctor.<br> :date: __2020-06-28 07:52:50__

> I joined my appointment early and began a discussion with the physician, who seemed great. Then while the physician was speaking, the video conference dropped unexpectedly. I searched for how I might reconnect but found nothing and there was no mention of my appt in the history. A moment later, I received a call with an option to setup a new appt. Tried that but this time it didn't connect me to appt at all. These appointments work fast better on a laptop/browser.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 16:29:36__

> Mediocre for video; awful for scheduling. You can tell it any date you want to schedule a doctor and it will show you all doctors whether they are available or not.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 22:04:50__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> Auto created account through cigna, username looks like a name and UUID, but login of app doesn't allow more than 30 chars and doesn't accept email (site does). Unable to login via app, so kinda useless there.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 21:11:42__

> I have tried to use this app to separate times to speak with a doctor using a video call and the first time it would not take my credit card information and I never could get that to complete and now this second time I could never get past the screen asking for my blood pressure my heart rate my blood glucose levels and that sort of thing I can get to that point and it would never go any further no matter what I did so I just closed the app logged into the website through Google and everything w<br> :date: __2020-07-23 17:07:26__

> The app is ok. There were always some issues with the the video chat and scheduling. The dr I spoke to basically had no idea what I was talking about. He just got paid for telling me to go to urgent care. Which I finally got a hold of my PCP and she figured it out. There are not enough providers for other services.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 22:23:55__

> Always crashing. After I fill out everything to book the appointment this app crashes. It's been doing this for over a year and I always have to go to the website to make the appointment.<br> :date: __2020-06-12 21:53:18__

> The doctors don't pay attention to the medications you take the time to fill out and will just prescribe the first one that pops up<br> :date: __2020-05-19 05:58:46__

> REVIEWERS!!! What a waist of time!!! Dont pay for this garbage. Real docs take few min to diagnose. Worth 100s?? I can use med md online and tell you whats wrong. No checkup, physical, bloodwork, vitals. The idiocy of people just amazes me. Please do not reproduce. Benifits of app? None. Everyones nice and helpful when you pay them. Unless i have to wait untill the second coming, or its and emergency ( which u should go to e.r) whats the difference from this and a local doc. 10 min drive.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 07:24:02__
