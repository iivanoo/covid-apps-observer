## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quick and easy process once I found my login info! Doctor was knowledgeable and easy to talk to and very helpful. The virtual visit was only $45 too, which was great. I'm on a high deductible plan so I would have had to pay at least $150 to go to urgent care. Great deal. Will definitely use again, if necessary (hopefully not!).<br> :date: __2021-02-06 16:48:01__

> The app is user friendly and the service I received from the doctor was great.. I had a quick and thorough consultation via video, described my symptoms and had a prescription called into the nearest pharmacy.

> Main issue is accidentally skipping appointments by just a few seconds puts you back in line. However the ability to jump right back in is easy and the low cost really helps motivate me to get medical advise I'd otherwise need to spend way more money for.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 21:43:14__

> Awesome and helpful<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:15:05__

> Of the 3 times I have used it, only once did I have a slight issue with the audio. But just used it for a 3rd time and audio and video were perfect. Easy to use and usually a doctor comes on within minutes.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 12:26:11__

> I love the providers on the app. The app mostly works well with little problem.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 04:30:12__

> I will honestly say this app has saved me plenty of times. I get to meet at my time and still get help. I really recommend it, it can sometimes be xonfusing to find info on the app though which is why i give it 4 stars. However i have gotten reqlly quality care<br> :date: __2021-01-18 22:59:43__

> The app glitches a lot<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:14:22__

> Love the ability to have help or a doctor pretty quickly but the video quality is in definite need of attention.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 01:45:06__

> Countless technical difficulties logging in to do a video chat missed four appointments in a row because video chat wouldn't connect.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:58:44__

> The app its self is hit or miss performance. There are often errors especially with video stream consolation. The rest of the app seems to work fine. I missed a total of 4 appts in a row.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 19:39:15__

> Super buggy. Lacks adequate loading signifiers. Lacks profile signifiers when 2 people share the same name. Refreshes spontaneously when trying to create profile. But still a good service. Was able to get my medicine way faster than if I scheduled a live appointment.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 04:32:18__

> The app did not work i had to go through my insurance company to get through something is not good with the app it just keeps kicking me to web page not avilible<br> :date: __2020-11-28 00:29:37__

> Internet connection is the key. I had a counselor before and she uses this platform so I don't have much experience with picking providers. But the video quality, sound, and virtual waiting room were all up to par.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:02:37__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> The app works, but is frustrating. It continually says I have a message waiting but there is no message to read. I made an appointment, PAID, and then doctor never showed. So now what? I paid and got no service.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:22:16__

> Great experience, would definitely use again. It was convenient and very easy to use. Update: Used again and was extremely disappointed. The doctor never looked and my pictures that I had sent. Also I wanted a video call, instead the doctor called me on the phone, he was driving and like I said he never looked at my pictures because he asked me to describe my rash. Without looking at my pictures he went ahead and diagnosed me even after I told him I already had the prescription he prescribed it<br> :date: __2020-12-01 17:20:58__

> It keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-01 13:47:38__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

> Auto created account through cigna, username looks like a name and UUID, but login of app doesn't allow more than 30 chars and doesn't accept email (site does). Unable to login via app, so kinda useless there.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 21:11:42__

> Trash. Set up appointments, say I'll get a call, never do, then the app says i miss my appointment. This app and this service is garbage, customer service can only say up more appointments that then follow the same pattern of being "missed".<br> :date: __2021-01-31 22:42:18__

> Dr could not do anything for me except tell me to see my GP, I was still charged $55 only to be told they couldn't help me. I also have no insurance. Charging me to tell me you can't help me while I'm seeking help, is just wrong!<br> :date: __2021-01-31 20:17:14__

> Worst app experience. Spent 30 minutes filling out the form. Then it tells me payment not accepted. Doesnt give any reason. Was the credit card information incorrect? Does the bank need validation. How about a link to renter the card information. Nothing just go screw yourself because we designed a garbage app<br> :date: __2021-01-26 18:27:06__

> Terrible app. I don't mind paying if you are going to help me but if I wanted a doctor who is only interested in grabbing my money before I can ask a single question, I'd stay with my old quack doctor.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 14:55:57__
