### Description
> Coalition is a global, privacy by design, contact tracing app to stop the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Coalition App alerts you if you have crossed paths or spent time with another user showing symptoms, or those who have tested positive for the virus.
<br>Instead of using your location data, Coalition uses secured bluetooth to protect your privacy.  Your information stays anonymous and private, and isn't shared with anyone without your permission.
<br>Only when you confirm that you are sick, does Coalition share an anonymous ID with others who you have come into contact with.
<br>We believe that citizens can help fight pandemics without giving up their privacy, Coalition is the first step to a pandemic free future.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's a shame more people aren't downloading this app! It's also a problem when I search Google play store for COVID-19 apps and they only show 2 apps that aren't even for my area. I appreciate you and your team for helping with the issue üôè<br> :date: __2020-07-29 18:18:00__

> Good concept and technology behind. Only a minor downside with some phone models draining the battwry but I see they are working to fix the issues.<br> :date: __2020-04-30 06:18:54__

> I like the level of privacy assured and I recommended it on NextDoor. But I have a question. As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron üëç<br> :date: __2020-04-25 02:24:34__

> The app doesn't use Google's Exposure Notifications API, and therefore does nothing. The app is otherwise okay.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 13:36:29__

> Micha Benoliel - Do you go stalking everyone who leaves a negative review about your products? I know you visited my linkedin, so I guess you visited all my other social profiles. Privacy isn't much of a concern to you or your company. I definitly came to the right conclusion about this app. I saw your previous reply before you deleted it. I'm just a user. Your behaviour is disgusting. I'm reporting you to Google.<br> :date: __2020-05-03 01:33:33__
