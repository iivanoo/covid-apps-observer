## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Doctor On Demand, Inc |
| **Website**  | [http://www.doctorondemand.com/contact](http://www.doctorondemand.com/contact) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quick and efficient<br> :date: __2021-04-18 05:52:32__

> Traci was so compassionate and took time with us, made us feel like we were her only priority when my son was ill. I love using Dr. On Demand and not having to go into a clinic if it's not needed. I've always had a positive experience with the providers. Thank you!<br> :date: __2021-04-18 02:28:10__

> They actually listen to your issues. Resolution was quick and met my needs.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 16:26:51__

> Great alternative to dr. office visit... took 1 star from review because app doesn't go landscape, it would be really good for tablet use<br> :date: __2021-04-08 21:17:07__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 01:47:54__

> It takes a few minutes to get information in but it was easy after that.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 17:55:26__

> Nice friendly doctors. App is easy to use. Doctor I had really explained things to me and made sure I knew what he was talking about.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 02:07:59__

> Very helpful.<br> :date: __2021-04-05 17:43:31__

> So far, so good.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:18:58__

> Works really well, app is intuitive and does what it says it does. Volume was extremely low though, and that was even with speakerphone selected, which didn't seem to make a difference.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 01:34:22__

> Always helpful and gives great service!<br> :date: __2021-03-30 21:30:03__

> Aside from a longer wait time than originally stated on the app (20 minutes versus 5 minutes), I was able to get an appointment after getting off of work on a Sunday, in my bed nonetheless!<br> :date: __2021-03-29 04:34:11__



#### 3-star reviews

</p>

> The providers are amazing, customer service is a joke.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 15:37:48__

> This was my 1st visit, I like how convenient it is. However I cleary have a sinus infection, I have had them plenty of times and know the symptoms. Everything is not always covid. If you get pregnant covid, break a nail covid!<br> :date: __2021-03-12 17:15:54__

> I would've given a better rating it it wasn't for the fact that they added my sister along with my mother as family members suffering from dementia. They didn't provide a way for me to correct the misinformation.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 00:49:51__

> I don't have insurance because I can't afford it and Doctor on Demand is very expensive.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 18:21:55__

> The doctor was fine, but the audio was atrocious. Turns out you have to manually tell the app to switch to headphones from speaker even with wireless or wired headphones active on your device. I didn't figure this out until the end of the call. That is some backwards technology.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 16:05:41__

> Cannot schedule a future appt unless it's today or tomorrow. When scheduling an appt. The app should auto select the previous physician.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 22:04:11__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="2_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.doctorondemand.android.patient 2 reviews"/>
</p>

> Setting up an appointment is easy and the mobile app is straightforward, but my counseling session left me feeling worse than I did before it! My therapist seemed very irritated right from the start. She maintained composure but seemed impatient and distracted throughout the session, which she ended 20 min early, without warning. I feel scammed, at least my insurance is covering it. So much for virtual therapy.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 18:43:22__

> Awesome service, but it has major caveats. If you need individual help for something like a soar throat it's great. But if you have kids, and all three have the same sickness, you have to call in three times, pay three times, and potentially get three different treatments for the same problem. My kids had impetigo, same symptoms - one got one oral antibiotic, the other got a different oral antibiotic, and the third got a topical. This is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 14:49:10__

> Appointments and medical advice are great. Customer service is not. Something as simple as getting a form to a doctor you see can take weeks.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 15:07:39__

> Easy and convenient when it it work's out, the last two appointments were missed, the first because I could not get into the video chat and they put me down as a no show, the other time was today, I was in the app waiting for the appointment to start when I noticed the date was changed to tomorrow when I work, now I have to Waite till next month to see the doctor.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 22:07:09__

> I loved the doctor. Attempting to access my appointment PRIOR was HELL. No where on your app so you explain how the app works. The video you provide "What you can expect on your first visit" was hogwash. It did NOT explain anything at all. Appreciated the care but the app is NOT user friendly.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 17:47:59__

> \*\*\*\* PLEASE PLEASE, try not to use this kind of app unless u really need it. These kind of apps can fail you when you run need. Customers from all over the US are needed services. W/Limited workers u may not get your prescription or referral u need. Research these types of apps. Also If u google doctors help/assistance u'll get a wide variety. Some W/800 #. I've had mix results, but after using different aspects of these services I understand the limitations. I hope this helps you.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 21:53:16__

> Very poor technical platform. First appointment doctor drop the call because coul not hear. Second appointment doctor explained they hear feedback because of platform<br> :date: __2021-03-09 15:17:35__

> Ive used yhis app 3 times. 2 of the times they didnt fulfill the papeework requirement i had to return ti work. Which makes you have to go back a 2nd time. Last time took 5 wks for them to get a pi release for me to give dr and they never contacted him to sign paperwork. lost the job.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 00:50:25__

> The consulting service itself is great, and the doctors have been both helpful and professional, but the app/service restricting the ability to make appointments based on your current location and not the location where you'll have returned to in... I don't know... 5 weeks' time when the appointment ACTUALLY is scheduled is more than a little frustrating. Not only that, booking on a PC isn't allowed without camera access. Except I don't have a camera installed on this PC, and I don't intend to use it for the appointment. App developers, please consider that the devices and locations used during the appointment booking process may not reflect those used at the time of service and be more flexible. Show a warning: "This doctor is not licensed in your current state. Please ensure you have returned to your state of residence at the time of your appointment." or perhaps "Please note that this service will require camera access at the time of your appointment." These restrictions should only apply at the time of service. What's to stop me from booking an appointment in the correct state and on a device with a webcam, only to lack both of those at or near the time of the appointment? THAT'S the issue you need to address. Not the arbitrary one you're creating for your users. Overall, it's a good service with a restricted app and website that don't even necessarily address the issues for which they've made the app/website so restrictive.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:27:12__

> Not useful. No therapists and doesnt accept blue cross? Um. Ok.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 03:47:35__

> I am a technically challenged senior and want to learn how to communicate in solitary confinement amongst a community of fearful russians and Hispanics who are involved in drug deals living nearby. I am in need of medical services and everybody has been using my personal information to steal from me and my family members because there are cyborthieves that got into my account from the dark web. I am in pain and severely technologically hindered by my perfect semi- awareness during this time<br> :date: __2021-04-16 01:16:32__

> Waste of money. Dr will tell you to do a follow up and not percribe any antibiotics. Its all about money.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 20:38:12__

> What a rip off and scam. Just another Mr McGraw ( noticed I didn't say Dr Phil, because he's not really a Doctor) Scam! Stay clear there are some other apps that work well with legitimate Doctors.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 23:03:53__

> Horrible Customer service & Negligent care providers. Do yourself a favor and use another Telemedicine service. I was seeking assistance for 4 days. Not only did it take them days to answer messages. When they did I received the same unhelpful response as I did on the phone. Oh well we sent the request to the doctor . The request? He took me off work and failed to give me a note as promised during the visit. IT WAS HIS IDEA 💡. Oh and he won't be back until April 12th!<br> :date: __2021-04-06 19:36:54__

> Not covered by healthfirst. To those on healthfirst just to let you know they don't take this insurance. Everything is wildly expensive.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 12:23:48__

> I didn't get to find out.. I have government assistance insurance and it doesn't take it. I have a very of mental health issues and needed a doctor and my meds refilled but I can't afford a couple hundred dollars.<br> :date: __2021-04-04 14:24:14__

> My insurance pays 100%..but not here. Would be at least $125 plus extra. Dr. Phil I just quit loving you. Better luck next time I hope.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 02:48:29__
