## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Overall experience was great. Wait was a little long but no volume issue or video lag beside the standard that is expected with these type of videos. Doctor was very professional and helpful with all questions I had.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 18:51:44__

> Very convenient app for healthcare. A couple of glitches, but nothing too bad.<br> :date: __2019-11-11 17:05:08__

> It did save me time from getting up and literally going into an Urgent Care but it's not an actual 24/7 operation like it suggests. I rated it a 4 because of that. I did see a Dr and was given medication for a preexisting illness. So all and all I would definitely use this App again.<br> :date: __2018-09-22 19:27:17__

> BCBS sucks. Tax the rich and socialise healthcare. Wiped out my savings the one year I had to buy health insuarance. Lost 70 lbs and ate dog bones.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 04:14:54__

> App keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-08-20 19:07:13__

> horrible. first rime teying to use it. I was in waiting room for 4 hrs. bluecross ended my session 2x. still disnt get through<br> :date: __2020-04-01 20:25:37__

> The doctor that you're in line to see disappears without warning. Waited 9 hours to see a doctor because they kept leaving so I had to get in line to see a different one.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 15:07:54__

> Disappointed. Could not help because the patient is 17 and all the doctor could do was tell her she has to see her PCP. Then why allow people to add their dependent children? They still charged me the full price.<br> :date: __2020-03-11 04:52:05__

> They need to state that they don't prescribe certain medications even though they are not a controlled substance. I got charged $39 to be told they don't prescribe the medications I was needing. No, they are not controlled substances. I am just without a vehicle and have been without my meds 3 weeks plus having to change doctors due to change from Medicaid to Blue Cross. I guess I don't understand what this App is for? I thought it was the same as going in for a visit with your doctor.<br> :date: __2019-02-22 20:59:07__
