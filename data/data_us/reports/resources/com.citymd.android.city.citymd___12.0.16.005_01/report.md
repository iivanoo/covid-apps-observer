## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | City Practice Group of New York, LLC |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | aftercare@citymd.net |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Wait til some patients try going back to this site & find that their regular email addresses &/or passwords are "not correct", even though you know it is. The site can't hold onto what you may have entered, regardless of whether CityMD gave out the temporary psword or you chose it yourself, you most likely end up having to re register again.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 00:29:37__

> Took Covid19 test<br> :date: __2020-07-06 23:04:39__

> As of July 02, 2020 at 5:30pm, there is a problem with the app. If you create an account thru the web using your computer, or by responding to the "patient portal" e-mail first, the app will not recognize your username or password chosen thru the web. Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__

> Log in fail! I keep entering my username and password and it tells me it's wrong. I know it's not because I can log in through the web patient portal.<br> :date: __2020-07-02 16:01:20__

> Can't log in on the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-29 17:39:33__

> The app doesn't recognize the the patient's portal username and password.<br> :date: __2020-06-16 01:56:10__
