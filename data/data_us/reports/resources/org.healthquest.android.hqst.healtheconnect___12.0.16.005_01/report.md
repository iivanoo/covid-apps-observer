## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app through nuvance is quite good but the quality of talking or viewing through it seems to depend on the system you are using. It worked excellent on my android galaxy S9, but not at all good on my Acer chrome book but moderately ok on my Lenovo all in one desktop. For overall use its been fine and since multiple of my medical providers use it, the choice is use it or phone call with no video.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 19:57:20__

> I am not good with computers or applications using computers. At first i didn't know how to install an application at all, but i did it<br> :date: __2020-11-19 21:23:31__

> Easy.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:05:13__

> Sending an invitation to login 24 hours in advance is silly. When you log in it tells you you're too early.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 18:43:27__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-05-12 18:01:38__

> Video was fine audio is choppy but other than that the app is good!!!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 14:28:05__

> The Doctor was fantastic, but the service is very different than in person. It is Okay, when I have to...<br> :date: __2020-04-30 21:33:03__

> I love how you can see yourself and the provider. At times its hard to just stare at a person on video chat so this give you an opportunity to look at yourself if needed to get rid of the nervous jitters. Only crappy part was the sound we couldn't hear each other at times.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 16:14:21__

> Good. Doctor said my voice was delayed.<br> :date: __2020-04-20 17:45:15__

> Very convenient! Loved it. Aside from a pixelated video and a little delay, it was awesome!<br> :date: __2020-04-09 17:30:25__

> Connection is spotty...not the best when it comes to that<br> :date: __2020-05-29 16:55:14__

> The visit was not as good as when i use othet apps. The doctor kept freezing every other second. The visit completely cut off once and the doctor had to reboot. It seemed as though every time she looked at something else on her computer the visit froze. Very annoying. We both kept having to repeat. The visit therefore probably took longer because of this. Also, i had given my medications to the assistant over the phone. But i spent 20 minutes inputing my medications and was late entering t<br> :date: __2020-05-14 18:09:05__

> I used this for a doctor appointment and the video kept freezing.<br> :date: __2020-05-12 19:38:34__

> Site kept freezing<br> :date: __2020-04-23 22:40:26__

> Helpful for time saving and putting miles on your vehicle, however, it is limited on overall diagnostics and care without seeing your provider in person.<br> :date: __2020-04-03 15:02:47__
