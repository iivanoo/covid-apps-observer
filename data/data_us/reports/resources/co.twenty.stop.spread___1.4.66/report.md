## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is anyone else not able to download the app?<br> :date: __2021-02-04 19:30:05__

> So what do I do if my name is listed wrong and therefore cannot see my results<br> :date: __2021-02-02 21:03:21__

> This app does a great job of collating test results in chronological order, appears to use proper security, and has a useful interface. Test results from NYS reported to FL are listed too. Currently, none of my results from before December 2020 are listed, nor are employed the personal proximity features that were built for Android specifically for the Covid-19 pandemic that kills more Americans per day than died on the terrorist attack on our country on 11 September 2001. Fix for five stars.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 17:11:31__

> The test took 6 days ,I asked for tje test results to be sooner I was told no more then 3 days,so I had a flight to n.y. booked ,I needed the papers cleared of covid which I am negative.but didn't get them on time so the airline said I could not fly with out it..So ticket was none refundable ,so I not only I could not go to n.y. I also lost the 200 dollar ticket I paid for....Again i asked for the results to be sooner and it took 6 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:06:29__

> Udate..issues being adressed..will change my rating once resolved ..Thankyou twenty inc for tesponding.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 02:37:58__

> Easy to set up however, birthdate field fails. I entered correct date, confirmed it is the date on file with me provider, app indicates error, dates don't match.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 18:14:10__

> Good app but for COVID tests the report of the results it gives does not include the resulted date, just the date of the taken same. This resulted test date is determinant for some travel requirements that are time sensitive.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 04:39:13__

> Why doesn't this app use the exposure notifications API in Android?<br> :date: __2021-01-24 01:04:24__

> This app needs to configure merging existing charts. It creates way too many duplicates in the system for employees which creates more work in contacting patients.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 18:31:58__

> What is my result<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:08:46__
