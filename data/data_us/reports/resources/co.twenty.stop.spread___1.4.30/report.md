## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Twenty Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://healthytogether.io/](https://healthytogether.io/) |
| **Email** | support@healthytogether.zendesk.com |
| **Physical address**  | [280 Park Ave 41st Floor New York, NY 10017](https://www.google.com/maps/search/280%20Park%20Ave%2041st%20Floor%20New%20York,%20NY%2010017) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Stuck downloading at 63 percent. If you have this problem take it off Wi-fi. Solved the issue for me. Other than that easy to use except I couldn't find the option to add one of my kids.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 20:19:55__

> Testing was fast,easy.results were fast enough for me.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 15:41:07__

> Update: The app finally downloaded and I was able to get my results. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but I just left it at 63% and never closed the play store and it finally installed 100%. Old Review: App will not complete download. I've been trying to download now for 2 days and it stops at 63% and won't go no further. What a waste of time. Don't even bother. Just make the phone call to get your results.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 03:35:11__

> The app did what it was supposed to do. I had a little trouble downloading, but after that it worked for its intended purpose.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 18:08:45__

> My daughter and I took the test the same time and I haven't got hers<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:51:38__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-18 00:22:52__

> The app was helpful but would not allow me to change the date of birth to see other results attached to my phone number.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 18:02:03__

> I didn't encounter any download/login issues + really like the real time results. I just don't see the purpose of having to unlock my results after using a secure password and login to use the app each time. My info has been saved to my account so it seems over redundant to sign in to my account and then immediately turn around again to input more info. Due to my job requirements I get tested frequently throughout the week. So you could see why that could become an annoyance and prevent 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:46:54__

> I had to attempt it twice before i was successful. I think i was in a hurry and stressed to get the results.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 16:25:58__

> Useless impossible to navigate<br> :date: __2020-12-06 13:49:19__

> Does not work with older phones.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 02:14:33__

> Had same problem as prior reviewer. Trying to download app and it keeps hanging at 63%. Too bad. Guess I'll let it sit a while and see if it downloads eventually. :(<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:01:35__

> Unable to get paper copy of report to give employer<br> :date: __2020-12-22 18:47:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:49:30__

> I think it's a great app. But it should also have the option to open a spouse's or a relativ6es results with their approval of course but not just because it's tied to or related to phone #. I'm in Georgia n my husband is in Florida and he sent his test results link but it does not open me.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:40:22__

> All it does is show results. There is nothing in this app for tracing, etc. All it does is show your results and even that, they only appear hours, day after it is issued. Don't see the point of this app... Really.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:19:49__

> it's a good system, they just don't tell u the next step in this process, no one told me when to get retested or to self isolate, just a little more helpful info would be nice<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:30:16__

> Thank you for your suggestion. After clearing the Google Play cache it froze again at 63% (same as before). Then I had to cancel the download again and then try again and then it worked.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 13:18:36__

> App doesn't download<br> :date: __2020-12-20 23:53:55__

> I don't understand. What is the purpose of signing on here if we already received our results?<br> :date: __2020-12-20 22:30:25__

> I too am having difficulty downloading this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 23:29:39__

> Well, Healthy Reviews has reached Florida just in time to screw up my life. As other reviewers have mentioned, I'm stuck at 63% and the stupid app won't install past that. Don't you guys at Twenty Inc. think there might be a problem? (New review) I appreciate the answer from Twenty Inc. I managed to get the app d/l on my own a couple of days later using many years of experience with PCs. However, my Covid test results were not there or in MyChart where CVS was supposed to post them.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 22:59:56__

> I have received the notification that my results are available, which I think it's fantastic and timely, however I can't get past my birthdate and relationship to patient.... I have not been able to see my results.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 03:37:53__

> Tried to install 5 times, never able to get it downloaded beyond 67%<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:02:54__

> I am not enjoying the app. It shows me a neg and a positive result for my dauvhtrts. I do t k n ow which is right. I have cared my daughter pediatrician and they don't know why I have two different results for my daughters<br> :date: __2020-12-18 19:24:53__

> It won't let me put in my birth year.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:16:51__

> Why did this app send me a Negative test result yesterday and Health Dept. Called me today and said it was Positive??<br> :date: __2020-12-14 00:10:11__

> I have 2 children under my same phone #. I only get results for myself but can't get the others because it only recognized me when logging in under phone #.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:18:44__

> I went and got my children and myself tested. The app stated that the results were ready for us all however, I'm trying to get the results for my oldest child, however it's not providing me results when the contact information is the same for all three individuals. Can someone please assist me in getting the information for my eldest child. Updated: The provider has the correct information and it was entered correctly, yet the results are still not showing for the my entire family.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:50:22__

> Very slow to down load. Does not ask if your a spouse. Keeps saying not connect. The time took 1 hour.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:38:01__

> This application is a total disaster! Have tried 5 time download it to get my results and it never worked. I am glad that my health care provider was able to give me my results and didn't have to deal with this trash of application. Leave it to the Florida department of health to choose the crappiest application to deal with such an important process! What a joke!!<br> :date: __2020-12-26 20:13:55__

> Can't get on my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-26 17:26:22__
