<br>A provider portal enables providers to categorize patient cases by severity and mitigate risks of public spread by providing all patients with knowledge and resources to deal with low-risk symptoms at home, while also tracking the development of symptoms in higher-risk patients.
<br>This app allows to help patients to stay home if they are not high risk, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please the CDC website at:

<br>- Providers can register patients by giving them a facility-specific QR code to scan and download the app.
<br>- Integrated with Fitbit, Withings, HealthKit, CCD, CDA, DICOM, HL7, FHIR and patient portals.
<br>- Mass enrollment module via text messaging for population registration invite.
<br>- Preliminary and followup surveys will be pushed to the patient via the app.
<br>- Patient survey results will appear in the provider portal (Command Center) and will be automatically color-coded by severity of case.
<br>- Surveys can be sent to targeted groups at specific frequencies via push notification, email, or text.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
