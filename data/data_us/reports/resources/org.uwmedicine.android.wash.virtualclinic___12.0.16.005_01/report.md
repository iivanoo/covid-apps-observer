## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was routed into this after calling a UW primary care. Initial experience was okay. Then tried to reconnect after a couple of weeks. Waited in queue for 3 days only to be dumped out after hours of waiting each day. Do the Drs. know how many patients are in their queue? When they quit, patients just seem to get cut off. On third day app tried to transfer me to a different Dr. but just cycled endlessly. Seems like Drs. can't finish their queues rationally.<br> :date: __2020-03-20 22:59:46__

> Unusable, just keeps giving me a notice that my internet was interrupted then prompting me to press "okay" and refreshing to do it again.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 18:06:18__

> Has a bug, keeps telling me I need internet access even though I'm on wi-fi<br> :date: __2021-03-22 01:44:38__

> unable to open app.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 23:44:38__

> This app can't be used. It always say we're upgrading your experience.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 21:03:56__

> The clinic is a rip-off. The Doctors are subcontractors who can't help you with anything UW and just read you Mayo Clinic sparknotes. They couldn't answer anything about Covid-19 testing/screening even though they list th at as a feature in the app. It's a waste of $35 dollars and is practically fraud considering how they rush your meeting while dodging every question as "They Don't Know". Worse yet I called the UW Helpline and they falsely claimed that this was nessasary for appointments now.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 19:15:10__

> Could not locate my record..??<br> :date: __2020-05-27 18:23:44__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. Don't be deceived because it says UW Medicine! The UW has partnered with American Well(Amwell) in Boston and they run this clinic. Saw a virtual "DR" who was worthless for 3/4 minutes. He ordered a prescription for me but never transmitted to pharmacy. Amwell even "double dipped" into my bank account also. Beware, beware, beware of this app and don't use. It's not UW Drs that you get to see! Update: UW is cutting ties with Amwell on June 30, 2020. Yay!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 23:08:01__

> I had all the symptoms for covid except feverish temperature. Since it was difficult to get an appt at the dr. I decided to use the app to get checked, i was on the wait line for a good hr till my phone screen turned off. I opened my phone again, the app had refreshed so i had to register my patient info, symptoms,etc again. I was 31st person on the wait list, my screen timed out again and this happened another 2-3 times over 5hrs till i just gave up.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:03:39__

> Does not function, forced to rely on an app that spits me out of the queue. AWFUL.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 00:00:32__

> When I was signing up, I didn't know that there is a word limit so I tried to abbreviate and by the time I press continue, it says, my time expired so I started again. Then I started waiting under Dr Rueda at 11:47 am and by 1:23 pm I received a message that the Dr is no longer available. What? Why? Patients are in pain why the added pain. Have mercy<br> :date: __2020-03-23 22:03:39__
