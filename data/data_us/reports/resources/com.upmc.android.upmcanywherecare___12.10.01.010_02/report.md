## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:38:06__

> This app has saved me hours of drive time to and from specialists for me and my daughter. The providers have always been knowledgeable, helpful, and take time to listen to my concerns. I had an issue with my daughter's visit. While we both have UPMC, we each have different plans. I was unable to add her insurance and had to pay $59 for her visit, but later had it refunded. If that glitch is fixed I'll change my review to 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 04:14:08__

> Video was jumpy but convenient<br> :date: __2020-04-21 01:03:45__

> Good except the wait was long.<br> :date: __2020-02-24 14:00:05__

> Not bad...just strange to talk to some on the phone and they give u medical advice. But so much better than guessing what you may have by searching online. That aspect it's really nice. So just keep taking over the counter meds.<br> :date: __2019-12-30 18:47:04__

> The first time I tried calling the doctor was not able to hear me but see me. The second time I logged in I was able to get a new doctor and she was able to see me and hear me and gave me counsel and helped me.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 19:22:04__

> App is great when u get connected.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 23:33:17__

> The nurse was very efficient. However, we had a hard time getting the call through properly. She could hardly hear me on her end. I had to wait for over 2 hours to be seen. Then she seemed to rush me through. I spent about 3 minutes total in my call. In the end though she gave me a prescription. I don't know if I would use this again.<br> :date: __2020-03-17 20:08:08__

> Provider was wonderful but video not good. First time I was able to get to the doc video failed and call was dropped. Second time provider could see me but I could only see black screen<br> :date: __2020-03-15 16:52:25__

> I keep getting booted from virtual visit<br> :date: __2020-11-03 05:14:21__

> Used the app as told to do by my PCP doctor and insurance company(UPMC). Got charged $60 (when told fees are waived by insurance company) just to see a doctor after a 2 hour wait and be refered for COVID testing. Called UPMC was told they where refunding my $60 and would take 7-10 business days to reflect on my credit card, yet never got a refund and now it is "to late" to process a refund. Save your time and money, go to the ER or walk-in clinic.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 05:18:39__

> Out of nowhere for no reason it's suddenly kicked me on would not let me back in. No matter how hard I tried, it locked me out.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 06:47:25__

> concept is nice but I just wasted 15 dollars. all they told me was go in to the doctors. going in would be nice if I could take time off to do it. which is why I did this in the first place. frustrating......<br> :date: __2019-04-11 05:51:33__

> UPMC rocks in real life, their IT is not so much fun. The number of times I got an error message; if they were dollar bills I'd own a good chunk of the profits. Error message after error message no matter how carefully I entered sensitive information. I gave up trying to get a Virtual Appointment. Found out they had my information entered incorrectly and guess what, I had to engage a person to fix it. Including an email and a phone call and a lot of headaches.<br> :date: __2019-04-10 02:34:09__

> na<br> :date: __2019-02-18 22:33:26__

> Do you really have to have UPMC insurance....if so that should be made clear... so I have to delete the app disappointing<br> :date: __2018-10-18 16:57:57__

> I tried it out late tonight due to experiencing UTI symptoms that I'm too 
uncomfortable with to wait til morning to go to an urgent care for. The 
site closed a few times while I was filling out my info, and the nurse 
practitioner I was connected with was not at all friendly, very curt and 
abrupt like I was bothering her or something. She listened to my symptoms 
and said she would have a prescription sent in to my chosen 
pharmacy...which I'm still waiting to hear from saying the prescription had 
even been called in. Maybe its just because its the middle of the night and 
things are slowed down, but I'm in pain here! I hope it goes through soon 
or else they charged me $50 for nothing<br> :date: __2018-08-07 06:45:42__

> Needs to be de-bugged. Repeatedly tried to get past naming my Pharmacy and the process would crash and then I had to re-enter all of my data. Finally resorted to the PC version and everything worked out great.<br> :date: __2017-09-11 00:14:39__

> keeps crashing<br> :date: __2021-05-04 12:10:35__

> I can never get the video connection to work on this app, yet have no problems at all connecting to virtual visits on the MyUPMC app. I have no idea why this app never works. Providers never called me back after they cancel the call, so a waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 10:45:51__

> I can never get into my account and no idea why????<br> :date: __2021-04-15 05:26:09__

> Tried 4 times to connect. Wasted an hour, very frustrating. Three times the doctors canceled the visit because it wouldn't connect. Once the doctor finalized the visit even though it didn't connect.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 18:23:25__

> Do NotLike this<br> :date: __2020-12-11 00:54:42__

> I tried the video appt. I dont mind waiting. Honestly an hour & 1/2 isn't bad when youre home & not doc office. So the convenience of it (in theory) is a wonderful idea. The 2 attempts for an appt were more headache than necessary. 1st attempt I was kept waiting with 1 person in front of me for nearly 2 hours. 2nd try the 6 patients before me went fast. My turn and the doc cant get video working and cancels on me - no phone call. This isn't a good tool if the med staff cant operate the tech.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 01:56:58__

> I honestly feel very leery about all this and also i dont think it is being very honest as a chronic care patient of my personal MD. Dr. David Tucker... I have very much high respect for him because he is a very caring, and a complete genious!! I have been with my Dr. for over 10 year's now!!.. He has been great and i have been great and able to be seizure free and anxiety free majority of the time! Plus ive got some horrible spinal scoliosis along with arthritus through my whole back.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 12:46:15__

> Nope, will not load, keeps saying internet interrupted try again. Funny my internet was good enough to download the app. Tried several times. Install uninstall repeat with the same result.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 15:30:26__

> forced to dl app because there are no mds in the employee health office. bs. had to delete apps i use.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 16:52:24__

> App keeps crashing or restarting. Cannot get connected to a doctor. Extremely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-09-23 12:36:37__
