### Description
> Take 30 seconds every day to fight COVID-19. Your daily health check-ins help doctors and scientists anticipate the next outbreak and get ahead of the coronavirus. The first time you download the app and share how you feel, we’ll donate a meal to people in need through Feeding America.
<br>The How We Feel app only asks you to self-report age, gender, postal code and any health symptoms you’re experiencing. It does not ask you to sign in with your name, phone number or email address. The data is securely shared with select scientists, doctors and public health professionals who are actively working to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>The How We Feel app was built by an independent, nonprofit organization called The How We Feel Project. Our organization was founded by a volunteer team of scientists, public health researchers and technologists. Our mission is to make the world healthier by connecting citizens with the global health and research community. The organization was created in March, 2020 to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>We are proud to be working with scientists, doctors and public health professionals from leading institutions including McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
<br>We are collaborating with Dr. Gary King from Harvard University’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science’s Privacy Insights Project. Dr. King specializes in developing technologies to make data available to researchers while protecting participants’ individual identities.
<br>Our technology team includes Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest and a volunteer group of current and former Pinterest employees.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | The How We Feel Project, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.howwefeel.org](https://www.howwefeel.org) |
| **Email** | info@howwefeel.org |
| **Physical address**  | [949 Bridge Rd San Leandro, CA 94577](https://www.google.com/maps/search/949%20Bridge%20Rd%20San%20Leandro,%20CA%2094577) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I enjoy helping in this way. It also brings an awareness of our health and a reminder to follow the Guidelines. Gov Baker advised people should be getting out, enjoying a short ride or walking to the park. Not sure where this app went.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 07:29:02__

> Is the app still useful???? Since a week ago, I don't receive the information of how many people are not feeling well, and the number that are good is really low!! So I became to doubt about the information is true. Also, if this app is really useful for medical purposes you're missing the people with asthma and high blood pressure. Hope to improve the app, or is it the time to delete it?? Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 15:26:38__

> Update broke the app. Unable to open.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 13:37:49__

> Felt like I was contributing to tracking COVID 19 but then there were questions about my emotional health which I felt had nothing to do with tracking the virus.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 05:26:07__

> Removing some stars for the new update since the app now crashes on launch every time, so I'm no longer able to use. Once this is resolved I'll go back to 5 stars<br> :date: __2020-10-15 22:10:27__

> Stopped working. I had checked in for 5 months.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:42:43__

> Since latest update on 10/5/2020, app consistently has glitches, won't open<br> :date: __2020-10-11 18:06:42__

> App was great - just started crashing 2 days ago and keeps failing. Sent an error report to Google but not sure what's going on.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 05:39:36__

> App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 06:06:13__

> I have had to delete and reinstall the app twice now. Each time I lost all the history. The app is dynamic and keeps changing some things that were easy to read and understand are now hard to interpret. some days the app will have me check in more than once and the history will still be blank for that day.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 04:30:10__

> The app stopped working<br> :date: __2020-12-24 23:47:41__

> When I first download this I was super excited to see how this app works. Turns out is does not work at all. When you open the app all it says is app is not responding please open app again or close app. I tried to open the app again and it says the same thing every time. What a waste of time, don't get this app unless you want to waste your time.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:13:43__

> The app will not run on my Galaxy S 10+. It cones up and stops within a second or 2. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multple times.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 14:14:54__

> Update sucks, can no longer scroll through numbers from past dates. Numbers for total cases and icu cases are often wrong showing the same digits for both categories.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 07:37:52__

> Doesn't work anymore. Don't know why. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, still doesn't work!<br> :date: __2020-11-22 16:25:11__

> UPDATE: 11/20/20 This App has NOT WORKED, at all, since 10/5. I have uninstalled. There are reviews giving this App 5 stars dated after 11/01, stating how 'easy' the App is, they are lies! The App USED to be easy, simple & great but it NO LONGER WORKS! 10/05/20; The "update" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message. I've sent feedback @ least 3x, with no reply back. (I really liked daily checkin & seein my states info on a easy grid.)<br> :date: __2020-11-21 01:44:33__

> I've responded 175 times since downloading. After the last update the app wont open at all. I also fond the data dashboard they provide me to be confusing and sometimes contradictory to what is happening in the news. They also provide old content/tips for multiple days. This should be updated daily if they want me to respond daily.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 15:09:08__

> App has stopped working<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:37:32__

> 10/26/20 Have not been able to open app in weeks. Was really good. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. 11/16/20 app still doesn't open. You are missing a good chunk of reporting by the looks of the recent reviews.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 16:15:39__

> Ever since the last update, I can't use the app. It crashes every time I try to open it<br> :date: __2020-11-14 09:45:23__
