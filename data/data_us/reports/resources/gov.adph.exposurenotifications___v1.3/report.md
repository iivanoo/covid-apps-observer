### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Alabama Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | alabamapublichealth@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [201 Monroe Street Montgomery, Alabama 36104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/201%20Monroe%20Street%20Montgomery,%20Alabama%2036104) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Everyone in Alabama needs to download this. It doesn't work at all. If you catch covid and use this app you get to sue the developer as well as the state of Alabama. Definitely a better payout than a stimulus check.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 16:41:29__

> When trying to report test results, it only says "Server Failure" and won't allow them to be reported. Makes me very skeptical about others being able to report positive tests and alert others. This app has one very important function and it's failing to do its one job.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 00:17:48__

> The app itself was easy enough to set up. I think most of the issues people are having with this all is not understanding it won't work as accurately if more people don't use it, and people not understanding how the technology works. I will continue to use the app and update my review later.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 07:41:56__

> The Whole Problem With This Is Unless Everyone Uses App Kinda Useless Because No Matter How Many People I Try To Educate On The Importance Of Everyone Doing This No One Sees The Importance ! Needs To Be Mandatory !<br> :date: __2020-11-23 03:04:20__

> Is there a way to report a coworker's positive test result?<br> :date: __2020-11-20 05:03:21__

> Just started the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 21:03:09__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-10-18 23:44:48__

> It works<br> :date: __2020-10-11 15:57:28__

> No issues. Does this share exposure notifications with the other notification apps or only with users of this app?<br> :date: __2020-08-23 14:57:47__

> No issues downloading. I agree with a previous review, it would be more useful if it was utilized by more people. But i do feel better that this tool is avaliable! Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 14:39:51__

> Why hasn't it updated since December 13th!?<br> :date: __2020-12-19 00:11:33__

> The app started working wonderfully. But at the end of October, it stopped. No new upgrades and no notifications. I will try and download the app again.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 13:31:12__

> Great if it would work. I tested positive and want to alert others by using the app. When it asks me to verify the code sent to my phone, I can't because it never sends the code. I've tried over and over.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 18:35:17__

> None<br> :date: __2020-11-25 00:11:08__

> Up front everything is bluetooth, bluetooth, bluetooth. Then after install the app demands location, too. Good privacy policy, but I can't leave both bluetooth and location on at all times or my phone would have to stay on the charger 24/7. Maybe my fault for having an old phone. I'll leave it installed and just enable everything as the Austin e demands.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 21:28:03__

> it would be better if it reported an estimate of how many unique devices it detected and has checked itself against just to know it is working and seeing other people with the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 17:07:14__

> I just wish more people used it. I kinda feel like it is not useful since people have to opt in for each aspect... BUT I will keep using it as long as this pandemic drags on.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 14:09:40__

> Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American<br> :date: __2020-10-12 15:50:41__

> Works but Annoyed - had this for UAB support, though it kept saying I had been exposed, the problem my phone was charging at the time it said the exposure happened on 2 different days at the same time of day (late Sunday evenings) I didn't go anywhere during those timeframes. It has to be binging off one of my neighbors but I had to quarantine and not attend classes. I've now removed it.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 08:18:57__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 01:12:50__

> Doesn't seem to work. My wife and I both have this installed. She tested positive, I went through the process of telling the app she was positive. And I never received a notification that I had been exposed. I noticed that her bluetooth was off. I turned it back on, waited a couple of days and tried the notification process again and verified that her bluetooth was still on. I still didn't get an exposure notification. I've been a big advocate for this technology... Why isn't it working?<br> :date: __2020-12-18 13:58:55__

> App questionnaire requires email verification, but doesn't work, so don't bother. If that basic feature does not work then how can you rely on it to correctly perform contact tracing?! This is not an in consequential function. Get it right!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 19:27:11__

> It would work better if more people had it on their phones.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 18:54:55__

> App is a joke if no one is reporting they have covid. Daughter tested postive and i am exposed. App never notified me.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 21:14:34__

> Worthless. Not everyone is using it, and it doesn't connect to any other states. So basically you've just just installed an app that connects to no one. And now it hasn't bothered checking for exposure in over a month?! Uninstalled and moving on.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 20:52:18__

> Since this app is suppose to alert people on whom has covid it never did even to this day alert me about my roommate who has covid ... So now im quarantining because this app is b.s.😒 using up my memory and sh\*\**<br> :date: __2020-12-16 03:36:49__

> Do you waste your time on this app<br> :date: __2020-12-12 11:51:58__

> Not interested in having big brother track me<br> :date: __2020-12-10 04:36:37__

> As others report, bluetooth required at download suddenly becomes must turn on location as well. And I had the same issue with no updates for over a week during Thanksgiving. Seeing only 200 downloads as of today makes this virtually useless. Uninstalling<br> :date: __2020-12-07 22:55:48__

> Opened the app to report a positive test and found out it hasn't updated since Nov 26 (its currently Dec 4). All of my settings are correct, my Bluetooth and location stay on anyway. It took several tries over the course of a few minutes to get it to save my test input which is like, there is literally one thing this app is for. Why can it not just do the thing. I'm asymptomatic but if I was sick sick I wouldn't have the energy to fight to get it to post.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 02:40:57__

> I tested positive and I can't get the verification sms to my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-01 20:25:23__

> App doesnt work, turns off your bluetooth which is needed for the app to work.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 15:05:51__

> The app has serious bugs. Mine doesn't let me past the "Your Privacy is Safe" screen even after clicking the disclaimer and clicking on the green "more" button.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:22:21__
