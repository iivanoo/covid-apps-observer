## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Needs to be able to add antique vehicles. Can't seem to add vehicles with Horseless Carriage plates.<br> :date: __2021-04-05 18:10:09__

> As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 23:30:04__

> Works well. Good list of resourses<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:45:41__

> Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 15:50:58__

> Very practical<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:31:00__

> The app is great and is very convenient specially sens you don't ever go anywhere with out our phones so you always have your id with you this way! I just wish you were able to use it at more places and able to use it to cash checks and wat not but besides those few things it's an amazing idea thanks alot<br> :date: __2021-02-14 06:06:20__

> 2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. 👍When this app is working, its amazing.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 05:22:11__

> When and if I'm allowed to use this electronic ID to show to a cop I should be able to "lock" everything else so cop can stop and prevent snooping in my phone other than the ID itself.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 17:03:23__

> Can't get it to scan my id in????<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:16:20__

> Keeps crashing when I try to upload an insurance ID card. Everything else is awesome!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 20:44:35__

> This app saved my life but now it keep saying retry otp and now I can't use it for my I'd. How I'm supposed to buy my essential things with no I'd!<br> :date: __2020-09-25 20:54:47__

> Photo Capture does not work properly for live photo of physical face!! Has already provided feedback for the app developers 👍<br> :date: __2020-08-19 02:03:21__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> Only after 10 attempts (using my new DL that just arrived in the mail earlier that day) was it able to register my driver's liscence in the virtual wallet. Other than taking forever to scan my documents, the app is pretty darn good.<br> :date: __2020-07-29 04:06:34__

> It keeps showing error all the time I try to upload my insurance cards<br> :date: __2021-04-09 15:41:45__

> In my house and put that in your house In<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:02:00__

> To verify the first time it requires you to use facial recognition by framing your face in an oval. After three attempts, each time the app just sits there, no way to verify the facial recognition, no way to do over, just nothing. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 01:43:26__

> Terrible third-party software for text verification and face ID.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 02:33:43__

> The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:30:27__

> MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 03:49:21__

> Can't start up error for days<br> :date: __2021-03-03 00:17:19__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Bizarre bug. The camera is not picking up much light. I know it's the app because my camera works in other apps. I was trying to set up my ID which requires a selfie for facial verification. I set up multiple photography lights and it was still way too dark in the app.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 03:27:54__

> S21Ultra. App is unable to use appropriate camera, resulting in an inability to take a picture of my ID, rendering the app useless to me.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 16:46:45__

> Barcode will not scan, uninstall<br> :date: __2021-04-09 14:23:57__

> Turn off all accesses like location and storage they will use this to spy and gather data<br> :date: __2021-04-09 11:33:12__

> i have a resident hunting license and fishing license(military), but because i dont have a colorado id i cant make an account lmao<br> :date: __2021-04-09 04:37:17__

> I wanted to like this app. Downloaded the app, scanned my license, verification code was successful. Boom I'm in. Not so fast. If you try to look at anything it says they need to verify you via face recognition. I tried 10 times (ten) and it kept saying error we can't identify you. DELETE,see ya.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 02:27:09__

> Very slow. Repeating authentication. Wants video evidence to access fishing license. Too painful to use in current state.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 23:58:36__

> Completely worthless so far...kinda like cotrip.... was finally able to create login after several failed attempts. Turned on finger print verification and all permissions, but just get stuck forever on "authentication verified" page.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 23:57:09__

> The facial recognition won't recognize my face. I just took my new photo for my ID TODAY, I don't look any different. I literally took a picture of my face on my new ID and it STILL won't recognize me. This is useless if I can't use it. Why use facial recognition in the first place? Thumb print is good enough for anything else.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 20:20:48__

> Says the server is down when I attempt to create an account. Been doing this for a week and no change.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 03:17:19__
