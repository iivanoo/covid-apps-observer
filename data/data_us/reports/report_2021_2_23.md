The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This picks up most of the places I go, and I check when I get home so I can add places it has missed or change inaccurate locations, which only happens when I am in an area with a lot of stores, like a plaza. My home state has not chosen an app so I use this one.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 22:03:28__

> I just dont have room on my phone:(<br> :date: __2020-07-06 11:55:41__

> The early release back in April was rough (didn't log any stops for me). But it's been working well for me since about May 4. It occasionally logs more than one stop at the same location. It occasionally gets the name of the location wrong, but this is very easy to correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 06:25:30__

> Doesn't this app use the Contact Tracking System that Apple and Google developed?<br> :date: __2020-06-02 15:29:17__

> Simple app. Does what it was designed for but little else. Misses many locations and frequently has location accuracy issues. Routinely misses my home by 6 blocks. Says I have visited locations I have just driven past. Would be nice to have ability to add locations that I visited but app failed to record.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 15:52:32__

> Each week, 2 out of the 5 days I'm at work there's no entry. Yesterday it showed me in the middle of road halfway to work for 8.5 hours. If I stop somewhere on my way home from work, half the time it misses it. I have a Pixel 3 XL. I want to have this app work.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:21:53__

> App runs unnoticeably in the background. However, requires constant maintenance. If I go more than 2-3 days without monitoring the app, I find that it stops tracking my locations, at which point I need to go back through all intro screens as if I just installed the app (Region, Consent, Home location, etc). Back arrow on Android while in the Places You've Visited will also return to the initial menu and require passing through all intro screens again, or app will not resume tracking. Should have a warning, and consent/home location should be saved in a more permanent cache.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:23:18__

> Doesn't catch all locations, and it recorded a one hour visit to one store as 12 minutes, then would not allow correction.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:10:23__

> Quit recording anything after about three weeks.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 05:30:54__

> Inaccurate didn't track me for days sometimes. Uninstalled it, that bad.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 03:31:36__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light. Some days it gives no information at all.. i reloaded it a couple of weeks ago. It worked well until July 3 then quit working, not registering any locations.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 20:23:07__

> It's not all that<br> :date: __2020-06-18 15:59:46__

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is worth the download. You get a lot of notifications, but they are easy to mute, and might save your life.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 22:03:12__

> Really good weather alerts better than local tv<br> :date: __2021-01-26 10:34:47__

> So I love this app, but I feel as if you guys should check the reviews. There are people there with legitimate concerns, and some great recommendations that your should take look at. Such as: -Missing Alerts -A "Follow Me" option. -A priority alert mode (that fully covers your screen when you get a warning alert). I had a tornado warning in my area, and I love that I recieved it when using the app, but you should force the users to see a warning. These are the 3 options I'd love to see come.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 03:51:39__

> It has a lot of information anyone would ever need in this nation you could help you self and others in anything<br> :date: __2020-11-25 07:22:21__

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Great app !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-05 02:06:16__

> Overall decent, but I don't need 17 alerts in one hour for the same storm.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 01:10:21__

> It's missing the alerts Snow Squall Warning, Inland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, and Inland Tropical Storm Watch.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 22:57:25__

> Fast reliablie services<br> :date: __2020-07-09 01:04:27__

> Works, but it keeps announcing the same alerts over and over, almost to the point of harassment! Also, the developer evidently does not read user comments, because they have not replied to any, a lot of which contain very good suggestions.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:07:44__

> Downloaded b/c we live in the country and cant hear sirens. Ive been getting notifications of weather advisories, but not able to read what, theres nothing there<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:56:35__

> Not much exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:03:49__

> Not as helpful as before<br> :date: __2020-12-28 07:32:52__

> They did not explain what she was asking me about and was real short with me . To me she was rude but I need my house fixed not TVs or other stuff like that but thank you for what you did do.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:49:29__

> Also I build homeless shelters and I think this would be the place to add my location make it official<br> :date: __2020-10-06 07:13:34__

> Works but would multiply the same alerts<br> :date: __2020-10-03 19:46:59__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a "no wifi" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 18:35:21__

> Not enough details on alerts. Not worth the space on my phone<br> :date: __2020-09-11 00:11:01__

> Was a great App, then started sending multiple alerts one after another. Now I get NO alerts at all. If I click on Alerts, click my city, it takes me to settings. I wrote you about it, you sent an email telling me to restart because you fixed a bug on the 4th. It is now the 14th. I've done as you said, even uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I still get no alerts and when I click my city, it still takes me to settings. I loved your App, it's a shame it no longer functions correctly.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 21:54:56__

> Super irregular performance and notifications. I cannot rely on this for requested information or results<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:22:01__

> Need more control over types of alerts. Don't need to be woken from deep sleep at 3 am for fog warning, for instance. Fog won't harm me when safe in bed in sturdy house unless I hurt myself being startled in my sleep by loud notification.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:17:51__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> I am deleting this app. I get 6 or more notifications a day when we are getting 2-4 inches of snow. It wakes me in the middle of the night to update when I have already recieved the same notification before. It's too bad, I liked getting the bitter windchill warning. If the weather was serious it would be fine but I don't consider 4 inches of snow a blizzard.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 00:50:48__

> Into a busy season and it's worse (after weather alert this morning there have been at least 5 false/blank alerts). Even after clearing cache, rebooting phone, etc still getting multiples of same exact alerts and several alerts with little or no lead time and now (once again) many - almost 40% - warnings with no info at all or nothing updated in the alert information. That's probably FEMA but still seriously downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:00:29__

> I just installed this. I hope it works as it should because my phone has been modified to stop me from receiving ANY Emergency alerts. (I believe that's illegal.) I am so desperate to receive Emergency Alerts that I'm downloading an outside app for it!<br> :date: __2021-02-13 17:10:52__

> Why wasn't there an alert when the POTUS called the state of emergency for DC? He even mentioned FEMA for receiving info yet crickets feo FEMA. Z Typical government restrictions. If they block adding Washington D.C. as an area then they are blocking additional information. It will only have the activity they want you to know about. New rule for citizens. See something say nothing. You'll be safer that way.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 21:44:55__

> Stopped working a few days ago. Started sending empty alerts. Reinstallation didn't help. Wouldn't accept location input.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:46:26__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> more f<br> :date: __2020-08-06 01:07:34__

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> The Location Diary fails to report some places I've been and is inaccurate on many of the rest.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:11:35__

> Works fine, though doesn't seem to update daily on my tracking. 7/11/2020 tracking seems to be working fine now.<br> :date: __2020-07-11 22:18:17__

> Location function does not appear to be consistent. Some days are partially accurate and some days are not accurate at all.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 19:50:08__

> I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the "No thanks" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:12:33__

> This is not accurately tracking location. Update: Even after installing the update, it is not accurately tracking my location. Sometimes it shows me at an address down the street from my home all day rather than my house. Other days it doesn't record any location at all.

What is the point of participating in this if the data is going to be incorrect. I hope this can be fixed or at least have an option to correct Locations ourselves.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

> I don't see how this app can be helpful at all for contact tracing. Few people in Arizona I know are aware of this app, and even if they're informed about it, it doesn't even appear in a general search with keywords. Then it will randomly inform you that you have a notification and, when you click to find out what it is, it will tell you that you have no notifications. You'll have an icon that sits in your notifications for 12 hours telling you that it's looking for exposures that can't be dismissed. Also, you can't even choose Phoenix nor Maricopa County as your location despite that being the most populous region of the state; your options are Tucson, Flagstaff, and "State of Arizona" which apparently isn't even functional.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 20:07:20__

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> Deleted immediately. Way too many permissions, microphone & other permissions are more than what is needed. Buggy. Google is awful.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 05:09:34__

> This app only works for UofA & NAU and isn't on the CDC's list so trying to find it is challenging. What are the developers waiting for, especially with the current spike in Arizona? It dosen't do any good to share this with others if no one can add there positive diagnosis in an unsupported region (meaning the rest of the state).<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:02:59__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:19:06__

### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. 
<br>Anonymously Share Positive Test Results With COVIDWISE:
<br>When VDH receives any positive COVID-19 lab result registered with a valid mobile phone number, we will automatically send a text message to that individual, which provides rapid notification and encourages them to stay home and away from other people. The text also lets individuals who have tested positive know they may retrieve an 8-digit verification code from the COVIDWISE Verification Portal at https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/CWP. You must enter your last name, date of birth, and the phone number that matches the information from your registered COVID-19 test to verify your positive result.
<br>You may use that 8-digit verification code in order to anonymously report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I will admit, I felt so much better about life when this app came out. I wish it were mandatory for all Virginians just like our masks. We would be more efficient at slowing the spread, if it were mandatory and working properly. Unfortunately, my exposure notification hasn't updated since January 5, 2021after working great for months. Please help! I want to be part of the solution. Cannot do that if the app isnt working properly. I keep my bluetooth on at all times, that's not the problem.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:08:59__

> Edit: apparently you need a pin to report positive. Rating is only 3* This is a very well made app! I'm a person who values my privacy, and this app is made in a way which respects that. It doesn't record location. It give each phone an anonymous ID and uses Bluetooth to tell which others IDs you were near. If any of those IDs report they have COVID, any othrt ID they were nearby within the past 2 weeks gets an alert.

> Never really got to see how the app worked. Got COVID, but never got a number to enter my positive results in the app. I'm a construction Project Manager and have been on jobsites with lots of COVID cases, and have worked at retirement communities with outbreaks. I never got a notification that I may have been exposed. I assume this is largely due to the barriers in entering positive results.

As an essential deliver driver, this app should had alerted me at least 5 times now. I have delivered to a home that was tested positive and never get an alert about it. This is a waste of space on my phone. Please be aware there are people out here that test positive and refuse to let others know.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 21:14:46__

> I want to like this because it seems like a great contact tracing tool but I had to enter a building with people who have tested positive for COVID and are in isolation for work.

> I wanted to alert people about possible exposure to Covid as soon as I recieved my positive results but was unable to due to the verification code requirement. I called all over the place and sent out emails and got no closer ro alerting people until 6 days after my positive test when the Washoe County Health department called for contact tracing and gave me the code. So it appears that the app works but you probably won't be notified about exposures for about a week after someone tests positive<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:15:25__

> Love this app<br> :date: __2020-12-07 12:52:21__

> Kind of a pointless app when after your test positive literally no one that contacts you knows the code necessary to self report.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 05:05:47__

> I mean, sure, I suppose it'd work, but let's be real. The chances of anyone between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies actually self-reporting is kind of on the low end. This makes the app basically useless. Something like it in Korea, that'd work fine, since they take contact tracing seriously<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:02:59__

> Couldn't reload app to get time and day to reload.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:27:23__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ????? I am stuck in a loop.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 18:30:48__

> Requires having Bluetooth on at all times which drains my battery. It also keeps giving me drop down notifications even though I disabled notifications. I have an android.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 17:34:36__

> No exp. yet- just wondering- if u really want to PREVENT the spread of covid, wouldn't it be better to come up with an app that tracks actual outbreaks/cases, then alert ppl? Or, if I'm going into a high risk area. Let me kno? I'm pretty much buggered if I've already been exposed. Jus sayin<br> :date: __2020-10-14 05:27:02__

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I wish more people used the app and the ones who have it check in.

This makes this app useless with less than 0.009% user engagement, assuming the everyone who has installed this app is from Delaware - it is actually less.

### Description
> CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Palm Beach County, Florida, a diverse community of over a million and a half people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Palm Beach County BoCC |
| **Website**  | [https://combatcovidapp.com/pbc](https://combatcovidapp.com/pbc) |
| **Email** | info@combatcovidapp.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I accidentally marked myself covid positive by clicking a tab, it have a warning that did not ask me if I was covid positive but instead asked if I wanted to upload my information.

### Description
> Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. 
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple’s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. 
<br>Care19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. 
<br> 
<br>The downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Functionality of my device (android) slowed to near unusable, it was very "buggy" ie: Device would freeze up, apps closed without warning or would not open at all!

### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert](http://www.michigan.gov/micovidalert) |
| **Email** | mdhhs-micovidalert@michigan.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Stopped notifying me/updating alerts. Uninstalled app then reinstalled it. Alerts commenced once agai Have had first vaccine on 9th of January.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:08:14__

> I give it 4 stars needs improvement . but still great app.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 15:38:23__

> For the first ten days I had this installed Exposures were checked 2 - 3 times each day. As of this review, the last time Exposures were checked was four days ago. I've verified all settings on the phone as directed by the app. I've force stopped and restarted the app. Nothing seems to get it to begin checking exposures again. If not checking for exposures, what is the purpose of the app? Update:. Oddly shortly after posting the above, the app started updating exposures at least twice daily.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 23:05:53__

> I will if it ever downloads, still pending After 5 Minutes, tried again a few days later and it downloaded right away<br> :date: __2020-12-04 05:11:59__

> Sits quietly in the background doing it's thing with no battery degradation. Like to see a tab to show vaccination verification because eventually schools, businesses, concerts, theaters, airlines, etc will want to see proof of vaccination.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:55:30__

> So far I havent seen anything about exposures. It would be good if they told me how my county and town is doing.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:31:22__

> Unfortunately this app is not very useful. I was not even able to enter that I had COVID to alert anyone. It requires a number from the health department who never contacted me.

> Like others I think it is pointless if it doesn't check exposures for more than a month. And seeing the lazy copy and paste response to concerns by the developer makes it even worse because it shows lack of concern. Just stop making excuses and telling users to go to some website that won't change anything and improve your app. It's not the phone manufacturer's fault your app sucks.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 14:35:44__

### Description
> CombatCOVID MDC app is for Miami-Dade County coverage.
<br>CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Miami-Dade County, Florida, a diverse community of over 2.7 million people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app is built on old technology. The app needs to be open in order to detect other phones. It does not run in the background, so if you forget to open it before you leave home, it is useless. Not good for such a critical app. Google and Apple built Covid apps to run in the background but this one does not. I emailed the company 2 weeks ago and no response.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 19:02:14__

### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.

> I just wish more people used it. I kinda feel like it is not useful since people have to opt in for each aspect... BUT I will keep using it as long as this pandemic drags on. Update: This app is a fail. :( Very disappointed but not surprised at this point. It just stopped updating early Dec. Then 2 days ago it locked my phone up downloading. I had to force close & uninstall to stop it from locking up my phone. I wish this worked better.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 15:38:52__

> The app started working wonderfully. But at the end of October, it stopped. No new upgrades and no notifications. I will try and download the app again.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 13:31:12__

> Great if it would work. I tested positive and want to alert others by using the app. When it asks me to verify the code sent to my phone, I can't because it never sends the code. I've tried over and over.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 18:35:17__

> Up front everything is bluetooth, bluetooth, bluetooth. Then after install the app demands location, too. Good privacy policy, but I can't leave both bluetooth and location on at all times or my phone would have to stay on the charger 24/7. Maybe my fault for having an old phone. I'll leave it installed and just enable everything as the Austin e demands.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 21:28:03__

> it would be better if it reported an estimate of how many unique devices it detected and has checked itself against just to know it is working and seeing other people with the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 17:07:14__

> Giving a 3 star review now because I've not used this app on an Android device. I have both Android and iPhone devices. Upon reading reviews of when using on Android devices, as opposed to iPhone devices, I know my iPhone works in real time notifications. Update was recently done on this application, so I'm going to give it a try. He!l, in reality even it notifying a few days later is better than NOT BEING NOTIFIED AT ALL. I will update with a comparison review. Stay safe, do the right thing masks don't hurt ya, and vote. Truly, Your Fellow American<br> :date: __2020-10-12 15:50:41__

> As others have stated, when first downloaded this past fall, it notified me of possible exposures. However since December 16, it has been inactive.

> Doesn't seem to work. My wife and I both have this installed. She tested positive, I went through the process of telling the app she was positive. And I never received a notification that I had been exposed. I noticed that her bluetooth was off. I turned it back on, waited a couple of days and tried the notification process again and verified that her bluetooth was still on. I still didn't get an exposure notification.

### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut. It is supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT-DPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health departments.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Phones will record the keys generated by other phones nearby with the app installed. The app will record the:
<br> -  signal strength, and use that  to estimate the distance between devices, 
<br> -  duration of the contact and 
<br> -  date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State DPH or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, and false exposure notifications. CT-DPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CT-DPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CT-DPH to know where or who you are, for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google / Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CT-DPH.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CT Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | [http://ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct) |
| **Email** | DPH.covidalertct@ct.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [State of Connecticut Department of Public Health 410 Capital Avenue Hartford, CT,  06103](https://www.google.com/maps/search/State%20of%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health%20410%20Capital%20Avenue%20Hartford,%20CT,%2006103) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> The way I understand it, you only get notifications if an exposed person has downloaded this app and gives permission to share data. Those who have been exposed but saw no alert, the person may not have had this app. The app is only as accurate as the number of people using it; it's open-source data collection and completely voluntary. More residents should download this app.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:26:59__

> Just saw<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:25:39__

> I'm not sure how to rate this app (see the XKCD comic on tornado warnings). I'm mostly reviewing to point out a SERIOUS flaw in the design of this app. I live on the border w/ NY. NY has it's own identical app. I can not run both apps at the same time. So I have to pick between CT or NY. What is the reason for this and why is this administered by the states at all? Why isn't there a national app?<br> :date: __2020-12-19 03:49:17__

> They should have a nation wide one not state by state<br> :date: __2020-12-19 01:29:15__

> Im not going to test this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 15:53:24__

> After deep diving the privacy claims of this app, I feel given it's a fully voluntary system that if you're concerned about covid-19 infection/spread, this app is a useful tool to protect yourself/loved ones while also contributing to the greater good by stopping the spread. Unlike other w reviews, I have had no noticable battery issues B-LE feature on my Note 9. Lost 1 star for some UX bugs I'm sure will be resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 01:47:48__

> Impressive. I am impressed at the effort expended by the State of CT to ensure the safety of its residents, creating an app to track and notify exposure to the threat of a virus that kills approximately 1% of the population (not counting the elderly and those co-morbid), and at the same time continue with the virus-turned-political-weapon that is the COVID19/WUHAN virus. I recall an era when individuals whom presented a threat to the health of others were the ones quarantined. Ugh.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:16:10__

> I hope this updates with past exposures/past positive testers too since I just installed it & it's only providing new reports, of which it's currently empty. Also hope the Samsung Secure Folder installation glitch will be fixed soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 20:25:25__

> Bluetooth and location are always on. Significant battery drain. When a covid notification pops up, it does not take you to view that information. Rather you have to download the active app or you just get a spinning wheel.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 02:19:50__

> Easy to install, but I can't put a shortcut on my home screen. I have to search for it every time I want to open it. Everyone be safe.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 04:38:11__

<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 – even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 – especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push “Allow” COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to “Allow” your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also “Allow” your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | State of New Jersey  Applications |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html](https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

You come within 6 Feet for more than 10 minutes of an infected person AND #3 The infected person AGREES to allow the Tracers to access the app code information. What code? When your phone meets another phone ( see #1) a code is sent via bluetooth to both phones. The app remembers the code info. The tracer simply activates that code to send you an alert.

### Description
> This is the official app of New York State, run by the NYS Department of Health as part of New York State’s comprehensive COVID-19 testing and contact tracing effort. The ultimate goal is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by:
<br>1. Alerting you if a sick person spends 10 mins or more within 6 feet of you, because this puts you at a higher risk of SARS CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. 
<br>2. Encouraging you to contribute to the health and safety of your friends, family and community by alerting others if you test positive, WITHOUT REVEALING YOUR IDENTITY TO ANYONE!
<br>3. Getting you important resources and help if you are exposed or test positive. You can call the COVID Alert NY Hotline or find helpful links to resources on next steps to protect your loved ones.
<br>4. Keep a private log of your own symptoms which can help your health care provider and public health representatives determine next steps.
<br>The app leverages a completely private and secure Bluetooth-based technology that Apple and Google developed. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been vetted extensively by privacy and security experts. We never see your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New York.. Share this app with your friends and family so we can all be safer, together.

> It's a well designed app and is useful even if only for a convenient way to keep an eye on the charts. Of course the fact that it's opt-in is a limitation, but I really don't understand the complaints on this. People are saying they've never gotten an exposure notification like it's a bad thing. Are you sick with covid-19? If not, then what is the complaint exactly? You want false alarms?<br> :date: __2021-02-16 18:41:55__

> The app itself is fine. But the problem is the effectiveness of this app is limited by how few people install it. If you're the only person in town who has this app, it's useless. I've never received a notification from this app ever. I live in an area with almost 9% infection rate. I live in an apartment building and I've been out to supermarkets, etc. Not a single alert. As long as the app is not mandatory, it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 23:10:49__

> Just tested positive. Tried to send a notification to all codes I've come into contact with and app requires 6 digit code from a contact tracer. 1. So I'm going to sit here not being able to notify anyone until a contact tracer calls me? A day can mean the difference between life and death. 2. Give us the option to edit our symptoms today. I usually do it in the morning but developed a symptom this afternoon but it was too late, I had already submitted for the day.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 00:34:53__

> I understand privacy but for this app to truly work.... work related we make house calls but ask a series of questions before we enter the home. They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 22:08:36__

### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children
<br>under the age of 13.,
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |
| **Website**  | [https://www.pa.gov/covid/covid-alert-pa/](https://www.pa.gov/covid/covid-alert-pa/) |
| **Email** | RA-DH-CovidApp@pa.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks.

> Now that there's a vaccine why don't you show where there's a vaccine. It's great that you have this app available and I've been using it for 10 months but can we pivot to showing where vaccines are or trying to help out with where that is? It's great finding out about all the problems with COVID but now that there's actually a solution available it'd be good to know where to find them instead of going to 50 different websites<br> :date: __2021-02-02 04:03:23__

> I suggest adding PA stats about vaccinations....as well as info on or even ability to make a vaccine appointment...and current phase status<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:24:51__

> Bad this app should notify those doctor to go and give those the vacinne that have fill the information out not have people out in large line and groups with this you have better control create job to new nursing school student to help in is fight<br> :date: __2021-01-21 07:21:53__

> Pros: It checks in everyday to review symptoms. It tells you information about what the rest of the app users symptoms were. It keeps up to date on what it is expected to. Con: I had my mom get Covid, and at the time I lived with her. I couldn't figure out how to report that since I tested negative. Not long after my family finished quarantine, my sister tested positive . I got tested again and was still negative, but technically I was exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:05:20__

> It says my exposure isd turned of but doesn't allow me to turn it on.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:18__

> It would be nice if there was a spot on the daily check in section of the app that had a CURRENT LOST OF SYMPTOMS. Just asking if you're okay or not doesn't help people to realize if they may have symptoms or not.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:21:29__

> this isn't a reflective rating on this app; however, maybe this is proof on how well my VPN is working.. because i don't live in PA. does it even matter that i don't live in PA, if i was wanting to use the app? this raises another concern of mine. my VPN is on all the time, so how could this app, if i did set it up, know where I've been? does it all permission to bypass VPN settings? if not, how would it accurately know where I've been? or have i been mislead on what a VPN does?<br> :date: __2021-01-08 06:20:15__

> Since the last update they took off the daily death count. They only tell you the total death count up to the current date. Because of this the app doesn't exactly tell you the whole situation currently. In begining I actually liked the way app, but since of the many changes that isn't the case anymore.

### Description
> MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.
<br>Your personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How MD COVID Alert works:
<br>When devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Maryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Maryland Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | MDH.MDCOVIDAlert@maryland.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Maryland+Department+of+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Maryland+Department+of+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 


## Mentioned servers

> So far no good because after more than a month of having the app it never showed me a single case of someone near by being positive for Covid19 so this app needs work or be part of another better app...Alone is not working well or is there nobody actually positive for this Pandemic in my area, which I doubt.

> I have android 5 samsung note phone and I could install it. Read the info about the app which explains how it works (without IDg person or phone) and that made it clear that location setting doesnt have to be on. Bluetooth was activated by app; assume i need to have it active when outside the house. Haven't been anywhere yet, so can't really evaluate app properly. But happy to have this app and plenty of free and nearby testing where I live. We can use all the help we can get!<br> :date: __2020-11-11 17:15:01__

> Glad MD was able to get this going. A nationwide alert system would of course be preferable, but the US is obviously not ready for that. Trivial to setup, unobtrusive, and the privacy/security framework seems sound.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:15:46__

### Description
> DC CAN is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the District of Columbia in partnership with the Department of Health (DC Health). The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DC Health.
<br>Your personal use of DC CAN will help anonymously alert DC residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable DC CAN, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How DC CAN Works:
<br>When devices with DC CAN are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the DC CAN app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How DC CAN Protects Your Privacy:
<br>DC Health takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. DC Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for DC CAN to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.

DC Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed Washington's DC CAN app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing DC CAN! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep DC moving forward!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app will work when you get tested by the DC run corona virus testing sites. If you go to private clinic there is no guarantee you will get a verification code if you test positive for covid. The private clinics are supposed to report results to the city health dept but if they don't do that you won't get a call from a contract tracer or a verification code to change your status in the app if you are positive. Go to DC health run testing sites and use this app, and then it works well.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 22:28:01__

> In order to get this app to download, I had to uninstall VA's COVIDWISE app and re-install after the DC CAN app was installed (and then re-enable notifications for both apps once they were both installed). I'm sure this has something to do with androids security permission structure - but it was a little confusing (and I wouldn't have known to do it without reading another user's playstore review).<br> :date: __2020-10-20 18:40:04__

> don't know if it works yet, but Install problem. You need to DISABLE COVID notifications prior to install or it will not allow you to download through play store. This could occur if (like me) you have previously installed another state's COVID app and have enabled COVID notifications.

### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

On the 11th I had to call off from work due to a fever and symptom scare. I did test negative for Covid, but the timing of it all couldn't be worse. I mean, three days, during my wait for answers.

> I am becoming increasingly disappointed with this app. It hasn't checked exposure since January 5th 2021, that's over 5 weeks ago. Seems a pointless app. I have been opening the app almost daily. And yes, it is the latest update according to the app store and it is on the do not sleep list. Even today, Feb 15th, the last exposure check was Jan 5th.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 14:25:51__

> Was good in the beginning when the app first into being, but has gotten slack. On the main page of the app it just has that I was last notified on the 6th January 2021, and has not changed since. Thinking of deleting the app because it seems that you can't trust anyone these days. Sacrificed my 2020 year, and maybe more to come, to take care of my father by myself, no other family or friends and would like to know if I have been exposed. May have to sacrifice my life and go back to work soon.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 03:10:27__

> I had the app for a few months, but I never got a notification. Either COVID didn't exist where I was, or people are not using the app properly. Looking at the other reviews I'm going to go with people aren't using the app properly with no fault of their own.

> You should be able to report if you have been exposed to someone with covid or if you know that you had it without having a test. Example, if a family member had it and you are caring for them and you got sick, you don't need to test the know that it was from covid. That could be different levels of reporting from suspected covid to confirmed if you're worried about false reports. SMH tried to report a known exposure but can't without a test = dumb<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:04:29__

### Description
> CO Exposure Notifications is the official Exposure Notifications app of Colorado and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service. 
<br>CO Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.
<br>By enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you are within 6 feet of someone for at least 10 minutes, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you’ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you to a possible exposure. 
<br>If you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>To learn more, please visit https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications](https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications) |
| **Email** | CO_Exposure_Notifications@state.co.us |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Not sure if it works. Haven't received any notifications after nearly three weeks. There is likely not enough people using this app, and the ones who do use it also use masks and social distancing. It's the ones that don't (use masks, social distance or use this app) you gotta watch out for.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 07:25:48__

> It's helpful<br> :date: __2020-12-07 07:54:07__

> It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:19:46__

> I guess a good app but nobody in my area seems to be using it or posting a positive result in Pueblo County or other counties that I travel to for my job delivering parts, go far as Lamar, west to the San Luis Valley and South to Walsenburg, Trinidad and into New Mexico and you're telling me that I have not been near someone with a positive test result????<br> :date: __2020-12-11 20:39:25__

> Haven't been able to get much info<br> :date: __2020-12-06 18:50:05__

> Called county health department to ask about notification & special code issue. RESULTS: 1) testing agency reports positive tests to the State 2) State notifies counties in which the positive people live 3) w/in 24 hrs, counties notify people who tested positive 4)w/in 48 hrs (cases are mounting),Contact Tracers call infected people & ask w/whom they have been in contact. NO REASON for infected people to need code. Call Labor Dept if there's a work issue. RECOMMEND: call people who know things.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:45:59__

> People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:15:54__

> I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 03:31:37__

> I was in the same house with a person who tested positive... 3 days later... Still no notification! Uninstalling!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 18:55:04__

> Been running into issues of it not checking for possible exposures even with location/Bluetooth being on during the day. Been working around the public and it checked 3 days ago with a hefty amount of keys but not the day after or yesterday for that matter until I found I had to delete all the keys and then it'll restart and start collecting again, all my co workers have it on also. Not a good thing incase I ran into anyone days before that and they tested positive and the keys match later on.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:54:36__

> Positive test here but can't share my result because I don't have a verification code. failed app so far🤷‍♂️ I've searched for about 15min and can only figure it's because my test was conducted out of state. However, I was around people in CO and would like to share it. Will people share if it's not easily available? I would also recommend information about privacy and how your results a reported. People might have a sense of shame or guilt but might share if there's some sense of anonymity.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 01:48:11__

> Confusing app. When you go to notify the app you have covid it prompts you to enter a notification code. But the text message you receive doesn't contain a code, but a link you click on and follow prompts. The text I got after testing positive came 2 days later and was in a spam folder (I didn't know my phone filtered suspected spam). So I kept thinking I didn't have the verification code & contacted CDPHE several times to no avail. They should email the info too & have an FAQ on the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 19:43:17__

> This app doesn't work. I installed it when it first became available. It has never once in all that time reported an exposure regardless of how remote the exposure might be.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 23:39:55__

> The app seems great (simple, unobtrusive, easy to use, no major privacy issues) but what good is the app if people can't easily report their covid results? Why haven't they partnered with testing facilities to provide this code automatically upon getting a positive result? I've had this app for months and haven't gotten a single notification ever<br> :date: __2021-01-10 00:52:39__

> Adventrouous to say the least<br> :date: __2021-01-08 06:45:13__

> The reasonable use of this app doesnt make sense<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:14:51__

> 👌<br> :date: __2020-12-23 09:21:28__

> My wife works with covid patience. So needless to say, she is in contact with covid positive people. Her app says "no contact". Four people I work with have it. Nothing from the app. Broken. 😠Wish it worked better . Merica, thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-21 04:32:43__

> I don't see how this is useful if you don't really know where you got exposed and the date & time. And why not get an alert at the time of the event so an individual can remove themselves. Why doesn't a store owner get an alert so they know someone positive is in the store. It makes no sense that if we are trying to control the spread if this disease that this program doesn't seem a bit more comprehensive. After the fact seems a bit useless. Besides, it sucks battery.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 16:59:11__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use and not much of an imposition to keep it up to date. If it helps reduce the impact of the pandemic it must be worthwhile<br> :date: __2021-02-23 15:41:21__

> Zoe App asks all the relevant and appropriate questions in order to assist the trials and tracking of how we are doing on a daily basis and updating our health situation also on a daily basis including inviting you to have a Covid test and to report the result. The video updates are very good too. A very good app.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:45:25__

> Very easy to use and data helps track Covid 19<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:03:50__

> Helpful to other people to understand any side effects.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 11:54:34__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-23 10:18:46__

> Easy to use but sometimes reminds you to report even if you have already reported.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 08:57:05__

> Ok but you didn't ask for symptoms experienced from the first dose only from the second which I just had this morning. You also don't ask where geographically I received the vaccination or it's relationship to where I live which could give you important information about the relative ease of availability of vaccination related to where one lives; urban vs rural etc. Also you seem to think this is my wife's entry not mine????<br> :date: __2021-02-23 05:08:15__

> Initially it worked well . Then i could not log in,tried many things ,incl password reset,i did get support, but coulnt get it working . Some months later, trying again, i was asked to sign into microsoft email again,and hey presto it worked. I think i was just unlucky. No probs now. Sign up its probably the best tracker in the business! 22.2.2021 Second time failed to be able to report. I think the failure prob dates to the last upgrade. Making the app for me useless. Going to delete and reload<br> :date: __2021-02-22 21:03:49__

> Very quick and easy to use and I feel I am contributing<br> :date: __2021-02-22 14:45:39__

> Too much insistence on daily reporting. I have only taken the Covud tests for surgery<br> :date: __2021-02-22 14:28:13__

> It's not intuitive, sometimes confusing especially between what's the page for vaccine symptoms and daily health.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:48:09__

> Disappointed with wildly varying statistics creating a lack of trust in software<br> :date: __2021-02-21 11:46:37__

> Site sticks occasionally and leaves you hanging in the air. Doesn't offer a ' no change' tickbox.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:13:38__

> Its fine, but I would like to be able to specifically say about how I feel after the vaccine. I am feeling nauseous, but only because I had the vaccine earlier today, and I have had to say that on a section which I believe relates to Covid symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 18:11:49__

> Initially worked really well with a daily reminder to report but the reminder has stopped working since one of the updates. Otherwise it's really easy to use and has a lot of information on the study, symptoms, developments re vaccines that's useful and interesting.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 23:40:20__

> Nice and well developped Covid-19 tracker app. The exposure map in regard with the region is very useful, although it cannot be zoomed in too much and it's difficult to select adjacent regions. Update: Initial Area Map is not updated as it seems, giving false current estimates (for long). UK map displays totally different estimates per area and should be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 22:39:51__

> Didn't recognize my previous PW.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 20:22:51__

> Get, 'Something went wrong, please try again later' each time I try to complete medical questionnaire. UPDATE: Now working ok since update. Daily reminder to enter your health status is good. App lacks ability to state that you know you have had Covid, but haven't had a test. This must apply to tens of thousands who suffered at home or who's symptoms were very mild and where caught off other tested members of same household. If to provide valuable data, surly, this must be included.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 13:25:45__

> Was a bit confusing as I only down loaded app after my 1st vaccine,it would not let me go back to add that I also had a head ache and fuzzy head 20hours in so if others had the same experience your symtoms value may be incorrect or wrong<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:47:59__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 14:25:03__

> Have started to notice the "cases in your area" function does not work anymore. Discrepancies between number of cases and chart details. This number also fluctuates up to 50% on some days.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:58:38__

> Can no longer see the prompt on the vaccine page<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:19:35__

> It stopped working, button stays grayed on screen display vaccine dosage information when one dose recorded and no change, can't hit enter.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:35:06__

> Didn't seem to have an option for being pregnant. I think a lot of my symptoms can be down to pregnancy...<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:14:43__

> I am able to report me and my family's condition regularly. However, the app crashes everytime I select the COVID & Diet "Let's go" button. It also crashes before I can send feedback.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:46:23__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing. Have you even seen this? Why don't you respond to my numerous contacts about this? I entered yesterday. The app says 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:17:00__

> The map makes less sense since they started using cases per million when everywhere else does it per100,000. It also appears data for Wales is at least a fortnight behind.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 01:08:37__

> The app is making a massive contribution to the fight against Covid-19, and on a day-to-day basis it works fine. The downside is that it breaks when it's updated. After the last three updates I've either been unable to login (despite getting a password reset), or the daily notifications have stopped. In all cases the only fix was to uninstall the updated app and reinstall from scratch.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) |
| **Website**  | [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/appvid/mobile/](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/appvid/mobile/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. 
<br>Designed by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. 
<br>In these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>Note that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.
<br>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>This app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
<br>This temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. 
<br>For more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/

> This app does not work for my phone even though It is compatible. I tried to set up receiving the alert through my cell phone it said phone number not available. When I chose the email option I did not receive the email. I then went on line to for help and dialed the number given online and it was the hospital main number. I was then directed to 2 other numbers and no one could help me nor did they know what I was talking about. sincerely, Pauline Mejia<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:39:25__

### Description
> PathCheck (formerly COVID Safe Paths) can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available. 
<br>Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>We are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.
<br>The PathCheck program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck Foundation, established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the PathCheck app and associated tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities. 
<br>The goal of PathCheck is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CareMarket Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.sydneycare.ai](https://www.sydneycare.ai) |
| **Email** | support@sydneycare.ai |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CareMarket+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CareMarket+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This would be better if the doctors were instantly available. There will be hours and hours of waiting and reconnecting and retrying and re-launching the app. I did get to meet with a doctor twice.

> Initial wait to speak with a doctor was 1 hour, which I honestly didn't mind considering the current world events. What really irritated me was the actual chat with the doctor. It took 3.5 hours mostly because the doctor took between 10-15 minutes to respond to me. I believe the longest I waited for him to respond was 30 minutes. On top of all that, I was told he wasn't currently able to provide a doctor's note due to current limitations within the app. Waste of money and time.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:56:02__

> Clunky, confusing setup process. There is a lot of configuration of personal settings even after connecting to the main Sydney health app and my Anthem account. Once you have it set, it still makes you go through the symptom checker before you can use its touted features for communicating with medical experts. Even that might be workable, but there are huge gaps in the symptom checker. I can't start with hypertension or high blood pressure as a symptom? Terrible, frustrating design.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:19:48__

> Think I have Covid but private healthcare is a fail. Horrible App (and somehow I pay for this experience). I have anthem blue cross blue shield and their sydney care app to figure out the covid testing I need with symptoms is a fail. Tries to link accounts but won't login and the reset password doesn't work to the email on file or phone. I can login to their other sydney app just fine. This sydney business has been a wreck since they sought to disconnect it from the name of the provider.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:54:25__

> It will not allow me to get any info over to my work. Will not allow me to download my doctor visit information to my phone or fax it to my work or email to my HR department.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:15:41__

> I have to answer the same questions every time I log in. It doesn't pick up where we left off.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 13:32:00__

> Dumb app does not work!! You can not get passed the login!<br> :date: __2020-09-07 02:37:52__

> App crashes more than all Nascar drivers together. Cant even download an attachment referral. Also have to sign in 8 times just to send one message because it crashes then requires login credentials. Fought with this app for 60 min before I told the doctor to just cancel everything we discussed and I was uninstalling this piece of trash crash app.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 18:39:31__

> Dont download. Cant put in code to register<br> :date: __2020-08-29 17:27:15__

> Keeps going back to main menu, no matter if I try to link it and login with my Sydney health info or try making a new account. There is no in-app chat or trouble shooting. Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this"resource" multiple times. I have a doctorate, and my husband literally writes computer code for a living so this is not user error. If he and I can't figure out how to make it work, it just doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 16:03:30__

> This app sucks I can't even log in...I enter a password and it says my password cannot be my username or part of my username or email even though my password is not!<br> :date: __2020-08-01 01:54:54__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good very informative!<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:39:41__

> I have overall enjoyed my use of D.O.D, however, what needs to be improved upon is the scheduling. There seems to be an issue always when trying to schedule follow-up appointments (at least for me - i.e. no dates available). I don't have time to check the app every day to see if there are openings. Outside of this hiccup, I don't have any other issues with the app. Very convenient.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 05:26:59__

> A big hell ya. No one feels like getting out of PJ's when you feel bad and the Cova Cloud is lerking.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:37:37__

> It's a good option for a lot of more minor problem's. The audio kept breaking up but the weather is horrible and that was a connection issue not Dr..onD. 's fault.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 20:09:58__

> Very helpful! Only downside is you can't contact in between appointments unless you CALL.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 17:31:00__

> Very great app during this time. Just had one issue. It kept making my phone reboot and cutting off the visit. I had to use my tablet for it to work.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 04:47:29__

> Exceptional<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:27:55__

> Thanks I need help<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:14:23__

> Good for when you are in a pinch or rush and can't or don't want to spend hours getting treated. this has been a lifesaver for me and my family a few times now and def would use again.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 23:04:21__

> The doctor was fine, but the audio was atrocious. Turns out you have to manually tell the app to switch to headphones from speaker even with wireless or wired headphones active on your device. I didn't figure this out until the end of the call. That is some backwards technology.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 16:05:41__

> Cannot schedule a future appt unless it's today or tomorrow. When scheduling an appt. The app should auto select the previous physician.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 22:04:11__

> App worked fine but the customer service messaging is absolute horsesh&t. I left 3 messages and waited days for a response. I then called the phone number. I was quickly able to get a real human on the phone who told me I had to wait days for a response. All this was just to replace a 4 day supply of antibiotics I recieved from the Dr. A 4 day supply that was as you can imagine pretty time sensitive as most courses of antibiotics are. So my only other option was to pay another $75 fee.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 20:45:47__

> Money hungry just like all the other docs....gave meds 2 days, weren't working. Called support because there is no way to call the doc you saw. Told me I'd have to pay ANOTHER $75 to get a med change!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-01 17:13:46__

> Everything but choosing a pharmacy worked fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:33:52__

> The doctors are fabulous. However their lack of ability of tec support and processing insurance is not good.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 01:24:14__

> Nice and safe way to check symptoms before going in to ER.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:28:42__

> While I like the convenience of this platform, it is UNACCEPTABLE that I have been cut off at the 15 minute mark, while the doctor is still talking to me! This has been twice! I have no idea what she is going to do and I have no time to ask questions at all! Its my health! I am definitely considering going back to the office, if possible as this is really unethical.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:34:00__

> Filter needs more detail. I cant put location in and other details.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 23:09:42__

> They give me wrong info i ended up having sergey instead<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:20:52__

> Visit was easy and fast but I can't get the prescription they filled for me because my pharmacy said the directions were "unclear" I sent a support message immediately after and I'm still waiting to hear back. I am out of this medication so I hope they can get back to me quickly.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:01:24__

> Doctors are great!! Super nice and always so helpful! Usually never a long wait. But don't ever have any questions to submit to the support team. I have message multiple times with no reply. Literally week 3 of no responses. I need a doctor's note for work, the doctor forgot to send it to me. I reached out January 15 for one, and nothing no responses at all.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:10:21__

> Can't give referrals<br> :date: __2021-02-23 16:37:46__

> I have changes my 5 star review to a 1 star! For urgent care services and to avoid a trip to the emergency room, this app has been great! However, my most recent experiences have not been the same. I have made 3 appointments for therapy services and each time we are prepared waiting for the appointment to start and the appointment drops or is canceled within minutes. Very disappointing!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:23:20__

> Incompetence, telling me they called in my prescription, and they didn't. Connection problems on there part. If I could give a 0., I would. Warning.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 00:42:47__

> They say if you have Medicare you pay 0! I was looking for a counselor not an MD. But what they dont say is, you can't get a counselor for an appointment unless your paying full price with no insurance! I tried with an alternate log in without insurance and could get an appointment right away, but with Medicare I couldn't even get an appointment period!!! This app is a freaking scam! Thanks for the help!<br> :date: __2021-02-17 00:08:01__

> Delete<br> :date: __2021-02-14 03:16:37__

> Horrible doctors that almost always miss diagnose you. Scam don't use it go to the urgent care you will end up going anyways.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:37:38__

> HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE entered data and got TO pharmacy input a nd screen said "no pharmacy" listed Three days later tried and hitting on initial pro.pts for ins,pharm, etc dont work IM TOO SICK AND VERY DONE WITH THIS SLOW DISORGANIZED OUTFIT!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-13 22:13:21__

> Dr.Phil said they take Medicare part b,4 a freedr.appt.they would not do this.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:58:56__

> The doctor is great. Everything else is lousy. Inability to communicate with doctor, tech support is lousy, poor customer service. I wish someone with power to change process and improve software would contact me. Its got a ways to go.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 22:27:22__

> The doctors etc available are great but you cannot contact them if you have questions or need immediate assistance with a prescription they prescribed. Support said they would call within a few hours but it has been days. Edit: reached customer service, they were so inept they forgot what I was talking about and reissued a prescription in error that I know have to call the pharmacy to cancel. They refuse to acknowledge that their automatic reply system is flawed and dangerous. Don't use this app<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:26:32__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:52:12__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Find out what your doctor's not telling you.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:06:55__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> I like the option to add current medications and conditions with the symptom checker, but the majority of my medications and diagnosis don't come up when I write them in the search box so I'm not sure how reliable that feature is, or the app as a whole (though we know it's not meant for a medical diagnosis).<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:25:54__

> This is a decent medical app good for simple medical issues. I found it doesn't work for me having multiple medical issues. It could use a place to enter actual lab results to help with the diagnosis.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 09:03:23__

> Good app but lately crashing alot on my galaxy since January update.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 18:04:03__

> Too many ads<br> :date: __2020-11-16 03:43:46__

> I allow access to my location, it gives me doctors & professions that aren't even close to my area! I put my zip code in & I get nothing! This is ongoing even with updates! Be careful! Stay safe! 😷😷😷😷🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💜💜💜💜<br> :date: __2020-10-27 23:37:12__

> Put in symptoms and it just kept saying I'm diabetic which I'm not but it is does have a lot of info<br> :date: __2020-08-24 06:00:08__

> Cant edit my birthday<br> :date: __2020-08-07 16:48:00__

> Works mostly as expected; although the medication reminder and tracking has trouble with basic math, which makes me question reliability on rest of the app. The medication tracking reliably shows I have taken 100% of my medicine since setting up the reminder; 100% for the month; but only 88% for the week, and each day shows taken. Strangely, 88% = 7/8 of a week; does this mean the app thinks a week has 8 days? And how can I be 100% for the month, yet not reach that level in the current week.<br> :date: __2020-07-27 15:57:52__

> No notifications after 2 weeks uninstall and reinstall not helped had to download another pill reminder app to track my pills instead shame as webmd is a good app<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:04:35__

> The drug interaction checker not working properly. Says it found 2 interactions but only describes 1.Shows it found 3 interactions but only describes 2...and so on.Does not save my drug interaction entries anymore. Have to re-enter everything,each time I want to check something. This started happening with the lastest update..extremely frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:54:00__

> Need to deliver still waiting on my prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-03 01:39:54__

> I used to like the WebMD app before its main screen changed so drastically. It's confusing and not as helpful. Those junk news articles belong in a subcategory, not on the main screen. Not impressed. Please change it back to the old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:18:03__

> This was a great app especially with the symptoms checker but now that feature doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-10-22 15:26:48__

> I've had and trusted the app for years, but about 2 months ago it suddenly started regularly spamming me with notifications with Corona news... Mostly scary and negative stories about people being reinfected, death and about immunization trials being cancelled by johnson and johnson due to safety concerns etc.... WHY ARE YOU SPAMMING ME WITH MORE FEAR MONGERING DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH FEAR IN OUR LIVES!?!? I'm so furious. Sit on my phone and keep quiet until I need you. Notifications disabled<br> :date: __2020-10-15 20:02:53__

> I have found that searching for certain terms, such as "dementia", will get no hits inside the app but will get plenty of hits on the WebMD website. I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:13:12__

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

> Works well. Good list of resourses<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:45:41__

> Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 15:50:58__

> Very practical<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:31:00__

> The app is great and is very convenient specially sens you don't ever go anywhere with out our phones so you always have your id with you this way! I just wish you were able to use it at more places and able to use it to cash checks and wat not but besides those few things it's an amazing idea thanks alot<br> :date: __2021-02-14 06:06:20__

> \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**Update\*\*\*\*\*\** I had to dump all non basic operation apps off my phone to get every thing to process through, but Eureka success! All this app does is collect your data to sell I'm assuming. But it will have you set up an account just to not allow you to log into it after. And when you ask for assistance or request what companies they sell your info to, so you can block their spam, you get generic responses. Assuming these are bots designed to find key words and respond accordingly.<br> :date: __2020-07-30 23:54:34__

> My household moved 5 months ago & 6 of us changed our address online through DMV & followed the instructions to stick a label on the back of our DL's with the new address. However when I scanned the back of my DL today to try to create an account, my information still had my previous address. So this app really won't help me or any of my household members because the address will always be incorrect & cause problems for us in which we will still have to show our actual DL with the sticker.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:24:28__

> Cannot access my account anymore. The account recovery should work. I put in my email address but nothing comes back to reset my password.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 20:29:38__

> So, just renewed my license and while it was easy and the card arrived fast, it was missing the donor heart. I contacted support and they said it was not checked but I 100% did check it as it is really important to me so I made sure. They will not fix it! Really disappointed as the system errored and they will not correct it.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:51:46__

> Everything I upload the front side of my ID it kicks me out and makes me login in again??<br> :date: __2020-09-08 00:43:05__

> Frustrating. Trying to help roommate update his state id. Got to taking pics of id but then it would ask to log in after taking pic of back id. Multiple times. Hes mentally disabled and gets so frustrated that he almost punched a hole through a door window... he has little patience and gets so frustrated easily with almost anything.<br> :date: __2020-06-20 16:55:34__

> Need more documents<br> :date: __2020-05-26 17:43:27__

> 5/17/2020 I came back to the app to see if any functional utility was turned on. Instead all it does is open the website for each issue. I thought this app would provide a list of my vehicles and what the registration status is. How about selecting a vehicle to order a copy of title? I uploaded my license as proof of identity, why?<br> :date: __2020-05-18 00:48:27__

> I'm STILL not sure what the actual use of this is. when i added my ID it said it's not a replacement for the physical ID. also it's been easier to just pull out my ID than login again. at least the one time i was gonna use it i just gave up because i didn't have time to go through the verification process every time.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 23:55:02__

> Sweet, I need a registration renewal and everything is closed. So I see on Nextdoor about this app. But I can't use it - why? I have a 2 yr old $150 Lenovo Phab which won't allow this app. So I need to buy a new phone to use - great. Not everyone can afford a new phone every year especially Seniors. The emissions places are closed as are the DL locations so I guess I just drive with an expired tag.<br> :date: __2020-04-22 20:23:52__

> I dont like the registration processes seems like a traker, n I dont trust it.<br> :date: __2020-04-21 03:11:37__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | support@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=American+Well](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=American+Well) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pretty straightforward. Make sure to have a good wifi connection. Unfortunately where I live, we don't have great internet.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:30:33__

> Questions after ER Muscle spasms, severe pain, numbness.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:10:21__

> The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 21:04:16__

> I had sprained my ankle really bad and I didn't think I needed to go to a hospital and risk getting Covid. The doctor was great very informative and answered all my questions. The downside is the app has a section for emailing your doctor and the one I selected did not receive them. That information should of been on the description of the doctor. I also needed a doctors note she said she'd get it but forgot. Contacted support multiple times till after almost 2 days I got my doctors note.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 00:53:59__

> Dr responded at midnite. Ordered antibiotics. Able to avoid ER or acute care to possibly be exposed to Covid-19.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 05:54:30__

> Always updating, frequently have trouble with app, video connection pretty poor.<br> :date: __2020-03-22 15:54:59__

> I'm sorry I only gave you a three but when I am promised paperwork on a Friday and don't get it there's something wrong you got what you wanted from me but yet I don't get anything from you I know it's busy but I need my paperwork that's all I'm saying You're a little slow getting paperwork to your patients or your emails I wish your daughters were a little more reliable when it comes to sending paperwork<br> :date: __2020-03-16 04:33:01__

> not happy Dr never called me back my whole head was swollen and I needed antibiotics for an abscessed tooth didn't get them<br> :date: __2020-03-05 19:02:19__

> I have been having a great experience with both the app and Amwell services. It has been a god-send for me for many reasons. I am very grateful my insurance has teamed up with Amwell. However, as time went on I discovered the billing dept really sucks! I had appts scheduled and when I logged in I found that I suddenly had to pay for the visit out of my pocket, but my insurance covers it 100%. I was expected to pay for it and be reimbursed by my insurance. Like I have $80 just sitting around.<br> :date: __2019-11-13 14:10:22__

> Need to use it more. It's a good starting point.<br> :date: __2019-10-25 18:44:01__

> Its good but every tine i log in it makes me reenter my cridit card number.<br> :date: __2019-09-20 01:59:16__

> The look of the app is almost exactly the same as LiveHealth Online Mobile. Has WAY more insurance providers... But still can't find anywhere that will accept Pan America Life insurance. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2019-08-15 04:50:44__

> Disappointed off the bat. was sent an email from uhc to click and register to get an amazon gift card for registering. nada. its a good idea for doctors... help people out by making it cheaper and more accessible during the times of day when people actually get sick. so 3 stars.<br> :date: __2019-05-25 22:29:37__

> The app and service is great, as long as you're paying. I didn't need to continue using the service so I canceled after talking to the doctor and getting the help I needed. However, the pharmacy didn't get my prescription order, and Amwell support refuses to give it to me unless I start my membership again. That seems shady to me. I paid for a service and received it, but didn't get to retrieve the solution (prescription), which was the reason I signed up in the first place.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:19:05__

> Basically an app to purchase a doctors note for work or school. The doctors or nurse practitioners seem terrified to write any prescription that isn't OTC. I deleted it.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 17:44:50__

> So frustrating to use. Never works right and I get over charged.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 22:35:46__

> The service is a great idea and fast. But the app will not allow pictures to be uploaded forcing a video visit. Once they get that fixed, it will be great.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 15:18:06__

> Video of my doctor was not good, nor was the audio with the doctor, we resorted to a phone call for the audio portion. I have been using " Doxy me " for other doctor visits and it works much better.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 19:12:11__

> Not the biggest fan, my insurance wasn't found but the company was listed.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 17:23:27__

> Waited with 11 people ahead of me, only to get to the front, wait another half hour, and then be transferred to someone else, only to be pushed back in the queue even more. When I got to the front of that person's queue, after 15 minutes the app forcefully logged me out! I feel terrible and this was 4.5 hours of my time wasted! Not cool! I really need to see someone.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 03:24:08__

> First visit for my son went great. Doctor was friendly and listened and helpful. Second visit was for me. The doctor couldn't even work his camera correctly so all you could see was the top of his head. He then was very condescending. He didn't even know about one of the medications I was taking (it's used off label for my treatment). He kept insisting it's never used for that I must take it for something else. 🙄 You can't go back to file a complaint.<br> :date: __2020-01-24 11:24:41__

> Don't be surprised that the app doesn't work just when you need it. Today is Sunday and just when I need it, it is not working. Not very 24/7.<br> :date: __2020-01-13 06:46:21__

> Like with all these apps. "Go to a doctor or clinic" I understand to be seen in person. Best bet is to not waste your time and spend more money<br> :date: __2019-11-28 00:51:01__

> Uninstalled immediately after the signup page. I am a trans person who came across their services recommended as being LGBTQ+ friendly but the app has a signup form with no options for gender other than male/female, and no option for a social name. This tells me everything I need to know about how I might be treated. Terrible.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 17:43:38__

> This app is going downhill. Tried to submit an appointment and there were no available slots until December 16, 2021. I then tried to message their "digital receptionist” in the app to confirm if that was accurate and got an error saying the message couldn't be sent. Makes the app pretty useless as I can't wait 11 months to see a doctor.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 20:54:26__

> It was working fine for the first time..then all the sudden it start acting up for me<br> :date: __2020-11-22 01:20:40__

> Last Time I tried to Tele Visit a doctor. He was extremely rude and unprofessional<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:10:58__

> Not worth my time. Called for a uti, described my symptoms, mentioned several times that these are the symptoms I ALWAYS get for uti's. Doctor prescribed antifungal, and said if I get flulike symptoms, to go see someone in person. Really, wait until I have flulike symptoms to get appropriate treatment? During a pandemic? Thanks for nothing, jerk.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 03:06:24__

> Thanks for letting me spend $70 for a 10 minute visit for a doctor to tell me I need to see a doctor in person. Super (un)helpful Also I've been waiting to be reimbursed for two visits that happened in August and September. I sent the proof from my insurance that I should be reimbursed but it's been stuck in the billing department for over 4 weeks.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 20:00:28__

> Not very comprehensive. Nothing for chronic pain of any type.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 18:53:20__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Indiana University Health |
| **Website**  | [http://iuhealth.org/videovisitsapp/](http://iuhealth.org/videovisitsapp/) |
| **Email** | webmaster@iuhealth.org |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Indiana+University+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Indiana+University+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Tech said the app should "just work" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone.

> I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:06:13__

### Description
> Take 30 seconds every day to fight COVID-19. Your daily health check-ins help doctors and scientists anticipate the next outbreak and get ahead of the coronavirus. The first time you download the app and share how you feel, we’ll donate a meal to people in need through Feeding America.
<br>The How We Feel app only asks you to self-report age, gender, postal code and any health symptoms you’re experiencing. It does not ask you to sign in with your name, phone number or email address. The data is securely shared with select scientists, doctors and public health professionals who are actively working to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>The How We Feel app was built by an independent, nonprofit organization called The How We Feel Project. Our organization was founded by a volunteer team of scientists, public health researchers and technologists. Our mission is to make the world healthier by connecting citizens with the global health and research community. The organization was created in March, 2020 to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>We are proud to be working with scientists, doctors and public health professionals from leading institutions including McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
<br>We are collaborating with Dr. Gary King from Harvard University’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science’s Privacy Insights Project. Dr. King specializes in developing technologies to make data available to researchers while protecting participants’ individual identities.
<br>Our technology team includes Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest and a volunteer group of current and former Pinterest employees.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | The How We Feel Project, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.howwefeel.org](https://www.howwefeel.org) |
| **Email** | info@howwefeel.org |
| **Physical address**  | [949 Bridge Rd San Leandro, CA 94577](https://www.google.com/maps/search/949%20Bridge%20Rd%20San%20Leandro,%20CA%2094577) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+How+We+Feel+Project,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is a tool to gauge the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Provides info on state level, then compares the state & national statistics. App gives you a feel for how other states are coping. Provides links to the CDC website & other medical centers. If you dig deep enough, you can find the impact on your county. Finding granular data isn't straightforward. There's a lot of info out there if you care to find it. Info can be found by going straight to CDC.gov. I like this app. Recommended.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 23:46:24__

### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>Monthly membership (when you’re not using insurance). $45 for the first visit, then after you will have access to 24/7 virtual doctor visits for just $10 per month.
<br>Pay-per-visit (when you’re using insurance). Costs vary based on insurance copay and deductible. Many plans cover 100%!
<br>Unlike other on-demand providers, HealthTap connects you with a doctor via text or video in less than one minute--not hours or even the next day. We also don’t require you to answer a bunch of questions in advance. You can see a doctor immediately.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>Note that certain medications including controlled substances must be prescribed by a specialist or with an in-person visit, and cannot be ordered by HealthTap doctors or any other on-demand provider.
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>1. ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>2. SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>3. ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.
<br>What people are saying:
<br>PC Magazine - "The next time you have a medical question… try asking the doctors on HealthTap."
<br>*Virtual doctor visits currently not available for people in Alaska and Idaho
<br>Copyright © 2020 HealthTap, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
<br>HealthTap may not be available in certain states and is subject to state regulations. HealthTap does not replace the primary care physician, is not an insurance product, and may not be able to substitute for traditional in-person care in every case or for every condition.
<br>HealthTap does not guarantee patients will receive a prescription, does not prescribe DEA controlled substances and may not prescribe non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> As much as I like this service since it keeps me from needing to go to a 
doctor's office, it needs work. I have done two consults now as a Prime 
member. My prescriptions were not actually called in on either one, 
resulting in extra time and visits needed at my pharmacies.<br> :date: __2018-08-03 15:34:35__

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:05:40__

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable. Just be aware that the free service could have you waiting quite a while for any responses. You might be better off with other services.<br> :date: __2019-10-03 13:28:51__

been going through hell. Thanks HealthTap for changing services on people 
who now can't get their meds.<br> :date: __2018-08-10 19:23:24__

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

> Wouldn't let me add or update. I kept trying but it would not work.  Plus it kept asking me to upgrade to add money.<br> :date: __2016-03-23 15:29:33__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gundersen Health System |
| **Website**  | [http://www.gundersenhealth.org/](http://www.gundersenhealth.org/) |
| **Email** | gldevelopmentservices@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quick easy, and far less time than going to the emergency room...this time. : )<br> :date: __2020-06-06 17:51:57__

> Very easy to use. I had called the Hospital and with COVID-19 I did not have to leave my house. I will use this again. It beats waiting at urgent care, having to drive in, and they send meds if needed. Ea as y to upload pictures and the Dr. can view with your phone camera to examine the area.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 08:15:24__

> Exceptional, easy to use<br> :date: __2020-04-22 03:41:22__

> During this time of uncertainty, my virtual visit was awesome!! I had a nice clear connection with my provider who was great. She was able to look at my chart during our visit all while I was comfortably at home<br> :date: __2020-04-15 21:44:35__

> My provider was great! Everything went smooth and she was very understanding and helpful! I appreciate this app SO MUCH with having 3 SMALL kids at home this was the way to go! Thank you!<br> :date: __2020-03-22 18:57:40__

> Incredibly convenient. It just saved me an hour drive and untold time sitting in urgent care just to have a care provider take a peek at me. I'm a believer after just one e-visit. If it's something that a high resolution photo and a brief description of symptoms could handle this is the ticket. Doctor was very through and set appropriate expectations. Also you get to pick from a list of available doctors and you are able to review their basic credentials on there biography page. Mind blown...<br> :date: __2020-01-21 23:46:25__

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It isn't very consistent. Constantly goes in and out. Very irritating when you are trying to talk and listen to your child's doctor and its all messed up.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 20:18:13__

> Functional but not nearly as good of video image and sound connection as a simple Zoom, Google Plus, or WhatsApp. Better than nothing. We were required to use this by our healthcare provider, and it really compromise the ability to communicate during a very important visit.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 16:24:34__

> They used to be good but now they are absolutely a waste of time, all they do now is tell you to visit their office to have the child seen. Hello!! We don't feel safe taking our kids into an urgent care right now. What's the point of this app if you no longer do anything.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 00:36:36__

> Lagging. Voice going in and out. Not able to hear what the other person saying. Screen freezing.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:07:11__

> After waiting almost 45 minutes, the app kicked me out of the waiting, and I had to request a new visit because the Doctor I chose was unavailable. I waited almost two hours, when there were only 2 patients ahead of me. I ended up cancelling the visit because I got tired of waiting online. Not worth it!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 04:13:51__

> Worst Experience Ever! Only once the app has worked for us, rest multiple times it just fails. It says "connecting doctors video" but than fails and says your appointment is canceled. One day we were on hold for 4.5 hours, first it failed call the customer service they reset the appointment, than we waited and the doctor transferred to another doctor and post that failed again. Our friends us CHOP and have never faced such issues.Not sure if its the app or Nemours practices. Will not recommend<br> :date: __2020-07-25 16:52:37__

> Pediatric? Only adult options were listed<br> :date: __2020-07-19 01:15:40__

> Very frusterating. Stayed on the phone for hour just to have the Dr hang up on me due to no connection and i would have full barns on WIFI sitting right next to the box. For days i have been trying to get this to work. And everytime i call the office they just direct me back to this app. On the me help u and it never works. Cant even get my kid seen. Very pissed off mom<br> :date: __2020-07-17 22:37:56__

> The Clermont location is terrible. The staff is incompetent and rude. They do not care about the babies and only want to push products on you without listening to your concerns or needs. Do not go to Nemours in Clermont FL!!! You will be very unhappy!!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 22:39:04__

> My toddler fell outside and cut open his eyebrow. I did not want to go to the urgent care or ER and expose us to c- virus, so I tried the care connect app for urgent care. We were 11th in line waiting. After over an hour and a half of waiting we were still 3rd in line so I left the app running and pulled up my camera to get a new photo of the injury. I switched back over to the app, to see the doctor had declined seeing us. It would've been nice if the app had some type of way to alert you.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 00:06:50__

> Would give zero stars if I could. It says online that they treat ear infections, so I booked an appointment. She has an ear pain and a fever. They said she doesnt have an ear infection and even if she did they wouldn't treat her. That means I just wasted $60. Don't waste your time. Go to a real doctor. I know my doctor would've treated her infection because she's my 4th child and I've been through this many times. I'm so upset! This is what I get for trying to take shortcuts!<br> :date: __2020-03-26 23:36:46__

> Absolutely useless waited 1hr for the doctor to log off and the system to kick me out and make me start all over.........I could wait till morning and see my primary faster<br> :date: __2020-03-25 03:04:17__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | HEALTH PLAN OF NEVADA, INC. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider!

> This app is terrible. I didnt used to have problems with it but the last 2 times have been a nightmare. The doctors werent able to connect, 1 had to call me and for the other the app stated that my appointment had finished even though it never connected me to the doctor.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:33:48__

> Worst app that I have ever used. It can't connect properly to my insurance on every visit and their personnel don't seem to actually know how to fix the situation each time that I have tried to use it. Also, the damn thing will suddenly kick you off of the appointment while you're waiting once you give up on getting a free appointment and pay for it. Don't use this unless they fix their massive problems. This thing is a mess!<br> :date: __2020-12-06 17:44:15__

> Didn't cancel appointment I canceled, cannot maneuver to find covid test results, but liked my physician on 3/31<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:55:38__

> No longer connects well. Since the update it says you are connected, waiting for the physician to connect...then it doesn't connect and the doctor cancels<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:04:15__

> Always technical issues. I have the newer smart phone and I pay for the internet. It always kicks me out.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 16:50:39__

> I waited for the doctor, the app said "you have connected and are waiting for the doctor to connect". After about a minute, another message that said "The doctor cancelled the call".<br> :date: __2020-07-02 12:39:26__

> Couldn't even connect<br> :date: __2020-07-01 23:41:53__

> Why, oh why...when I do my initial login, after the app sends me an email verification code, does the app kick me back to the initial login screen when I switch my phone screen to said email to obtain said verification code, thereby invalidating the aforementioned verification code? When I put my credentials back in, I am sent a new verification code. Rinse, lather...repeat... Will I ever be able to login without requiring a secondary device just to check my email???<br> :date: __2020-04-04 03:09:35__

| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> life saver<br> :date: __2020-10-26 10:37:41__

> I had my first visit on May 10 2020. The doctor was fabulous. I just needed an asthma inhaler refill. Walgreens pharmacy said the script didn't list generic as acceptable. Put shortly, it was resolved. However, the inhalers were recalled a few months later. I came back to Express Care to explain I needed a new script. Others need returned. Again, doc was great. What upsets me is getting charged $55. I paid for 2 visits & 4 inhalers unnecessarily. Disappointed<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:10:48__

> Had to re enter things a couple times. I hear they're working on it.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 00:49:25__

> Positive once the bugs were worked out.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 16:22:28__

> The doctor was good. The issue I have is if you take too long inputting information after you choose a provider, it will kick you off and say that the provider is no longer available and you have to start over again.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 21:44:07__

> I had connection issues a couple minutes after the appointment started. I disconnected and tried to reconnect, but the app wouldn't let me do that. I ended up just doing the appointment over a phone call, much simpler and more reliable that way.  It's also annoying that it makes you fill out payment info and other forms right when you're supposed to have your appointment, instead of letting you do that in advance.<br> :date: __2017-09-02 05:19:50__

> Can't really rate them high when I get get the ap to work and there is ZERO technical support. I've tried to sign up twice and filled in all my info and it just says "checking insurance info" and spins. Then after several minutes it asks me to log in and when I do it says "my password or username is wrong". Ive done it twice. It didn't work. Too cheap to have a support phone number so screw them.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 22:06:10__

> Slow<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:25:56__

> I tried 3 times to use this, every time when it got to the video it just stopped loading. Total wate of time when I was really sick and needed to see a Dr. That was after it froze numerous times on the beginning screen. I had to reinstall twice and log back in, even call the customer service to reset my password moments after I'd been logged in and it kicked me out.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:45:30__

> Tried to connect 4 times. The app told me I was connected but was waiting for the provider. My appt was cancelled 4 times by the provider. Every time I tried remaking the appointment I had to wait in line, so clearly the problem wasn't with the provider's connection. This app was a giant waste of 1.5 hours of my day.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 21:04:51__

> I can't even open the app anymore. It just crashes outright.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 20:57:21__

> It didn't work the first 3 times because of the video connection. Then made connection video started to work and went out, audio only...only choice was to reconnect and lose my place in line again. Poor app wasted a lot of my valuable time.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 23:16:46__

> MY INFORMATION IS CORRECT!! YET I STILL CAN'T LOG IN!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 04:21:33__

> Terrible. Can't even get set up. Have tried numerous times, just keeps looking for my insurance info...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 21:16:01__

> Terrible! Just awful. You have to reenter everything if you go off the app! The number for help doesn't work! The damn thing doesn't lists all insurance! It's just awful! Worst thing to happen to Cleveland Clinic since parking down town!<br> :date: __2020-08-02 18:46:04__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I downloaded this app based on my employers advice because it's supposed to be a free service for us. I've had nothing but issues. The registration process was not simple and I was told I had to pay $82 for a consultation. I called and spent 30 mins on the phone with someone who told me that was a glitch and she gave me a credit. Today I'm told via email I'm not covered and I owe $82. This is not convenient and poor customer service.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:26:02__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> Severe issues with progressing after selecting options. Was only able to proceed after moving back a page and then moving forward. The blue arrow in the lower left page woulf either be grayed out or it woulf be blue wouldn't react. Long loading between screens. Health profile wouldn't load and had to move back a page and go forward numerous times to get it to populate. Not phone or connection based issued as everything else works.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 21:07:37__

> The app works, but is frustrating. It continually says I have a message waiting but there is no message to read. I made an appointment, PAID, and then doctor never showed. So now what? I paid and got no service.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:22:16__

> Great experience, would definitely use again. It was convenient and very easy to use. Update: Used again and was extremely disappointed. The doctor never looked and my pictures that I had sent. Also I wanted a video call, instead the doctor called me on the phone, he was driving and like I said he never looked at my pictures because he asked me to describe my rash. Without looking at my pictures he went ahead and diagnosed me even after I told him I already had the prescription he prescribed it<br> :date: __2020-12-01 17:20:58__

> Nice idea, not done in a good way. Started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago & around 2 weeks after, I couldn't message her on their system. Last week, I couldn't confirm an appt., I called support. They did nothing. They said they would escalate it, and I never heard anything back. When I mentioned the message problem, they didn't acknowledge it. I had to message them again to see what was going on. Turns out it was something my therapist needed to do on her end, they didn't even know.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 00:57:38__

> Had to set up my first visit 5 times. Crashed anr would not let me move on from particular fields. Seemed to get stuck trying to add primary provider. Audio on first call was choppy. My wife has used before on hers and up till recent had not noted similar issue. Could have been network rather than app<br> :date: __2020-09-04 17:22:25__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Bronson Healthcare Group |
| **Website**  | [http://Bronsonhealth.com](http://Bronsonhealth.com) |
| **Email** | bronsonhealthcaregroup@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [601 John St. Box H Kalamazoo, MI 49007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/601%20John%20St.%20Box%20H%20Kalamazoo,%20MI%2049007) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bcbsm.com](http://www.bcbsm.com) |
| **Email** | mbryson@bcbsm.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Blue+Cross+and+Blue+Shield+of+Michigan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Blue+Cross+and+Blue+Shield+of+Michigan) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

They overdrew my account once doing this. Not worth the hassle. Can't afford all that every month. I've been having really bad problems with anxiety and this was the best option for me.

> Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | University of Missouri |
| **Website**  | [https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits](https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits) |
| **Email** | mudoitappsdevsupport@missouri.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Division of IT 615 Locust St, Columbia, MO 65211](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Division%20of%20IT%20615%20Locust%20St,%20Columbia,%20MO%2065211) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

> I set up a doctor appointment for my sleep, waited 16 minutes in the waiting room after the set appointment time, only to be told that he's unavailable. I would rate him but so far I'm unable to find his information or even asked why he's declined to see me as a patient today. So far this app has been the worse to appointments, I'm giving it one more chance with a therapist to see if it's any better this round.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 20:40:24__

> Good doctor, hard to hear at times but overall great experience in short matter of time.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 15:34:50__

> My first time to use this company app was good and well use again .<br> :date: __2021-01-21 02:52:06__

> Easy to use. Wish there was a place where I could keep notes for myself on whatever was discussed<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:48:29__

> My only concern is I can not figure how to raise the volume to hear the physician. Other than that I highly recommend this app. The doctors are always pleasant and they listen so they can diagnose. I am grateful to use this option even in the wee hours of the morning.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 00:08:44__

> Fast and professional<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:51:16__

> 1st time to use app. Worked great and had a good Dr. Will use again<br> :date: __2020-12-20 01:18:11__

> Very convenient and helpful. Doesn't take the place of in person though where tests can be run. Great to be able to talk to a professional about what's ailing you.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 19:45:38__

> First time using app. First time I did an appointment, the doctor had to cancel due to technical issues. I wasnt charged for it. The second time I was able to get ahold of a doctor and she was very nice. Recommend if you are unable to make a same day appointment with doctor.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:10:06__

> Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 03:17:22__

> I didn't like it the doctor was kind of rushing through it it was a waste of time & money<br> :date: __2020-10-07 20:32:24__

> Was not able to connect virtually. Also no where to see notes on your visit.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 18:16:06__

> The video call portion does not work. Even the provider told me to use a computer and the website because the Android app never works right. Good provider, terrible app.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:42:43__

> I had a good experience with this I was impressed with it, real simple, easy after I stared at for a minute but I'm not good with this internet stuff. I just wish they had a psychiatrist a doctor of psychology. I need a therapist as well as a doctor, I'm in need of medicine & need to vent a well.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 19:00:33__

> I'm pleased with the doctors available but the app has given me an issue with the audio each time I've used it. Is there a patch available?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 00:37:19__

> Not great at all. Took three tries to get through. I can't message the Dr. I talked to and I don't think the prescription was called in. Awful experience! It is fixed now after calling the company. They had to call in the script. Been on the phone most of the day.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 21:53:32__

> Pharmacy search didn't work first time. Time out too short. After logging in again, had to repeat same questions, but pharmacy search worked.<br> :date: __2020-04-11 20:48:29__

> Great app when it connects, have experienced issues with that despite having fast internet with no issues.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 15:30:45__

> I need a number to contact. I talked with a doctor on this app today, Wednesday March 25th. He told me I would receive an email or a message on the app from him saying we spoke and he diagnoses for me. I never recieved anything! I needed a doctor's note as well as information to show my primary care physician. Please is there a number to call to find out why I have not received this information yet?<br> :date: __2020-03-26 01:42:11__

> App was useful for a couple of months but it hasn't had available providers for months now. I scheduled an appt with a doctor a month in advance and was cancelled with no notice the day of. Useless and demeaning.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 05:16:50__

> In theory it seems good I'm having a difficult time finding any doctors. Very little appointment??<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:10:08__

> Haven't used much yet. Can't see the option for answers down below.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:30:10__

> App is very frustrating. Filled out my information and accidentally put in my credit card instead of my HSA card. I immediately cancelled and later, I received an email from my CC company stating my credit card was charged. I had to start over entering all my my information along with my son's ailments. I selected to see the first Dr. available. The app said someone would be with me soon. No estimate on how much time so I am sitting staring at my phone thinking soon would be 5 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 04:23:36__

> Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 22:45:22__

> The visit went well however i need a prior auth for an eye medication for my eyes it has been since September 2nd and it is now sept 5th and i have absolutely nothing for my eye so it went from " allergy pink eye" to full blown pink eye in my right eye i cannot contact the doctor nor can i send her a message i paid 58 dollars to see this doctor and now i have to waste time going to an urgent care just a suggestion check insurance to make sure a prior auth is not needed b 4 prescribing a med.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 22:30:20__

> I really wish it was easier to schedule an appointment with my same therapist. There should be an option to schedule my next appointment when I've finished my session. It's frustrating to have to pick dates and find my therapist's name<br> :date: __2020-08-22 14:46:16__

> Trying to see a doctor all day but the system won't verify my insurance. It wants me to pay full price then wait for reimbursement. Customer service was no help. Just told me there was no ETA to have the system running correctly. Just told me to keep trying back. Poor form LiveHealth.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 23:39:36__

> I have full covrage insurance and they tryed to tell me they cant find my provider... And all information i did twice just to be sure it was not messed up i dont have the money and nore should i pay for it when i have insurance..<br> :date: __2020-06-20 17:20:03__

> The video portion kept freezing and then halfway through my session it cut the audio down so low that I could barely hear the person on the other end. I'm really disappointed that I had to end my session all because your application could not keep the audio up.<br> :date: __2020-06-15 22:41:13__

> Will not respond to refill requests causing you to not only have your treatment delayed, but also to pay an additional $60 for an appointment. I have tried at least 8 times with multiple providers.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:41:05__

> It is not worth it.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 02:20:19__

Customer service said they'd "open a ticket for me" so I am left waiting to be able to see a dr until they're tech system is fixed for something that should be completely routine, like updating a credit card.

### Description
> 98point6 provides on-demand diagnosis, treatment and consultation from board-certified physicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy—all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get the right care at the right time. No appointments, no travel. We’re available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. 
<br>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
<br>There are two ways to get 98point6: via a Personal Plan or a Sponsored Plan.
<br>Personal Plans subscriptions come at an introductory rate of $30 for the first 3 months, with unlimited access to on-demand care for just $1 per visit. When that initial period ends, you have the option to enroll in an annual plan for only $120 per year + $1 per visit. (Please note, only one patient per account. You must be 18+ to create an account and seek care; 19+ in Nebraska.)
<br>Some employers, health plans and retailers provide access to 98point6 at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your plan sponsor.
<br>WHAT DOES MY PERSONAL PLAN SUBSCRIPTION COVER?
<br>Your 98point6 Personal Plan provides you access to our board-certified physicians who offer consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Insurance is not required for your visits. Patients are responsible for any outside-of-app costs, including prescriptions, labs and visits to an in-person physician, if referred. 
<br>WHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS?
<br>Our virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected, board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible and affordable. They are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (98point6 supports photo, video and audio as needed.)
<br>WHAT CAN YOU TREAT? 
<br>Our board-certified physicians are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when it matters, guide you towards the most appropriate next steps. If your issue does require in-person care, you can be sure you’re on the right path to feeling better after consulting with a 98point6 physician. 
<br> 
<br>Common conditions we treat include:
<br>• Cold, cough and flu
<br>• Urinary tract infections (UTI)
<br>• Acid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues
<br>• Yeast infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
<br>• Muscle sprains and strains
<br>• Seasonal allergies, asthma and respiratory issues
<br>• Skin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn
<br>• Women’s health, such as birth control 
<br>• Nausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis 
<br>• General health questions
<br>• ...and more
<br> 
<br>WHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? 
<br>Our doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications. However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what’s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. 
<br> 
<br>Note: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | 98point6 Inc. |
| **Website**  | [https://www.98point6.com](https://www.98point6.com) |
| **Email** | support@98point6.com |
| **Physical address**  | [701 5th Ave, Ste 2300 Seattle, WA 98104](https://www.google.com/maps/search/701%205th%20Ave,%20Ste%202300%20Seattle,%20WA%2098104) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=98point6+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=98point6+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I love being able to discuss symptoms with a Dr and they can help me with figuring out home remedies or if we need a trip to a Dr in person. I feel very confident in the advice they give me. It's a free service through my insurance and I really appreciate it!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:24:23__

> Excellent, excellent, excellent. I am so thankful my employer has allowed this service thru my health plan. I have used for me and my 3 year old. I have always received great advice. As well as having medication called to pharmacy from a UTI to a sinus infection for myself. I highly recommend. Especially during covid no need to expose yourself unnecessarily in a MD office.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:13:14__

> Dont like that u cant talk to the doctor only by text<br> :date: __2021-02-13 00:33:46__

> Very quick and helpful<br> :date: __2021-02-09 15:58:34__

> I had throbbing aches to the back of my right side of my head and times to my neck and tight shoulders to realize it could be a muscle strain.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 01:16:08__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-01-05 11:50:15__

> Prompt and helpful and i didn't have to leave home.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 07:56:30__

> Very easy to use and got a quick response from a doctor about my wrist pain. She was able to diagnose the issue and recommend next steps.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 02:13:02__

> DR Was friendly and clear.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 00:01:37__

> I've used this app 2x and have found both to be beneficial. Questions were personalized and I was able to provide pictures. Really simple to use.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 16:09:55__

> Quick and easy all without leaving my couch!<br> :date: __2020-10-03 15:33:12__

> Provides a pretty quick and detailed appointment. Questions vet you so a doctor is more prepared, and they can schedule lab work and tests from within the app. Of course, since this is digital, they are extra cautious of all symptoms, but I've used this three times with good results.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 16:30:09__

> Takes a while to actually communicate with a real doctor, and then of course its still just texting, no voice, which I don't like. But I appreciated getting a doctor's opinion on a covid matter.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 00:55:56__

> Decided to give app a shot. Got connected to a doctor. She did not listen, listed my symptoms completely wrong, and wrong diagnosis. Since this time, I have spoken with management, not customer service. They listened to the issues and will hopefully correct them. It is a fairly new app, with time there may be improvement.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 23:39:39__

> Very thorough<br> :date: __2020-08-10 14:03:47__

> Useless if you need a dr for children. At this time its only for adults. Which they didnt tell me until AFTER i paid for a subscription and started speaking with a dr<br> :date: __2020-04-19 22:11:02__

> Completely useless. Three attempts, three disconnected sessions, no resolution of any kind, an hour of wasted time. Edit... increasing to three stars due to customer service response phone call. App still needs work.<br> :date: __2020-04-15 18:57:13__

> Chat based telehealth has a lot of potential, and the app worked fine, but the doctor barely said anything. He didn't tell me his diagnosis, just said "I think we can treat this with strong topical antibiotics", and confirmed my pharmacy. I had to ask him what he was prescribing. He responded with 1 word (the medicine name), and them ended the chat - didn't tell me how to use it or how long it would take to heal or ask if I had any other questions, etc. Left me with little confidence.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 20:56:16__

> Interface is not user friendly. But, with persistence you can manage it. I made a mistake filling out the create account form, my birthday was wrong. However, the form pointed me to my name, which it allowed me two tries and then I had to uninstall to get more attempts to get the information correct. I could understand a password. I have yet to use it to see a doctor. I hope that experience is better.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:41:33__

> Not helpful and slow<br> :date: __2020-03-26 22:26:44__

> Used this app previously and it worked great now it keeps asking me to set up a profile but not giving me a way to advance. No way to contact tech support anywhere in the app. Great concept now let's get the bugs out.<br> :date: __2020-03-08 07:33:57__

> I don't know what.<br> :date: __2018-06-11 03:22:11__

> Great concept but a real cra\*\*y app. I have insurance. The only questions asked have nothing to do with anything other than basic personal info. You got next and theb told your not covered. $120? I don't think so. Some of us are on social security<br> :date: __2020-08-14 14:02:12__

> Didn't like it<br> :date: __2020-08-12 20:17:58__

> Some doctors know what they are doing and actually get to the point. Others happen to treat you like a box to be checked off regardless of whether or not you receive correct treatment. But most commonly, doctors treat you like you're faking to be sick just to talk to nab a prescription. In my case, I have 2 ear infections, a sinus infection, and acute tonsilitis. I'm motion sick, nauseous, my head is heavy, I have varying fevers, etc and they won't give me antibiotics. A local clinic covered me.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 03:36:11__

> The app is great concept, meaning you dont have to get up to see a doctor as you can speak to a doctor right on your phone. The reason why I purchase the app was for that reason. My Bartholin Gland was very swollen and I was in severe pain, too painful to get up. I spoke to a doctor who told me to go to the ER. I didn't want to go to the ER considering the circumstance that at this time there is a COVID19 epidemic and I didn't want to be selfish to occupy a room when someone else needs. No meds<br> :date: __2020-07-05 21:15:22__

> Computer questions redundant, did not correctly respond. Example: I said no cough, it kept asking about my cough. Today I attempted follow-up, but did not get notification when Dr. available. Dr. ended chat one minute before I checked again.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 19:22:01__

> Same rigid and dogma, same low efficiency with other doctors, but good attitude. This is why American average lives are less than Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 00:21:52__

> No way to password protect. Anyone can view medical information which is a hippa violation. Please update app with fingerprint and pin options to protect privacy. Then I will raise back to 5 stars as I do like the app.<br> :date: __2019-03-16 02:01:47__

> I have a health coverage from my ex employer the treasure dept<br> :date: __2018-10-06 22:07:38__

> This is supposed to be text-based. I logged in to try and get care for a simple issue. I got as far as entering my name and phone number before the on-screen guidance asked if a video chat was ok. The options were Yes or End Visit. This is a bogus program.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 21:56:16__

> Want a covid test done before they do anything. Its a joke.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 23:08:44__

> The Dr's on here don't listen and definately won't prescribe medicine. I clearly had an URI and they said to just rest and take allergy medicine. Went to my Dr and they immediately prescribed an antibiotic. Similar experience prior. This is a joke and GIANT waste of time!!<br> :date: __2021-01-16 03:11:42__

> No alerts after wsiting sn hour for an MD then disconnected!<br> :date: __2021-01-06 02:40:51__

> Not being notified when doctor is available<br> :date: __2021-01-05 05:44:30__

> Waste of time, just go to a real Doctor.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 02:26:43__

> The first time i used this app was great...after that it was useless.. The drs didnt want to do anything to help me and suggested i go to a dr... I have no insurance and my normal dr is a low income clinic that takes months to get an appt at... And i cant afford an er visit each time i need a medication refilled... And it wasnt even a narcotic medication or anything along those lines... So whats the point of this app??<br> :date: __2020-12-21 12:48:01__

> Terrible. No one to help with technical issues and no number to call.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:44:52__

> Horrible!!! Unable to register. Pages keep rotating.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 18:02:56__

> Useless. I have used the app three times. Each time the result was a big fat nothing. Each time i then went to Urgent care , around $140-$150, and was told I have a sinus infection and was subscribed an anti-biotic. I thought the hole point was to forgo the office visit and use these physicians.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 19:40:12__

### Description
> iBlueButton has been designed to specifically serve Medicare beneficiaries, Veterans, Americans covered by HUMANA, the Military and their family covered by TRICARE and those receiving care from the nearly 400 healthcare systems and thousands of physician offices iBlueButton supports. With iBlueButton, you have in your hands at all times your medical information to better manage your healthcare, avoid preventable medical errors, and receive safer and more effective care. 
<br>iBlueButton won the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button® program, to give Americans the ability to access their Blue Button health records. iBlueButton was the first native mobile application approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Americans covered by Medicare to make use their Medicare Blue Button data to receive safer healthcare. iBlueButton is also one of only four applications approved by the VA for Veterans to access their VA health records and has been partner of the VA since 2011, and in 2021 iBlueButton was the first mobile application approved by Humana.
<br>For Medicare and Humana beneficiaries along with their approved caregivers, iBlueButton lets you login into your account at MyMedicare.gov or Humana and retrieve your medical history. Your health information is automatically translated on your phone or tablet from your Medicare or Humana claim  information into an organized medical history in all of its useful details. 
<br>When accessing VA or your other healthcare provider health records, iBlueButton additionally displays your lab results in organized lab panels with indication of normal ranges and graphs so that you can see lab value trends overtime. To get more information for each laboratory test, iBlueButton provides one-tap look ups through Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of Medicine. 
<br>- ALL IN YOUR HANDS
<br>iBlueButton pulls and organizes multiple records into a single Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections (medications, conditions, laboratory test results, etc.) and your detailed medical history (physician visits, hospitalizations, etc.). This Summary Record is available at all times to review, research, share, print and annotate critical health information. iBlueButton’s on device architecture fosters privacy and security and allows for data to be accessible even if you are not connected to the Internet.
<br>- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS
<br>Whether it is about the medications you currently take, a new one recently prescribed, an existing condition, or new medical condition iBlueButton automatically generates safety warnings and best care practices based on well-established guidelines. iBlueButton now also offers COVID-19 related alerts, including an alert if you are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, and an alert about eligibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
<br>- LIFE AND COST SAVING
<br>On average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians and most of the time any one of these physicians will not have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel and their families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place not only in VA and military health facilities, but also in the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.
<br>- SECURE AND PRIVATE
<br>Unlike most personal health applications, iBlueButton stores your information securely encrypted on your own mobile device. Under your sole control, your personal health information is retrieved by your app from the data source and goes directly on your mobile device where it is securely stored. None of your personal data is processed or stored in the cloud or seen by Humetrix.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Humetrix, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ibluebutton.com/](http://www.ibluebutton.com/) |
| **Email** | ibb.support@humetrix.com |
| **Physical address**  | [1310 Camino Del Mar, Suite C Del Mar, CA 92014](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1310%20Camino%20Del%20Mar,%20Suite%20C%20Del%20Mar,%20CA%2092014) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Humetrix,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 20:03:58__

> Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:31:01__

> My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 00:29:47__

> Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at "higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:33:49__

> I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:29:37__

> Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:14:19__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2019-10-15 01:10:34__

> Great app to organize your medical information found on the Medicare website in Manage your Health.<br> :date: __2019-10-04 21:19:10__

> After using iBlueButton for a couple of months I noticed it was not updating my information.  The Humetrix support team was friendly, responsive, and pro-active in addressing the issues I had with the app.  As I reported issues they fixed them promptly and genuinely seemed to appreciate my input.  IBlueButton is a useful app with the best customer support I've seen in years.<br> :date: __2019-09-28 00:31:00__

> Using this app I found not one but two pretty huge errors in the information a doctor provided to Medicare, including a medication condition I never had. Recommend.<br> :date: __2019-09-24 18:09:46__

> A QUICK and EASY Document review system for multiplatform Care Providers. My only link is : " My Health e Vet " and it allows Documented & Statistical Data Review without need to allow entry to my actual secure site.

> Tried it since it was updated just yesterday (wanting to stay away from old junk). It won't retain the portal information, at least for VA.  I'd put it on and save but it would erase it and all again.  I used the same info to log on to actual site with no problems.  Maybe VA has changed their portal access or something.  I am a MHV coordinator so I'd love for this to work.  Update...working perfect now!<br> :date: __2014-07-22 20:47:53__

### Description
> Now, board-certified health care providers can care for you or your child wherever you are, whenever you need them, from the convenience of your own mobile device or computer. From coughs and sore throats, to minor skin irritations and joint pain – we have you covered. An easier way to access both adult and pediatric care teams for urgent clinical care needs and common concerns – on your schedule, and in about 10 minutes!
<br>Your virtual visit may even be less expensive than your other care options, compared to urgent care clinics and emergency rooms.
<br>Simply download the app and register, and then select a provider and ‘click.’
<br>Once you select a provider, the online communication begins shortly thereafter! Telehealth providers accessed via the Penn State Health OnDemand app will diagnose, may suggest follow-up care, and can prescribe medication.
<br>Healthcare that meets you where you are and at your convenience; helping you feel better and return to your life sooner.
<br>Penn State Health OnDemand can be used for various common symptoms and concerns:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cough
<br>• Eye infections
<br>• Joint pain or strains
<br>• Lower back pain
<br>• Minor rashes and skin concerns
<br>• Painful urination
<br>• Sore throat
<br>• Stuffy and runny nose
<br> 
<br>The Penn State Health OnDemand telehealth program is not be appropriate for all concerns. The following symptoms should not be treated by a telehealth provider; go to the closest emergency room for in-person care:
<br>• Assault, physical or sexual abuse, or child abuse
<br>• Changes in mental status or confusion
<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Coughing/vomiting blood
<br>• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Penn State Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.pennstatehealth.org](http://www.pennstatehealth.org) |
| **Email** | innovate@pennstatehealth.psu.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Penn State Health 500 University Dr MCH162 Hershey, PA 17033](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Penn%20State%20Health%20500%20University%20Dr%20MCH162%20Hershey,%20PA%2017033) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Make sure nothing else is connected to your phone via Bluetooth BEFORE you start the visit or you won't be able to hear the doctor very well! This has happened a few times and once the volume of the other person is low there is nothing more you can do so the doctor gets a lovely view of my ear on the camera because I am trying to hear them! It is really hard for me to remember to shut off my Bluetooth before I go into the app and this has been a big disappointment using the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 20:29:15__

Also, they say Corona screening 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., but the day I checked every nurse was offline. This app can be useful for quick first Care service, however.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 18:42:33__

> I had a virtual visit scheduled today for my son. The doctor was unable to see our video feed on either of our phones even though we allowed access to the camera. We had to complete the exam over Zoom after several unsuccessful attempts to get this application to work. Other than this issue, it seems like a nice app with lots of potential. We tried the app on two different Galaxy S20+ phones.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 03:12:03__

### Description
> Coalition is a global, privacy by design, contact tracing app to stop the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Coalition App alerts you if you have crossed paths or spent time with another user showing symptoms, or those who have tested positive for the virus.
<br>Instead of using your location data, Coalition uses secured bluetooth to protect your privacy.  Your information stays anonymous and private, and isn't shared with anyone without your permission.
<br>Only when you confirm that you are sick, does Coalition share an anonymous ID with others who you have come into contact with.
<br>We believe that citizens can help fight pandemics without giving up their privacy, Coalition is the first step to a pandemic free future.


### User interface

> It's a shame more people aren't downloading this app! It's also a problem when I search Google play store for COVID-19 apps and they only show 2 apps that aren't even for my area. I appreciate you and your team for helping with the issue 🙏<br> :date: __2020-07-29 18:18:00__

> I like the level of privacy assured and I recommended it on NextDoor. But I have a question. As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron 👍<br> :date: __2020-04-25 02:24:34__

Privacy isn't much of a concern to you or your company. I definitly came to the right conclusion about this app. I saw your previous reply before you deleted it. I'm just a user.

### Description
> The Intermountain Connect Care app allows you or your child to visit with an Intermountain Healthcare clinician for certain urgent care conditions using your phone or tablet.  If you have cold or flu symptoms, sinus pain, sore throat, painful urination, a minor rash or skin issue, upset stomach, or other minor symptoms, use Connect Care 24/7/365 to quickly and conveniently get the care you need from wherever you are – just $59 a visit.  Some insurance plans accepted.
<br>Connect Care is a convenient, affordable way to get care from Intermountain clinicians. Our highly-trained, board certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants have many years of experience in urgent care, clinics, and hospitals, and are specially trained to provide care using telehealth. Your doctor will also be able to see the results of that visit in your medical record, and can incorporate it into your overall care. Depending on the issue at hand, the provider can diagnose, suggest follow up, and prescribe medication, when appropriate.
<br>Connect Care is not appropriate for all conditions. If you are unsure of whether you are having a life-threatening medical emergency, or are experiencing any of the following, please go to your nearest ER:
<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Uncontrolled bleeding
<br>• Sudden or severe pain
<br>• Coughing / vomiting blood
<br>• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
<br>• Sudden dizziness, weakness, change in vision, slurred speech, numbness, or other neurological changes
<br>• Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea
<br>• Changes in mental status, such as confusion
<br>• Assault, physical or sexual abuse, or child abuse
<br>Additional information about the Connect Care service can be found here: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/urgent-care/connect-care/

> The absolute best doctors visit I have ever had. Easy to set up, easy to schedule, easy to chat and explain my symptoms. Instead of the minimum 1 Hr. Round trip (realistically 2 Hr.) To the office to be told the same thing from login to logout was 12 minutes! You do not have to be tech savvy to use this it walks you right through the steps and don't worry if you don't have a computer or laptop you can use your smart phone . Rest assured it's an absolute delightful experience.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 23:30:56__

> The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 19:00:53__

> Easy<br> :date: __2020-06-11 22:11:42__

> Saved me a trip to an urgentcare where they would do multiple tests to diagnose me with something that I already knew I had. Love love this app however they did not have my insurance listed.

> Risky, the PA I got said that it didnt look like an allergic reaction and said to go to insta care. I did and the provider said I was an allergic reaction. 59 dollars to 173<br> :date: __2020-12-07 19:36:44__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-09-22 13:54:52__

> A bit confusing<br> :date: __2020-05-07 05:50:32__

> Choppy interface/ lag<br> :date: __2020-05-04 22:22:35__

> The PA I saw was great, but the app seemed to have issues working properly. I could see my doctor, and I could see my video was being captured by my device, but he had trouble seeing me multiple times during the visit. I know my wifi signal is strong because I used it to work from home today. Not sure what the problem was. However, I did really, really appreciate not having to wait in a doctor's office during COVID-19. I'll continue to use the service again and see if the app works next time.<br> :date: __2020-04-09 16:39:30__

> It kept telling me that it needed more access to my phone, even when I granted all access.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:54:27__

> Kind of confusing how to set up the app<br> :date: __2020-03-26 17:05:42__

> I wasn't too impressed. The wait times were comparable to instacare, but at least I didn't have to sit in a waiting room full of sick people for 3 hours. The lady tried to prescribe me amoxicillin when I had marked that I was allergic to penicillin so I know she didn't even look over my file. Works in a pinch though.<br> :date: __2020-03-18 05:43:31__

> Not do happy with some things<br> :date: __2021-01-26 03:57:34__

> I was next to see someone 6 times and got booted back to the beginning, had to reenter my info, and wasted 45 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:38:49__

> I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice.

This needs lots of work!<br> :date: __2020-08-13 23:10:26__

> Every time I call it has problems connecting. It doesn't matter what wifi I am using or if im not using wifi at all. And I've also had connections with my doctors drop and had to recall and pay twice just to be seen.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 04:41:31__

> Couldn't see the others person<br> :date: __2020-06-29 22:28:45__

> The NP's and PA's are the most unhelpful and rude health professionals I've ever spoken with, and I am in healthcare. They jump to conclusions and give misinformation ( adults can't get thrush??). EDIT. The app was fine. That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.<br> :date: __2020-06-13 21:52:25__

> Messages stopped working on app and online! I keep getting an error when all fields filled in.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 20:11:04__

> Update: 2 hours of down time now. I'm trying to see a decent doctor for a misdiagnosis from Dr. Tyler D'Hulst about my hand. He said tendonitis but it's turned into a bulge in my tendon and it feels like it split and latched onto an adjacent tendon in my hand. My middle and ring finger on my dominant hand will not move independently anymore 24/7/365 is a lie I've been trying to get on for an hour and it just says they're "upgrading my experience". I don't see downtime as an upgraded experience!<br> :date: __2021-01-16 10:02:42__

> Why there is no summary or report of the appointment? The appointment was okay, the Dr. said she was gonna send in a request for OTC meds to my pharmacy, got there to pick it up, but of course it wasn't there and they had no idea and since it is OTC just go and pick it up. But what?! No details were given by the Dr about the type of meds and there is no record of it anywhere in the app. So basically the only way yo find out is to have another appointment for another $40....<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:15:45__

> It wouldn't accept passwords from two different accounts. Connected to internet too.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 07:29:04__

> This app is garbage and so is the desktop version. I've been waiting an hour and a half and it just keeps glitching and kicking me out of my spot in line. It gave the option to connect with the provider by phone call instead, so I hit that option and still nothing. No call. No video appointment. Nothing. Guess I'll get dressed and have my hubby take me to the instacare instead. I better not get billed for this.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 21:43:07__

> Third appointment on connect care third time that the app will not work.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 17:26:00__

> Installed just to check a covid test result. I see no way of doing that. The only thing I see is how to make an appointment. What a waste if time.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 16:35:27__

> This app i not user friendly I have typed in my information +5 times correctly, then stating your unsure it is who I say I am.. I know you guys are slammed but honestly please do something. I've waited on the phone with tech support on regards of my Account info for over 40 minutes. Then I got annoyed and hung up. Called again and once again still on the phone for more than 20 minutes. The auto record states you will only be waiting for 20 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:55:53__

> I waited two hours to be seen, and kept getting canceled on each time I got to my turn on the waitlist. Four different times. I hate leaving negative reviews, but this experience was awful and extremely frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-09-15 20:56:55__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | UW Medicine |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UW+Medicine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UW+Medicine) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was routed into this after calling a UW primary care. Initial experience was okay. Then tried to reconnect after a couple of weeks. Waited in queue for 3 days only to be dumped out after hours of waiting each day. Do the Drs. know how many patients are in their queue? When they quit, patients just seem to get cut off. On third day app tried to transfer me to a different Dr. but just cycled endlessly. Seems like Drs. can't finish their queues rationally.<br> :date: __2020-03-20 22:59:46__

> unable to open app.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 23:44:38__

> This app can't be used. It always say we're upgrading your experience.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 21:03:56__

> The clinic is a rip-off. The Doctors are subcontractors who can't help you with anything UW and just read you Mayo Clinic sparknotes. They couldn't answer anything about Covid-19 testing/screening even though they list th at as a feature in the app. It's a waste of $35 dollars and is practically fraud considering how they rush your meeting while dodging every question as "They Don't Know". Worse yet I called the UW Helpline and they falsely claimed that this was nessasary for appointments now.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 19:15:10__

> Could not locate my record..??<br> :date: __2020-05-27 18:23:44__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. Don't be deceived because it says UW Medicine! The UW has partnered with American Well(Amwell) in Boston and they run this clinic. Saw a virtual "DR" who was worthless for 3/4 minutes. He ordered a prescription for me but never transmitted to pharmacy. Amwell even "double dipped" into my bank account also. Beware, beware, beware of this app and don't use. It's not UW Drs that you get to see! Update: UW is cutting ties with Amwell on June 30, 2020. Yay!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 23:08:01__

> I had all the symptoms for covid except feverish temperature. Since it was difficult to get an appt at the dr. I decided to use the app to get checked, i was on the wait line for a good hr till my phone screen turned off. I opened my phone again, the app had refreshed so i had to register my patient info, symptoms,etc again. I was 31st person on the wait list, my screen timed out again and this happened another 2-3 times over 5hrs till i just gave up.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:03:39__

> Does not function, forced to rely on an app that spits me out of the queue. AWFUL.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 00:00:32__

> When I was signing up, I didn't know that there is a word limit so I tried to abbreviate and by the time I press continue, it says, my time expired so I started again. Then I started waiting under Dr Rueda at 11:47 am and by 1:23 pm I received a message that the Dr is no longer available. What? Why? Patients are in pain why the added pain. Have mercy<br> :date: __2020-03-23 22:03:39__

> It is 0 stars. I have waited for over 5 hours in their virtual waiting room, for a doctor that at some point got offline and they did not notify me. Great concept. Doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-03-19 18:25:18__

> Garbage. Waited for more than two hours with a sick kid, got bounced around to different providers before finally getting to the front of the line and the doctor was no longer available. This is not stable enough to be in production.<br> :date: __2020-03-16 05:51:51__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

After getting the card approved finally, was able to connect with doctor after two attempts. Dr was bear personable and asked all the right questions. Was a good experience. My theory is that the data connection needs to be at a high connection speed as this app uses a lot of data. On Verizon here so usually isn't an issue.<br> :date: __2019-12-31 18:13:56__

> Absolutely atrocious. You want to have a system not collect your insurance properly and overbill you? This is the one! Sat on the phone with customer service and was transferred 5 times. Nobody was able to help me get ahold of who I needed in order to get the money I needed back during these times. Instead I was told to try and call back next week because my account may have been created. Even though my appointment was already a week ago.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 20:53:40__

> Very expensive. My copays is usually only $10.00.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:23:36__

> Everyone situation is different. If anything happens outside of the patient or doctors control be aware that you may have to pay for the visit like I did. I reached out to customer service about the situation and after 2 weeks I was told I still had to pay when clear communication with the doctor showed that the app was the fault. So be aware if you have a problem you may be still have to pay which isn't right.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 20:49:42__

> I had Covid19 in july 2020. I was atended 3 times, by 2 doctors. They prescribed antibiotics and fever-pain medicine. My point is, I told both doctors I was 2 weeks with fever, not getting better, but they kept saying I "eventually would be better". After 2 weeks, I started feeling short of breathness, when standing up. I decided go hospital. There, in half hour, they found 2 lungs compromised by pneumonia, and imediatelly started antibiotics. In 4 days I was back home.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:24:41__

> Doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-12-02 15:47:44__

> Was charged twice for their services. An authorization hold then an actual charge. Ended up paying an over draft fee because of being charged twice. Was not WARNED..that I would have TWO charges on my account. Sad because I needed help but ended up paying more than agreed on.<br> :date: __2020-07-20 15:15:39__

> Called a healthcare provider for an absess on my jaw, she couldn't hardly hear but go ahead and cancel my session and bill me 60 dollars for nothing. But I can call back and get charged another 60 dollars I'm sure of that.<br> :date: __2020-03-30 15:03:39__

I recommend this instead of going to a walk in doctor or your regular provider. During the coronavirus . I know people are scared to go to the doctor right now. This app allows you to see a doctor and not put yourself or your family in jeopardy. I'd give 10 stars or more if that was possible.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City Practice Group of New York, LLC |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | aftercare@citymd.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__

| **Website**  | [https://www.therapeuticsmd.com](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com) |
| **Email** | amiller@therapeuticsmd.com |
| **Physical address**  | [951 Yamato Road Suite 220, Boca Raton, FL 33431](https://www.google.com/maps/search/951%20Yamato%20Road%20Suite%20220,%20Boca%20Raton,%20FL%2033431) (Google Maps) |

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Heal |
| **Website**  | [https://www.heal.com](https://www.heal.com) |
| **Email** | developer@heal.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great service, app can be a bit annoying, but it's full of useful information<br> :date: __2020-07-20 22:40:40__

> Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.<br> :date: __2018-10-01 01:48:41__

> Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5<br> :date: __2018-09-28 06:26:18__

> The app works great for scheduling and getting regular updates, but I wish 
I could access the care plans from within the app, rather than needing to 
go to the website; it makes me question why I should use the app over the 
website.<br> :date: __2018-05-04 18:36:50__

> Thought I would give it a try and was pleased. Showed up early in their window. Noted they claim they work with Cogna but not sure. For me the convenience was well worth the extra price over sitting in some ready center. Will use this service again.<br> :date: __2018-03-06 22:59:40__

> Great app, I needed the flu shot asap the doc showed up gave me the shot all done with in 10 minutes. I will definitely be using the heal app again.<br> :date: __2018-02-19 18:00:59__

> I enjoy talking with the doctor<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:47:50__

> There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:49:22__

> Waiting patiently for HEAL to come to my area in Florida!<br> :date: __2019-10-29 03:29:26__

> My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2018-12-04 20:06:26__

> When entering birthday, a required field, the only method is using the pop up calendar which defaults to today's date and only let's you go back one month at a time, so if you are 30 years old, you need to tap the back arrow at least 360 times to get to your birthday, really? Why not allow someone to just type it in?? No healthy person would want to do this let alone a sick person. Terrible UI design.<br> :date: __2017-11-25 07:58:07__

> There is no services in the Las Vegas,  NV valley @ all.  We need the doctor sevices here.  We have to wait 2 to 3 months to get in for appointments.  It is a shame or waiting in line @ Urgent care for 2 or 3 hours..<br> :date: __2016-11-01 21:15:32__

> There are multiple issues with this app. 1. There needs to be a visual timestamp. Especially in chat. It's obvious as to why it's not there, but it would and should be displayed ethically. 2. There should be a way to set an audible notification, as I have no idea until I look again, whether or not my chat has been answered.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:36:42__

> This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...<br> :date: __2019-08-20 22:15:47__

> The app has not allowed me to select a date for appointments for two months. It freezes and I have to close the app entirely, then call anyway to make my appointments. The frustration compounds when appointments are cancelled and I have to repeat the process.<br> :date: __2019-07-18 03:08:25__

> Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the "schedule a service" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?<br> :date: __2018-12-05 18:14:31__

> The service is terrific but the app is no longer working well. I have to use the website rather than the app to schedule my appointments.<br> :date: __2018-09-23 18:26:18__

> Live in Walnut Creek. One side of the street has service, other side doesn't. Mind blown!<br> :date: __2018-01-13 20:25:11__

> I'm trying to use it because I am sick but it won't let me save any of my information on it on the profile everytime I hit the save button it just spins a circle like it saving but then if I go back out of it because it does nothing afterwards it just cleared everything out and nothing gets saved so I really never got to use the app at all<br> :date: __2017-09-12 18:56:17__

> App doesn't work.  Actually needed it last week and it failed.  Wound up going to the local urgent care instead.  Waste of time to even use it...<br> :date: __2017-04-27 20:41:02__

Telehealth through Blue CareOnDemand is also safe and secure, with your privacy as our priority. Your visit with a Blue CareOnDemand doctor complies with HIPAA. Your entire telemedicine visit and credit card transaction is secure, and your personal information is protected. 
<br>URGENT CARE
<br>Don’t wait until a doctor’s office is open or can “fit you in.” Choose the time and place that works for you. Use Blue CareOnDemand for many of the same reasons that would normally send you to a clinic or doctor’s office — but without the hassles of travel time, crowded waiting rooms and restrictive office hours:

<br>· Cough
<br>· Flu, cold
<br>· Bronchitis
<br>· Sinus infection
<br>· Respiratory infection
<br>· Urinary tract infection
<br>· Vomiting, diarrhea
<br>· Stomach ache
<br>· Pinkeye
<br>· Sprains and strains
<br>· Headache
<br>Blue CareOnDemand doctors will access your symptoms using live video and audio chat. These virtual office visits allow the doctor to interact with you to diagnose your illness or injury, suggest follow-up and even prescribe medicine, when appropriate.
<br>HIGH PRAISE, HIGH QUALITY
<br>Blue CareOnDemand uses a platform created by doctors that was named the most popular consumer telehealth app worldwide in 2014, according to App Annie, and the first telehealth service awarded accreditation by The American Telemedicine Association.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I have had numerous problems with getting the prescriptions prescribed during my and my husband's visits. I was on hold with the prescription health line for 50 mins, with an expected wait time 55 mins when it changed my wait time 65 additional minutes! I had to check in to the app and see another doctor, paying more money to get my prescription sent to the right pharmacy.

> I will say upfront, this will totally depend on provider, but using this app can be a total waste of your time and $59. You may find a provider who is dismissive and you may end up at an actual doctor's office, as I did. There is no follow-up mechanism, so once you pay for that visit, you are on your own...sick or not.<br> :date: __2018-01-27 16:09:04__

This details their spoken languages, state licensure, board certifications, professional affiliations, clinical interests and education. You will be asked to provide medical history for the patient, indicate what pharmacy you use and pay your $10 copayment for the visit.
<br>Talk to a doctor – Within minutes, the doctor you have chosen reviews your medical history and your virtual visit begins. The doctor will discuss the issue with you, answer your questions and recommend next steps. If a prescription is medically necessary, it will be submitted to a local pharmacy of your choice. The average visit length is 10 minutes.
<br>After the visit – Clinical notes about the visit will be available on your account for sharing with your primary care provider or for your records. Any prescription or sick slip written may also be found there.
<br>Your NALCHBP Telehealth account is also available online at www.nalchbptelehealth.org or by calling 888-541-7706.
<br>Get the urgent care services your family needs, wherever you are, with the NALCHBP Telehealth app.
<br>Your privacy is taken very seriously. An NALCHBP Telehealth visit is secure and HIPAA compliant. This site is intended for NALC Health Benefit Plan High Option members only. Services are separate from your PPO provider network. If you are not an NALCHBP member, you will be responsible for the full cost of any services you receive from our urgent care practice.
<br>Please note that telehealth is not for emergencies. If you’re having a medical emergency, call 911.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Horizon Corporation |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Horizon+Corporation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Horizon+Corporation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> COVIDaware MN is the official exposure notification app of the State of Minnesota. With the COVIDaware MN app, your phone gets notified when you may have been exposed to COVID-19. The app is built with privacy-preserving Exposure Notification technology developed by Apple and Google in partnership with the nonprofit PathCheck Foundation. COVIDaware MN exchanges anonymous Bluetooth keys with other app users when you are within 6 feet of each other for more than 15 minutes. If an app user reports they tested positive for COVID-19, the phones they exchanged keys with are anonymously notified. The notifications let Minnesotans know when they should take extra care and get tested. Nobody ever knows your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you.
<br>COVIDaware MN is made available by the State of Minnesota to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Like wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands, it adds another layer to our defense against the virus. No single layer is completely effective by itself, but when used together, they make us all safer. The app is part of a comprehensive contact tracing initiative managed by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). If you test positive for COVID-19, an MDH contact investigator will provide a test verification code you enter into the COVIDaware MN app. After you enter the verification code, other app users will be anonymously notified that they were near someone who has recently tested positive. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been carefully inspected by privacy and security experts. For complete information, visit https://covidawaremn.com.
<br>Help us slow the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota by sharing COVIDaware MN with your friends and family. Let’s be COVID aware, MN!

> Edit: the below issue has been addressed. Much better now! Old review: "Like the app, easy to use, pleasant interface. However, I was exposed about a month ago. It alerted me correctly, but it never cleared/updated the exposure notice. It says "Possible exposure 7-14 days ago". So after your first possible exposure, you'll be tempted to ignore it. It would be more effective if it either said "Possible exposure between "11/14 and 11/21" or simply added a timestamp to each exposure notification."<br> :date: __2021-01-13 15:17:30__

> Great if you live in MN<br> :date: __2021-02-15 00:36:46__

> This app was making my phone battery drain significantly faster than usual. Uninstalled it and sure enough, I'm back to having plenty of charge left at the end of the day. Also, I'm not sure how useful it was, when it only reports exposures of 15+ minutes, in a world with highly contagious mutations and aerosols lingering after people have moved on. Good idea, but since I'm being extra-careful, I'm uninstalling and having my phone battery function normally.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 18:18:46__

> Not as useful as I thought it would be.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 08:36:50__

> App is simple to use. Haven't been exposed so not sure if it's working. But a new bug has emerged. It's no longer updating my exposure checks. The notification stays active and can't be dismissed. I am uninstalling until it can be fixed. Don't feel like seeing a constant notification but isn't actually checking my exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 14:40:41__

> Broken! The checking exposure notification doesn't ever go away. This is completely unacceptable as it will cause people to delete the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 06:56:40__

> Virus control<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:06:45__

> So far, I can't tell, but tomorrow I go to hospital. I expect it will go off like crazy there. Not sure what the range is...6'? 20'? For airborne virus, 6' is no where near enough distance. I surmized that in January 2020, based on YouTube reports of medical analyst Dr. John Campbell. Check his channel out.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 19:44:24__

> This app was totally amazing, it was sending my Meta Data all over the world. It even showed me that my neighbor was exposing him self to Covid with a un-natural hand sanitizer pump that doubles as an omelette maker. Keep up the good work. It's a winner for me.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 04:18:23__

> Every time this app does a check for exposures, it adds a file in my downloads. One day alone had 40 checks/40 files downloaded. These are a waste of space. Otherwise, i like the theory of this app, hopefully more people download it so it can actually do its job.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 02:51:26__

> So what is a verification code and how do you get one and from whom? A help function or more explanation is needed.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 02:33:56__

> This app gives very vague information about potential exposure. It caused me to be quarantined for exposure to a neighbor whom I rarely ever see. That placed me closer to that neighbor than I normally would be. After testing negative on the 6th day, I decided to remove the app from my phone.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 14:08:36__

> Downloads multiples files every day, there is no settings I have limited data and there is no download with confirmation to see if we want to wait on the updates. It's downloads showing in notifications bar. This behavior is not acceptable to me...as I have Limited data each month. Give us the option to download these files for the app when we are ina Wi-Fi spot..I don't want to use my cellular data all the time, give us the ability to stop auto downloads till we get to wifi spot. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-02-04 04:32:02__

> Gives a notification for 'checking exposures' that doesn't go away and you can't dismiss the notification. Would like to have the app, but I don't want it if it has this annoying bug.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 17:25:50__

> don't know but bluetooth bad for me<br> :date: __2021-01-13 15:40:34__

> I didn't find the app useful as it only searched to see if I was around anyone exposed while I was alone at home. Not helpful!!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:02:06__

> So I got a positive test; the app REFUSES my code saying that theres an error or that something went wrong i deleted the app; redownloaded it; cleared the cache and nothing works but the MDH wanted me to download the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 02:19:23__

> Very poorly engineered. The fact that there is only one notification category is a problem in-and-of itself. That my downloads list is full of exposure check files is another. Other reviews complain about requiring completely new setup every time a needed service is disabled and re-enabled. Overall, the functionality is important, but I cannot endorse the engineering effort here.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:37:47__

> I think this app is fine. However I live in a boarder area MN WI, and WI also has a tracking app. I can only use one at a time, not both. For me this is a problem. Isn't there a way you can create them to work at the same time and give people like me better coverage?<br> :date: __2020-12-26 13:51:11__

> Verification code is not work.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 06:19:01__

> Marketing the launch, this listing, and info via the app itself could use improvements. User is instructed most explicitly in receiving notifications, and not the other major function - reporting. Please include in how-to and link in more places to the FAQ where this entire part is even touched on. Why does the app say "Verify your diagnosis"? You literally already have your diagnosis from your doctor. Why not "send" or "report"? Thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-18 01:21:17__

> These people have no idea what they're talking about. One mask, two masks, a thousand masks, it doesn't matter. This is all to justify the destruction of our way of life.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 12:11:59__

> Checking every minute and popping up too many messages that it is checking exposures since I rebooted my phone. No way to adjust.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 06:14:13__

> In the last hour I've had 60 push notifications saying "checking exposures". I've had to disable notifications for this app on my phone, so what's the point of the app if I have to disabled notifications?<br> :date: __2021-02-19 22:49:38__

> Seems like a great idea, but It sends a push notification everytime it checks to see if your exposed, without any way of changing it to only alert if potentially exposed. It just went off at 4am and all it was doing was checking, which isn't cool. Also, you actually have to add your test results. I've been around several people who tested positive and the app said nothing. Maybe the app should be required for covid tests, and the results should be sent through it so the app actually works.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 10:50:49__

> Just showed up but I Didn't download this. Don't want it.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 22:41:59__

> I need to my ciy<br> :date: __2021-02-08 18:33:12__

> I think this ap was a good idea but it is wasnt letting me know when i come in contact with a infected person. I know lots of people who had covid and not once did this ap alert me. It seems people who got covid never used the ap to let other people know they have it. Great idea with the ap, just people just dont give a darn to let people knowthey are infected. Sorry i deleted this ap. Maybe when they can figure out how to get people to use it when they are possitive of covid and then i will use<br> :date: __2021-02-06 16:46:49__

> Always buzzing, and very disturbing<br> :date: __2021-02-06 02:11:23__

> App doesn't work. I have received 7 different verification codes and called MDH about a dozen times now. None of the codes worked. I have tried on two different phones, but I haven't ever got it to work on either. I have zero confidence that this app actually does anything at all.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 20:11:44__

> It's an app that will track YOU even when it's off. Supreme Court ruled that they cannot track you without a Search Warrant. This popped up on my new phone...unrequested!<br> :date: __2021-01-28 06:07:15__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

It seemed as though every time she looked at something else on her computer the visit froze. Very annoying. We both kept having to repeat. The visit therefore probably took longer because of this.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centura Health Colorado |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | scottraymondcentura@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centura+Health+Colorado](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centura+Health+Colorado) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Always good to visit with the doctor. I like the fact he try's to keep me accountable. I also like that he don't think a pill is the cure all, he always has a natural healthier alternative. Thanks doctor will talk again in a month.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:04:46__

> It was great! It's very difficult for me to get out, especially in the snow, so this made seeing my healthcare provider much easier.

> I believe you have a very good interface and navigation. THE MAIN ISSUE: I did not understand that another app needed to be downloaded. My assumption in designing these types of umbrella apps in my career is how to inform the users. From device, operating systems, connections, infor. required, all these moving parts integrated to keep the end user's from feelings of failure, duplication, last min. changes. I did a study the amount of time a consumer will stand in front of an ATM 7.3 sec or leave<br> :date: __2020-11-19 01:09:43__

> Teladoc works as well as any other video chat app. Get in get out get back to bed.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 16:47:20__

> Great Audio, but I could not see my doctor in the video box for my appointment? It would of been nice to have a clear audio and video screen of my doctor for my medical appointments which are very important to my health and well-being. Most importantly, my doctor was able to communicate with me and address everything in regards to my Teleconference appointment this morning. Thank you- TG<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:34:59__

> This app is very convenient, and I really enjoy being able to get in contact with my physician without leaving my home. Only downer is that its not compatible with chrome books. I would like to be able to use it on the chrome book, as it's my main 'laptop's. Besides that, I have no complaints.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 22:51:18__

> Very survey heavy. One can't just talk to their Doctor, they have to jump through hoops first.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 23:14:05__

> Disconnected twice while in "Waiting Room." Very frustrating for me to have to go back through the whole process of registering for the visit - does the system save my responses when I registered for this appt the first time? WHY, OH WHY do I have to listen to "Katy" tell me how awesome telehealth is. AGAIN?!? Throws off the doctor's schedule while I am logging back in AGAIN and AGAIN to get to the visit. And the screens I see say the doctor canceled my visit. She didn't. This app did.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 19:32:34__

> I've concluded, in an educated way, that 50% of computer programmers are incapable. High paid incompetents at that. Their projects are, essentially, infinite do-loops with no escape. This Virtual Care is a classic example as during a medical PANDEMIC such a medical app should receive the attention of the best of the best, but NO, it is not. Worst of the worst?? What a tragedy. PLEASE find another company to take on completing this app and don't pay for this, heretofore, piece of garbage.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:15:39__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Answering the same questions week after week is annoying. Covid questions for Virtual Visits?? Seriously??!! People have a .02% of catching it and an even lesser % of it being deadly. Do you really think it's gonna transfer thru a phone? js<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:00:55__

> The program freezes up and constantly has to be restarted<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:56:32__

> The concept is awesome, but it would be beneficial to have interaction with the "patient portal" that seton ascension clinics use. Or even to see services and billing history that you can interact with within the app itself.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 20:19:52__

> Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment<br> :date: __2021-01-21 19:47:37__

> Requires wifi which is not always readily available. Does not work well on cellular network<br> :date: __2021-01-19 23:19:24__

> Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it<br> :date: __2020-10-27 20:39:40__

> There are usually technical glitches - audio, video, failure to connect.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 16:25:13__

> I live in Evansville, Indiana. Which app and portal do I need to use for St Vincents outpatient login<br> :date: __2020-08-04 20:35:13__

> The app has a tendency to drop the connection and can take a while to reconnect. This dropping and reconnecting takes time away feom the patient and provider and is very inconvenient. It also tends to not reconnect the video or freezes up. I don't know how new the app it but it has some bugs that need to be worked out. I have not had a session yet were the app has not dropped everything.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 18:53:45__

> Update 6/19/20: The developer reached out and we just had an online 1:1 feedback/user experience interview. I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:33:43__

> Visit froze 3 times. Kind of irritating.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:44:17__

> All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???<br> :date: __2020-12-23 18:37:38__

> App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the "sent" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 15:34:50__

> Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:42:09__

> App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 15:27:27__

> Keeps freezing an breaking up.hard to hear...<br> :date: __2020-06-02 19:48:36__

> Video Quality is not good at all. There's a huge lag and pixeling issues.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 18:53:55__

> Poor video quality & sound. Distorted video while in use and sound cutting in and out.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 22:22:25__

> The app borders on a scam i was under the orders of a doctor taking 2 medications perscribed by the doctor for a sinus infection i needed to contact my doctor for further concerns i was having but because it was simply online care i guess versus being actually treated i was not allowed by the management to get my doctors contact information not only would i never give these people another dime of my money i would not recomend it to anyone else either.

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.
<br>Your voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>How WA Notify works:
<br>When devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.
<br>How WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Washington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.
<br>State law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Washington Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | wanotify@uw.edu |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Got notified today of a possible exposure from last week. I could figure out where I was since I had the date, and go get tested immediately. I wish the app said you SHOULD get tested not only if you have symptoms as the testing center wasn't sure if I met testing criteria. But glad I had the app installed if I can prevent further spread.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 19:24:40__

> "When someone in WA state tests positive for COVID-19 and public health reaches out to them, they will be asked if they have WA Notify and given a verification code. With surging cases, this may take several days." => Seriously? It takes you several days to generate a verification code? And I'm paying taxes for this kind of unprofessionalism? Gov. Inslee, please fire the team that is unable to generate codes instantly for people to add to the app and hire someone better.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 19:05:39__

> Update: I restarted my phone and was able to install WA Notify afterwards. It seems pretty straight forward to use. Old Review: Couldn't get it to install. Acted like it was installing, but the app didn't. Android 8 on unlocked Sony phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 00:10:56__

> I like the idea but it's a little hard on my older battery. I have to idle it when I'm by myself, like in my car. Even if I forget to turn it back on it's still better than not running it at all. I hope more people use it, the more the better.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 19:22:15__

> Update: It took 4 tries to install it but it is finally working on my phone, if you are having issues I would uninstall and try again. This is not working on my Samsung A20 Android phone.

> App worked as expected for the first 2 months, however this morning I see a notice that I need to have location turned on as well as bluetooth. This is unnerving seeing that the app settings on my phone show no permissions are in use. I have android 6 but this same concern is being voiced by an android 9 user here in the comments. This behaviour is new and as I can only toggle location globally on my device this is NOT going to happen. This behaviour is similar to malware. Please correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 13:16:24__

> I received a notification that I was exposed on a day where I had kept my phone in a space not shared with others (no shared wall, etc), as I do every work day. In other words, no one spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of my phone. It is a healthcare facility, so there is little doubt the "exposure" was generated here, but it seems that either the location sharing probably far exceeds 6 feet, or is far less than 15 minutes in order for me to be alerted to exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:36:29__

> Not sure if it's even working<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:59:09__

> Nobody knows how to get this code. When state officials reached out, they didn't even know what this app is and couldn't give me the code. UPDATE: the process is improving and I ended up getting the code. Changing from 1 to 4 stars. This app can save many lives.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:17:39__

> Just got this so too soon to rate, but I have a question. I am an urgent care provider testing patients for COVID so will definitely be in proximity to positive cases. I wish this app had a setting for when you are at work where exposures are protected and another for when you are away from work where exposures may be unprotected.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 03:18:41__

> Need to fix the battery drain on the app<br> :date: __2020-12-29 22:15:48__

> The concept is good. I need to be able to put in co-workers who have tested positive but dont use the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:47:26__

> I think this app will be more useful if more people use it. People are afraid you are tracking their movement's. Need more advertising! The conspiracy theory people will never use it. Sane people will. Thank You<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:41:03__

> The second you turn Bluetooth off it annoys the hell out of you to turn it back on. There needs to be functionality that addresses this gap as people will discontinue use due to the annoyance. Reading the reviews here does not give me confidence that positive cases are being captured properly (even if the person tests positive and gets a verification code by doh) due to the delay from the point they positive test, to them talking to DOH WA to get the code. 2 days to weeks, to possibly never.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 10:30:52__

> Soy positivo y e querido compartir mis resultados pero no reconoce mi código<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:59:26__

> The concept is fine but the fact that we are relying on someone who has the virus to input a code that no one seems to know about makes this app pretty useless. The last year has proven to us that we cannot rely on people to do the right thing so that makes this app double useless. This would have been far more useful if it kept the bluetooth device pinging but used every device's phone number and compared it against a database of known infected person's phone numbers.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 15:09:14__

> I was just wondering if you have to have bluetooth on all the time in order for the exchange of private codes or it it does it automatically?<br> :date: __2021-01-04 07:11:42__

> Nice concept, but poor execution on letting the public know it is available, and letting them know how the app works and what safeguards are in place to protect their privacy. To many people think the app will share personal information, so are unwilling to download it. This is making the app unusable as it was designed to be used.

> This app was a good idea, but there wasn't much thought put into the development of it. There is no way to enter a positive result or exposure without a verification code. This makes the app entirely pointless since I know of nine positive results with no phone calls being dodged, just no way to get a code. This seems like a pretty big oversight.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 01:50:52__

> Literally never a warning... Deleting I don't need to be spied on and literally get nothing back from the app<br> :date: __2021-01-30 05:45:49__

> I do not need constant notifications that my bluetooth is off - it drains my battery, so I only turn it on when I'm at risk of exposure, which is not often. There needs to be on option to turn that notification off, because it's so irritating that I'm on the verge of uninstalling this app, which kind of defeats its purpose, don't you think?<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:32:24__

> Needs bluetooth enabled.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 01:25:15__

> I tested positive and the app wouldn't let me notify people. It turns out the app needs a code, given by Washington State department of health employees when they call you for a phone survey/interview. I received positive test results on Sunday 1/17 and received a phone call follow up on Tuesday 1/19. I brought up the code and was given it, but that was only after the entire call was completed with no mention of the code or app. If I hadn't brought it up it would not have come up otherwise.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 20:54:20__

### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State’s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Edit: I was told by someone I work with that they tested positive, however this app is not showing that info. That's concerning. I'm hoping more and more people download this app. I live in a small community so I'm not sure if I'm ever going to get a notification stating someone tested positive because I don't think many people know about this app. But there are a lot of positives reported to the news by our County Public Health Dept.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 21:18:36__

> Incredibly beneficial<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:46:05__

> Download this app to be notified for possible exposure to Covid. You have to keep Blutooth on at all times for this app to work properly. Not battery intensive though.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 02:35:03__

> Very useful, now I can stay home and be safe.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 10:20:01__

> Please remember that for this app to work everyone who tested positive has to participate. They can't just add peoples information if they don't agree to it. People need to give permission. So if they don't show up it's bc they aren't doing their job to warn people and the community. What else can you expect from an individualistic western culture.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 00:41:59__

> We have several cases of Covid around the corner and the app does not show them. Very disappointed! I hoped this app would help keep my family safe. The app is working. They must have fixed the bugs!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 04:13:22__

> Simple, easy, negligible effect on battery, and unobtrusive. That's great. The biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't indicate that it's even working in any way. I'd suggest that it at least note the number of other devices that it encountered on a daily basis, so a user would 1. be able to gauge how many actual potential exposures they've had and 2. see that the app is actually doing something. e.g. 'You saw 7 other phones today with the CA Notify app...no exposures reported."<br> :date: __2021-02-09 08:19:14__

> I'm sure it works for the people that don't mind being followed and tracked but I'm not one of those I know how important the viruses but people know enough about my whereabouts and everything else already as it is I'm home enough then I don't need to worry so much and I don't want my Bluetooth turned on all the time so I got rid of this app if I was out in public a lot I would still have it<br> :date: __2021-01-19 07:30:18__

> Intuitive and easy but I don't think enough users to be effective. I'm an ER doc in CA and have had on my phone with bluetooth on fo weeks and haven't gotten a single alert despite knowing for certain that I've been exposed. A lot.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 05:46:47__

> Very helpful 🙂<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:27:24__

> I am happy this app is made now. I have seen many other states have this for a while Anyway I hope this app improving updates with a little more specific information about the exposure. For instance, how far are we from the person who is covid-19 positive? How long ago were we exposed to that person? Also the positive covid-19 is still a little murky because does it mean the person is sick or just asymptomatic carrier? And some more specific information to gauge the severity.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 07:26:19__

> I have not seen so much as a blip with this app. Probably because people don't want to be treated like they have Ebola.

I know for certain I've been danger close to numerous people that tested positive with covid-19, but app doesn't recognize that. I assume they need to report it to the app as well .

> Never worked<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:25:40__

> Does this app work? It does not seem to be doing anything after having used it for over a month. It does not show any feedback or confirmation if it is effective or even working. Another problem is the California government has never aggressively promoted this app, which needs widespread adoption to be effective. Without any apparent benefit, what this app only does is constantly consuming power and tracking my every movement, which is why I am uninstalling it after writing this review.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:06:20__

> NEED manual location update button OR ability to temporarily change time between checkins for this to be effective and reduce false sense of security. DOES NOT check frequently enough. Users may go many places in between app updating our location, therefore MISSING DATA for all those locations and people. We NEED an update so app can know ALL places we have been. Otherwise WE MAY NEVER KNOW we were exposed to Covid by someone using the app because the app didn't realize we were near them! What good is this app if it only recognizes very few places someone with Covid has been instead of all of them? NOT HELPFUL!!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:01:38__

### Description
> Feeling sick usually happens at the most inconvenient times. However, that doesn’t mean getting the care you need has to be inconvenient too.
<br>You can now have convenient and quality care at your fingertips and even in the comfort of your own bed with the myVirtualHealthVisit app. The myVirtualHealthVisit app provides an easy way to connect with a live provider when it’s convenient for you. You can access a provider in your car, office, or home. A virtual health video visit eliminates time traveling to the urgent care or waiting for an appointment at a doctor’s office.
<br>Receive quality and convenient care on your terms at a time, location, and cost that fits your lifestyle. Urgent care visits on myVirtualHealthVisit cost only $49 or less.
<br>You might be thinking, “When can I use this app—for a sore throat, cough, or headache?” The answer is Yes! Yes! Yes! myVirtualHealthVisit can be used for common conditions such as:
<br>• Upper Respiratory Infections/Flu
<br>• Bronchitis
<br>• Sinus Infection
<br>• Earache
<br>• Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye)
<br>• Urinary Tract Infection
<br>• Skin Disorders
<br>• Back Pain
<br>In addition to on-demand urgent care services, myVirtualHealthVisit now offers scheduled visits across a variety of specialties with many of Suburban Health Organization’s own Hospital Providers. myVirtualHealthVisit is not for emergency or life-threatening conditions, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. If you have a medical emergency, please call 911 immediately.
<br>Now that you have decided to download the app and are waiting for your virtual health visit to begin, you might be wondering what to expect. You can expect to communicate with a provider through a live video and audio chat. The video and audio chat features allow the myVirtualHealthVisit provider to diagnose, prescribe medication, and suggest an in-person follow-up visit, if you need it.  
<br>Your next question might be, “I have a child who is sick. Can I use this app for my child?” The answer is yes! Additionally, as a patient you can invite others to join your video visit (i.e. a spouse, son/daughter of an elderly patient, parent of a college student, etc.)
<br>Along with your care, your privacy is very important to us. Any information that you provide when enrolling, including your personal health and credit card details, is secure. Your visit is private, and any information that you share with the provider is protected in accordance with HIPAA guidelines for patient safety and confidentiality.
<br>myVirtualHealthVisit is also integrated with Apple Health (iOS only), so you can choose to share your health information with the doctor during your virtual visit, including heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, weight, nutritional information, and respiratory rate.
<br>myVirtualHealthVisit brings a provider to you, regardless of where you live in Indiana. myVirtualHealthVisit is a collaboration among Indiana hospitals working together to promote quality, efficiency, and patient access in the communities they serve. Collaborating hospitals include:
<br>• Goshen Health
<br>• Hancock Health
<br>• Hendricks Regional Health
<br>• Henry Community Health
<br>• Johnson Memorial Health
<br>• Major Health Partners
<br>• Margaret Mary Health
<br>• Marion General Hospital
<br>• Riverview Health
<br>• Witham Health Services

> Only one day<br> :date: __2021-01-26 20:08:39__

> Works pretty darn good to be honest, didn't know for a while but you can video chat with someone on demand, it took me about 10 minutes from tapping the thing to speaking with a clinician, neat! Also crucial was the fact that I told this guy that I had sent a message to the med team, and he was able to pull it up and see it. Well integrated and actually easy to use, which is insane for a medical app<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:23:25__

> Great medical service, pretty good app I'm a huge fan of one medical service, the app mostly upholds their high standards. At times I get notifications that I can't seem to clear, And it's difficult to manage my child's account, who's also a one medical patient on the same app. All told though, I'm pretty happy with the way the app makes finding remote care easy<br> :date: __2020-07-28 14:58:50__

> How do I create a second account or change my present one such that I can get separate messages for myself and a dependent customer on the app? I am the medical POA for the 2nd customer.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:14:24__

> The features all work well but the UX could be improved so that it's easier to figure out "what do I want to do" and then follow a clear path to receiving care from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:46:17__

> Stuck at 66% download. Not sure why. Help!<br> :date: __2020-07-02 04:59:16__

> Would be nice to be able to describe symptoms in my own words, rather than choosing from a list. Other than that, good app. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-02-28 20:49:59__

> Great app, very helpful option for video visits. I was traveling and needed a prescription and they got it to a local pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-02-04 16:23:53__

> I enjoy the (mostly) user friendly design. Medical team responds quickly to questions and requests. I'm disappointed that the app does not correctly sort medical centers by distance from me. I've enabled location tracking, but it still defaults to downtown San Francisco as my location , so I have to scroll down dozens of entries to find the locations that are actually near me.<br> :date: __2020-01-15 00:16:56__

> *Updating my review. The app team contacted me and after much back and forth got it working. The app now functions as promised.* I can't get the app to login. I can login to the website but I just keep getting a generic "something went wrong" error when trying to use the same credentials. There is no app support to contact to try and resolve this.<br> :date: __2019-11-05 11:59:47__

> The doctors are great. The treat me now feature is fantastic. However, customer service 100% unreachable and insurance admin / billing issues take months to resolve.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 01:00:19__

> Doesn't list the provider and clinic I want to go to...pretty frustrating<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:37:08__

> It would be best if the app remembers the last office I went to and keeps that available on My 1med app . Also be on each page maybe. I only use the app on my android. When I see a dot by messages it should dissappear after I have looked at it. Under care plan, there needs to be an option for "other" to leave specific information. I would say....I tried to go to appointment but got lost, or it was too far, or they don't take my insurance. Love the Chat!!!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:55:21__

> Please update home screen icon to adaptive icons to fit in with android 11.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 06:40:12__

> Almost perfect. It works very well. The best of my medical apps. But unread and unread messages look almost exactly the same. The title can be bold, not bold, or grey. Hard to differentiate, even with the screen magnified.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:59:36__

> Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:30:43__

> They removed the bluetooth connection and it no longer connects to blood pressure cuffs. They did this during the last software update. This was a good capability as you didn't have to manually input blood pressure readings. One Medical I.T. should consider restoring this capability.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 23:04:12__

> Could be better in navigation and the resources it offers. I would have preferred if it looked like the desktop site<br> :date: __2020-06-07 10:59:54__

> The treat me now video call feature currently is broken for me (Google Pixel). I get an error "Uh oh looks like something went wrong" when after I request a video visit.<br> :date: __2019-10-07 06:48:13__

> Cannot take a picture of my insurance card. Camera button does not work. Using a Samsung Galaxy S10. It's been months since I last tried, but this issue has not been solved.<br> :date: __2019-09-27 13:20:01__

> This app is pretty much trash on Android. The ability to take a clear photo of your insurance card is not possible. I have a Samsung S10. Push notifications are inconsistent. Thank goodness I get email reminders. The questionnaire is not adaptive. Respond with "None of the above" and the following prompt asks you for more details 🙄. This app has a ways to go before it's useful for more than simply booking an appointment.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 18:56:35__

> Will not load into Ipod on my phone can not delete all the messages recieved its fill my phone. Many issues too be addressed<br> :date: __2020-08-04 01:55:53__

> When an app with more than a few reviews rates higher than 4.8, something other than "app nirvana" may explain. With One Medical, it's a culture of zero tolerance for dissent or constructive criticism. Were it not for this Orwellian imposition of conformity (yes they will retaliate), both One Medical and its app might deserve 4 stars. The app (like the entity) occasionally has glitches (like the 3-year time warp). Putting all that and privacy violations aside (should we?), it can be OK.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 00:58:11__

> New users: Be very careful! One Medical did not indicate that my appointment would not be covered by my insurance nor was any amount ever presented to me beforehand. For a service that is digital and online, that is outright dishonesty, which is tantamount to scamming your customers. Shame on you, One Medical!<br> :date: __2020-09-17 19:54:27__

> Useless app. Useless staff. This app lets any doctor, PA or NP in the system contact you after you've had an initial appointment. They don't care as you get passed around getting messages from more and more inept people. They misplace things, forget things and ultimately waste your time with repetitive messages saying they're working on it. They're not. The interface is clunky. App appointments slots (compared to phone bookings) are not accurate. This app wastes time and money.<br> :date: __2020-07-23 23:26:31__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | UnityPoint Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | unitypointhealth.developers2@gmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Avera Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.avera.org](http://www.avera.org) |
| **Email** | averanow@avera.org |

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> WI Exposure Notification is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Wisconsin supported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WI DHS). WI Exposure Notification helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the local and tribal public health agencies and DHS. 
<br>Using WI Exposure Notification is voluntary and free of charge. It was built with your privacy and security in mind. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively it can be in helping us contain the virus. 
<br>Once you install and activate WI Exposure Notification and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous signals with other devices. These signals, or keys, are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will remember the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will also record the signal strength, which is used to estimate the distance between two devices, as well as the duration and date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days, the keys are deleted. If a WI Exposure Notification user tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive a verification code from the State of Wisconsin.  Users must activate the verification code that is only available from the State of Wisconsin in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>WI DHS wants all app users to feel confident that, when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event to be trusted. When users choose to share a positive test result, this notifies other app users that were close enough to the infected person for a long enough period of time (approximately within 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes in a single day) that they are considered a close contact and at risk of infection. 
<br>Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps. WI DHS takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. WI DHS does not need to know where or who you are for WI Exposure Notification to work. The Wisconsin COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/privacy.htm. 
<br>Please note that WI Exposure Notification is intended for users ages 13 and up. The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Wisconsin - Department of Health Services |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | exposures.notifications.wi@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Wisconsin+-+Department+of+Health+Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Wisconsin+-+Department+of+Health+Services) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> The app sits there and doesn't do much. I haven't received any notifications and I haven't sent any; hope that doesn't change. Does this work with other states or only other people who have this app installed? What do people in Illinois use?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 01:47:32__

> Wonderful app. Since installing the app I have not had the covid. I had concerns about my privacy but since I always wear my medically approved covid mask those concerns vanished since they can't see my whole face. I am also constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands so they can't track my DNA. Wonderful app, everyone should install and take the privacy precautions I do 😷 🧴🧼<br> :date: __2021-01-10 07:01:51__

> I wear a mask because I am a patriot and I care about all lives. Historically Americans provide aid globally for weak and vulnerable, its about time we put America first. Wear your mask. I downloaded this app because I am a patriot and I care about all lives. Using this app may provide valuable exposure information. It will give information to help people know to get tested, to quarantine, or to seek treatment. 2 small steps can save the lives of the vulnerable. That IS the America way!<br> :date: __2020-12-30 15:53:31__

> This app is completely pointless. Not once have I been notified that I have come in close contact with someone infected so it gives me a hunch that no one is using this pointless app. Just another FAIL by One Term Tony and his cronies.

> This app developed by Google is totally useless, a waste of tax payer money, and just another way for Google to track your every move from where you've been to when you took your last dump. I've had this app since the first day it became available in Wisconsin, traveled throughout the state several times and not once have I received a notification? With the high case numbers in WI, I find this very hard to believe. Better to wear your mask, stay safe and don't waste your time with this spyware.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 23:05:19__

### Description
> AlohaSafe Alert is a voluntary new service that helps slow the spread of COVID-19. AlohaSafe Alert is the official exposure notification app of Hawaii and has been designed for use in Hawaii in coordination with the Hawaii State Department of Health.
<br>The goal of AlohaSafe Alert is to support the re-opening of Hawaii communities and economies.
<br>If you have enabled Exposure Notifications on your phone, whenever you are within close proximity (approximately 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes), your phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens. If that person later tests positive for COVID-19, you will receive a notification about a possible exposure. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can share these anonymous tokens, which will send a notification to anyone with whom you have exchanged tokens recently, notifying them of possible exposure.
<br>This service has been designed for use in Hawaii. This service does not collect any personally identifying information or share it with the State of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health, Apple, or Google. AlohaSafe Alert is a source of up to date COVID-19 information & guidance. The AlohaSafe Alert app was built using the open source project developed by PathCheck Foundation.

> I have used the app for about one week now. And there has been no contact warning. Was just wondering if it is still working. I just checked the number of installs and it's more than 10 thousand. That means that less than one of us gets positive each day. Its unlikely that we have had any contact in say the last week. No news is good news.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 02:58:13__

> At 10k downloads, roughly 0.71% of Hawaii's 1,416,000 population are using this app (unless my math is wrong). It's a great app, but more people need to know about it to be truly useful.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 09:51:33__

Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:22:54__

> Quick and easy Hope that more pplpz use this and let others know if get the virus by dem<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:07:46__

> This app has a bug in it. On a moto 6 it grabs the Bluetooth and won't release it. So you have to reboot your phone to connect to your car's hands free system. It should also allow you to adjust exposure time. 15 mins is way too long given the higher contagion strain.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 22:11:42__

> Useless app. People with COVID19 are supposed to be quarantined. Will not work unless other phones have Bluetooth on.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:11:55__

> This app shares the weakness of all of these apps in that it doesn't warn me of shorter exposures rather only if I've been exposed for 15 minutes. Plus it doesn't tell me where the hotspot areas are so I have no way of knowing where or when I should avoid certain places. A minor but annoying point was that this app interfered with the playing of Bluetooth in my car.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:32:00__

> Got aloha safe app cause i live on maui, Hi and am worried about covid numbers rising dramaticly daily so i only activate it when im out grocery shopping or going to the doctors office or anywhere in public then i deactivate it cause it drains battery life and does weird things to my phones touch screen and interferes with other apps on my phone when its on<br> :date: __2021-02-04 18:06:22__

> Good idea ... But not yet ready for prime time, methinks. After I installed it, I could no longer use my Qardio Blood Pressure machine, which also communicates via Bluetooth. So I uninstalled this Nov. 30, 2020, and the Qardio app could connect again. Possibly a coincidence. I'll try this app again in a few weeks, after they've had a chance to iron out the wrinkles. Like I said ... a good idea ... assuming that the app attracts enough users to be useful. It'll need a lot.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 08:23:53__

> This app will never work! People who have covid-19 break quarantine all the time, you still see people not wearing mask, no ones checking on people in quarantine, everyone's still having gatherings with more then 10 ppl.. The list goes on... So don't download this it's worthless you'll never get a notification!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 05:14:49__

> Horrible APP. Not accessible to download on my ipad mini which I always carry. Don't have an apple phone, and it is not downloading on my Samsung phone. I find it offensive that Big Brother is tracking me. Will probably cancel my trip to Maui . Too much trouble yo go there.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 03:54:23__

> My mother is high risk so I felt this app was a great idea. I tried downloading it but it said I didn't have enough space. So I delete three apps that I don't need and some useless pictures. It still says I don't have enough space. So I check how much space I have and it says 615 MB, which should be more than enough to download the stupid app. I check and this app only requires 22MB. I try to redownload and it doesn't work again. Great concept but it won't even let me try it out.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 02:44:44__

### Description
> CURE ID is a reporting site that gathers information on how clinicians around the world are caring for patients with infectious diseases which lack adequate treatments. 
<br>With the CURE Mobile App and Website, you can submit your experience treating an interesting patient and review the experiences of other clinicians with “drug repurposing” – i.e. using existing drugs in new ways (for new diseases, in new combinations, or new doses/durations). You can also participate in discussions with a global clinical community.
<br>We are interested in all cases, including those where the patient improved, deteriorated, or even had an indeterminate outcome. 
<br>Join the global community of clinicians sharing their real-world experiences using repurposed drugs for infectious diseases that lack adequate treatment!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> HEALTHCARE, RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
<br>The Virtual Care Anywhere app brings the doctor visit to you – when and where you need it. Within 30 minutes of requesting care, you’ll be speaking with a board-certified doctor or registered nurse practitioner.
<br>Our team of board-certified doctors and nurse practitioners are available 24/7 to provide consultations, diagnoses, and treatment via video chat or phone. No appointment is needed. Our team can also call prescriptions (those that are deemed clinically appropriate) into your local pharmacy. 
<br>Use Virtual Care Anywhere for common conditions, such as:
<br>•	Cold and flu
<br>•	Pink eye
<br>•	Rash
<br>•	Stomach flu
<br>•	Allergies
<br>•	Back pain
<br>•	Urinary tract infections in adult women
<br>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
<br>1. What does it cost?
<br>Each Virtual Care Anywhere visit costs a flat fee of $35, always. There are no hidden or added charges. At the beginning of your visit, the provider will determine whether your health concern is appropriate for virtual urgent care. If it’s not, you will not be charged for the visit.
<br>2. Will insurance cover my visit?
<br>Most insurance plans do not cover virtual health services at this time, and we cannot guarantee reimbursement. However, a Virtual Care Anywhere visit is a qualified medical expense and you can typically use your HSA or FSA account to pay for it. An invoice that you can submit to your insurance plan for reimbursement will be available through the web portal for your Virtual Care Anywhere account after each visit. 
<br>3. How does a virtual visit with Virtual Care Anywhere work?
<br>You will meet with one of our medical providers via phone or video chat. You can request a video chat through the mobile app, via our website, or by calling our toll-free number.
<br>Our website requires that JavaScript and cookies be enabled. If you are unable to access the website or experience technical difficulties, please call our patient concierge team at (855) 356-8053.
<br>4. Who is eligible?
<br>Virtual Care Anywhere is available to people of all ages, across the United States. Virtual visits are not available to those covered under a federal insurance program such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, or Tricare, unless you are specifically set up by your insurance plan administrator.
<br>5. Will my primary care provider receive my visit summary?
<br>After every virtual visit, the Virtual Care Anywhere provider will write a personalized visit summary that outlines the visit, treatment recommendations and outcomes. You can choose whether to share it (or not) with your primary care provider at the close of the visit. This visit summary is accessible at any time from your Virtual Care Anywhere account page.

> Great doctor and fairly quick response. I felt comfortable with the quality and care.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 17:03:14__

> Took a little while to see someone even though it said I was next in line. It threw me into another doctors que after I'd been waiting in another room for 10 min.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 15:50:19__

> Cool efficient experience.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 11:35:23__

> Took about 2 hrs to see a dr. But was very pleased when I finaly got thru. Stood in line 3 times and was transferred to a different on each time. Any way my daughters getting the treatment she needs with out getting exposed to anyone else's germs I'm pleased.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 20:21:32__

> It took me a LONG time to FINALLY get thru plus i kept getting switched back and forth from doctor to doctor but then I called customer support and was told to "choose a specific provider" instead of "first available provider." When I finally got connected to a doctor, he was a very nice, patient, and helpful doctor. Thank you 😊<br> :date: __2020-03-23 02:47:06__

> The Dr's on here are pretty nice and the fee is reasonable at only $30. I used this when I didn't have health insurance and needed Dr's notes for my work. However, this app has no support email or phone number. They have a "number" but when you call its just static. I emailed the developer email when I had an inquiry, and there was no response. On top of that, there's no option to delete your account or your payment info, if you want to stop using the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:40:42__

> The app clearly says you can use it to diagnose rashes but of course the doctor then says it's hard to diagnose rashes through the app and then guesses what it might be. I'll have to go in to a clinic which I was trying to avoid in the first place. The app is fine and easy to use. It would be nice if you could choose the gender of the doctor. I like the follow up message for my records. I liked that I could upload photos of my symptoms but the doctor I got didn't seem to have looked at them.<br> :date: __2019-10-30 15:06:21__

> Mediocre. Couldn't connect video, though every other video call app works for me. Call quality was iffy. There's no written summary of my visit?! No email. No receipt for my payment. No way to send a message within the app with questions. My local hospital system is linked to this and my virtual chart there has no record of my "visit".<br> :date: __2020-07-17 18:27:19__

> I was skipped over multiple times and put behind other patients after I had been notified the Dr was about to see me. This is pretty unacceptable. I'm guessing they felt other cases were more urgent than mine, when in actuality I needed to be headed for the emergency room. Very upsetting.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 06:42:22__

> Due to being late at night and unsure of current urgent care procedures for COVID opted to try Virtual Care. Talked on the phone to nice professional, who agreed with me on symptoms, will write a prescription for antibiotic and i can pick up tomorrow. Next morning i go to my pharmacy ( double checked to make sure it was the right one) they said no prescription was written. Tried calling on call nurse who said call virtual care and get charged again. Now sitting in urgent care anyway.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 22:48:25__

> free visit code doesn't work. can't find my login information. keeps switch Dr.'s<br> :date: __2020-05-02 02:41:48__

> The app works OK. I just can't believe I got charged $35 for a dismissive MD to spend less than 90 seconds to tell me to keep doing the same things that aren't working.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 21:19:01__

> Waste of money video dropped and $35 for them to tell me I have to go in and be seen. And that will be another Co payment!<br> :date: __2020-09-26 18:02:54__

> App is garbage. Has NO customer service support, a pathetic description of services and no where to input insurance information<br> :date: __2020-08-24 13:53:43__

> I wouldn't get connected for 2 full calls. Waited for 40 minutes for both calls. They said that they couldn't even diagnose me and that I still had to physically go to a provider. I wasted 35 dollars and now I have to go in and pay another 60 dollars. Save your money they like to say everything is associated to Covid. A simple stomach ache.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 05:42:02__

> This smells scam. Doesn't seem to belong to any network. Not even sure it was a real doctor who called me. Misspelled both my last and the first name on the referral to practically nowhere. Left me guessing "What was it?" I used the government sponsored code, definetely wouldn't give them my credit card. Some shady money making app.<br> :date: __2020-06-23 21:19:00__

> I just waited, not even exaggerating, FOUR HOURS!! Because I neeeed to see a doctor and get into one in person. After 4 hours and wasting most of my day I excited out just for me to see the doctor I was waiting on was still available. Very unhappy!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-04-28 00:56:15__

> Doctor didn't listen to me and his note reflected that.😒<br> :date: __2020-04-13 18:47:20__

> This was useless.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 20:42:12__

> I was disconnected right at 5pm after waiting in line. Then it wanted me to start over. So Rude!!! I do not want any charges for this app or appointment. 3.31.20 i just do not want any charges 4 this app coming out of my google play where i had 2 download.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 03:31:06__

> I started with 18 patients waiting that was for 4hrs, and when I was my turn, It transferred me to another doctor for a 53 patients wait. That's BS!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-03-30 09:48:03__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | MetroPlus Health Plan |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | Customer.Support@AmericanWell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MetroPlus+Health+Plan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MetroPlus+Health+Plan) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app was developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) as a component of their COVID-19 homeless response strategy. The app is designed to equip homeless outreach workers across LA County to triage the sick and most vulnerable and monitor spread among the 50,000+ people experiencing homelessness in LA County. 
<br>This app enables outreach teams and coordinators to…
<br>- Conduct surveys with individuals experiencing homelessness to determine best safety advice or course of action for those who are symptomatic (survey developed by doctors at Housing for Health, Division at the Department of Health Services based on FEMA and CDC guidance). 
<br>- See locations of individuals in need of outreach follow up.
<br>- View hotspots of individuals and homeless encampments to track resource and response needs countywide.
<br>Use of this application is available to any current or new homeless outreach worker tasked with triaging the sick and most vulnerable and monitoring spread of COVID-19 (authorized by homeless service providers and governing bodies like the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority).


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Akido Labs |
| **Website**  | [https://akidolabs.com](https://akidolabs.com) |
| **Email** | hotspot@akidolabs.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Ecellent! Dr. Withers is a true professional. Prescribed amoxicillin for my teeth and 72 hour headache that has been getting worse by the day! I have total confidence in UW Health as you have always treated me with respect from day 1. This saved me from going to urgent care.

> Got transferred twice, waited a half hour, and spoke with the rudest doctor. They can't handle common things like ear infections so it's pretty worthless app and process. Coupled with the charge (should be fully covered by insurance) this app and essentially the entire process is useless. If you have a runny nose I guess this might be up your alley, but otherwise it's a complete waste of time and technology for them to offer this service and then not offer care.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 03:10:22__

> Covid19 hotline told me to talk to a doctor immediatly, and i put in my insurance and it still wants me to pay exactly 50 bucks to video chat. America is better than this.<br> :date: __2020-03-30 05:29:22__

> Won't connect me to video chat despite having permissions to do so. Tried twice which took two hours cuz each time I had to wait for a doctor to try to connect which then ended up not connecting and the doctor disconnected. Not what we need in this health crisis!

> Easy interface, worked well<br> :date: __2020-08-19 22:06:36__

> Visually I can see the doctor very clear and audio was great as well. Overall great experience. Just wasn't sure about switching of the doctors last minute.<br> :date: __2020-07-09 04:10:27__

> Would've given a higher rating if not for waiting on a doc 10 mins then canceling and choosing another one who marked herself as unavailable while i was entering my info and then finally getting a 3rd one. It was smooth sailing from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-02 21:32:57__

> Super easy but make sure you and your provider have a solid wifi connection. We had some video issues which did thankfully resolve before completion of the call.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 13:28:26__

> The app works well. I do feel the camera capabilities could be better. I could not focus the image even though I know my phone is capable of doing so.<br> :date: __2020-04-07 13:46:28__

> Have used this app 3 times already and really like the convenience of telemedicine. One thing I would suggest to the App developers is if they could make this app work on top of other apps for multitasking. Then I would rate 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-03-12 13:37:10__

> Needs a lot of improvements. I'll rate it again later on but right now needs work. It has a mayor issue with the login screen where the mask it use to hide the remembered email results in a wrong email or password message if you don't delete and write everything. It becomes a hassle specially when you're in a hurry because the appointment is about to begin and you have to upload pictures and everything. Please check the login experience there is better technologies available right now.<br> :date: __2019-01-04 19:05:55__

> Clinicians need to wear headsets to avoid feedback during calls. Took two hours to troubleshoot issues and I'm a Healthcare IT security analyst. App does not sync with patient portal / EMR natively which caused part of problem. Other problem is that for most Google users, the email coming from domain will go into spam. Pediatric Associates need to go with a full-fledged telehealth solution instead of this fly by night, TytoCare (AmWell) app.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 01:14:23__

> Horrible<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:25:18__

> Waited in line for an hour. Was next for a doctor and had the connecting circle go round and round, but never connected. Eventually the doctor disconnected. He did call to apologise and explain it was not connecting, but ultimately it did not work.<br> :date: __2020-03-16 15:49:37__

> I rather physically take my children to the doctors office<br> :date: __2020-01-18 18:50:57__

> Overpriced. Classist. Our doctor's office plugs them. I downloaded the app and immediately deleted it when I saw there's a $59 copay even with insurance! Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2019-11-09 00:23:06__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Augusta University |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Augusta+University](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Augusta+University) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> UT Exposure Notifications is the official Exposure Notifications app of Utah and the Utah Department of Health. Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service.
<br>UT Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.
<br>By enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you were closer than 6 feet from someone who has the virus for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or longer in a 24 hour period, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you’ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you of a possible exposure.
<br>If you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Utah Department Of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | contact.tracing@utah.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Let's hope enough people install this.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 09:27:52__

> I'm excited for an app to notify about exposure, if we had this 6-9 months ago we could have seriously flattened the curve and saved lots of lives. This app will need pretty good installation rate to be effective. It looks like 5k installations today so far.(I think this is the first day), hopefully the adoption continues. We needed this 6-9 months ago, before the vaccine was available to slow the spread. Well here's hoping lots of people install it!<br> :date: __2021-02-17 23:44:40__

> I appreciate that this app allows people to be notified anonymously that they've been exposed so maybe people will feel more comfortable communicating testing status vs trying to reach out to everyone they may have been in contact with.
