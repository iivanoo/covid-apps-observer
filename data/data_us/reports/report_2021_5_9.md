The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

This report has been produced independently of any parties and its only objective is to help anybody in better understanding how COVID-related apps work in practice (and compare to each other). The results of this report are limited to the specific version of the software used for running the analyses and on the various heuristics implemented in there.

### Description
> Care19 is the official COVID-19 app for the states of South Dakota and North Dakota.  It can be used with reduced functionality in other US states.
<br>A key part of the contact tracing process is remembering where you have been over the last 5-10 days before testing positive.  This helps contact tracers determine people you may have been near while you were infectious. 
<br>Care19 is a digital diary that records places you visit.  Many of the places you visit can be recorded automatically by Care19 using the phone's location services.  In some cases you may need to manually add an entry if the automated routines miss a place visit.  This can happen based on a variety of environmental factors.
<br>You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information within the app. Location data will only be shared with the North Dakota or South Dakota Department of Health if you consent upon testing positive for COVID-19. This is done by sharing a code number displayed on the “About” section of the app.  
<br>If you use the Care19 app outside of North and South Dakota it can be used as a memory aide if you test positive and are contacted by your state's Department of Health.


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProudCrowd, LLC |
| **Website**  | [https://www.care19.app](https://www.care19.app) |
| **Email** | tim.brookins@proudcrowd.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This picks up most of the places I go, and I check when I get home so I can add places it has missed or change inaccurate locations, which only happens when I am in an area with a lot of stores, like a plaza. My home state has not chosen an app so I use this one.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 22:03:28__

> I just dont have room on my phone:(<br> :date: __2020-07-06 11:55:41__

> The early release back in April was rough (didn't log any stops for me). But it's been working well for me since about May 4. It occasionally logs more than one stop at the same location. It occasionally gets the name of the location wrong, but this is very easy to correct.<br> :date: __2020-05-19 06:25:30__

> Doesn't this app use the Contact Tracking System that Apple and Google developed?<br> :date: __2020-06-02 15:29:17__

> Simple app. Does what it was designed for but little else. Misses many locations and frequently has location accuracy issues. Routinely misses my home by 6 blocks. Says I have visited locations I have just driven past. Would be nice to have ability to add locations that I visited but app failed to record.<br> :date: __2020-05-22 15:52:32__

> Each week, 2 out of the 5 days I'm at work there's no entry. Yesterday it showed me in the middle of road halfway to work for 8.5 hours. If I stop somewhere on my way home from work, half the time it misses it. I have a Pixel 3 XL. I want to have this app work.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 23:21:53__

> App runs unnoticeably in the background. However, requires constant maintenance. If I go more than 2-3 days without monitoring the app, I find that it stops tracking my locations, at which point I need to go back through all intro screens as if I just installed the app (Region, Consent, Home location, etc). Back arrow on Android while in the Places You've Visited will also return to the initial menu and require passing through all intro screens again, or app will not resume tracking. Should have a warning, and consent/home location should be saved in a more permanent cache.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:23:18__

> Doesn't catch all locations, and it recorded a one hour visit to one store as 12 minutes, then would not allow correction.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 13:10:23__

> Quit recording anything after about three weeks.<br> :date: __2020-07-26 05:30:54__

> Gives a lot of erroneous locations that are passed while driving or stopping at a stop light. Some days it gives no information at all.. i reloaded it a couple of weeks ago. It worked well until July 3 then quit working, not registering any locations.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 20:23:07__

> Not very accurate for locations. It does not show several places my wife & I have been for an hour or more and it shows us stopping at places we only drove passed on our way to our destination that does not show up. Very inaccurate. It's the same on both of our phones (Galaxy Note 9's). There is no way to add the places we did go to, only to delete the irrelevant ones or change the name from "Unknown" to a proper name. It's pointless/useless for tracking when this inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-06-05 01:20:41__

> Installed this last spring when it first was available, had it for months, and then found out it wasn't tracing anything because it closes down unless you open it constantly. What's the point of a tracing app that doesn't trace? And what's the point of an app that you have to open that doesn't do anything except show you a screen that says "hi, I'm open, now you can close me"? This should just run quietly in the background when your phone is on. South Dakota, you can do better. We expect more.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 20:13:46__

You say it's just the way it is, no, you know how it's supposed to work, so find someone to make it work correctly. This app does not trace where I been going. It does not stay open in the background. When open, it does not show where I go or been since the 23rd. I restarted phone and reinstalled app on S9+<br> :date: __2020-08-11 03:56:40__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |
| **Website**  | [http://www.fema.gov](http://www.fema.gov) |
| **Email** | FEMA-New-Media@fema.dhs.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Federal+Emergency+Management+Agency+(FEMA)) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> What's with the 911 button? It's way too easy to accidentally hit that. Otherwise the setup seems pretty well designed.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 15:45:33__

> Good ad-free alerts app. Lets you specify the exact kinds of alerts you want for your area and others. It's only drawback is that its county-wide. Some alerts are issued for only specific areas of counties. This app would be perfect if would allow you to set alerts to a precise location (not just county-wide) as some other apps do. Also it needs other notification options (such as a voice or different sound) for alerts so they don't get lost with other notifications.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 21:27:43__

> I think that it's pretty good.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 04:02:31__

> This app is worth the download. You get a lot of notifications, but they are easy to mute, and might save your life.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 22:03:12__

> Really good weather alerts better than local tv<br> :date: __2021-01-26 10:34:47__

> So I love this app, but I feel as if you guys should check the reviews. There are people there with legitimate concerns, and some great recommendations that your should take look at. Such as: -Missing Alerts -A "Follow Me" option. -A priority alert mode (that fully covers your screen when you get a warning alert). I had a tornado warning in my area, and I love that I recieved it when using the app, but you should force the users to see a warning. These are the 3 options I'd love to see come.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 03:51:39__

> It has a lot of information anyone would ever need in this nation you could help you self and others in anything<br> :date: __2020-11-25 07:22:21__

> App has grown over the years and I appreciate the work that has gone into making it. My alerts are timely for the different counties that I've entered. THAT being said: The app has the potential to be so much more. Save lives. Can you please make it less time consuming to use? When I travel I need to hear *alerts in the County I'm IN.* What I would like to see in an update is the use of GPS to alert me *wherever* I am. Also.. Why isn't anyone taking advantage of the Blog section?<br> :date: __2020-11-06 20:45:42__

> Decent at first glance<br> :date: __2020-09-27 05:28:47__

> Haven't had this installed for 24 hours yet however it was easy to install, set which alerts I want/need for the counties I need. I don't get weather alerts for whatever yhe reason (checked settings) and had to depend on others to relay alerts. I can now get the alerts myself and it may be a lifesaver since where I live we get severe weather, tornados and hurricanes regularly.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 22:42:49__

> It's helpful to have the alerts, but they come constantly about the same issue. They need to bundle alerts together and just say it's been updated.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:19:12__

> Works, but it keeps announcing the same alerts over and over, almost to the point of harassment! Also, the developer evidently does not read user comments, because they have not replied to any, a lot of which contain very good suggestions.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:07:44__

> Downloaded b/c we live in the country and cant hear sirens. Ive been getting notifications of weather advisories, but not able to read what, theres nothing there<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:56:35__

> Not much exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:03:49__

> Not as helpful as before<br> :date: __2020-12-28 07:32:52__

> They did not explain what she was asking me about and was real short with me . To me she was rude but I need my house fixed not TVs or other stuff like that but thank you for what you did do.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 19:49:29__

> Also I build homeless shelters and I think this would be the place to add my location make it official<br> :date: __2020-10-06 07:13:34__

> Works but would multiply the same alerts<br> :date: __2020-10-03 19:46:59__

> Sends out alerts as expected, but here's the issue. If I'm in another app (Facebook, e.g.), it won't override it, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the alert within the actual app, so if you miss it... too bad. Also tried to pull up the app while roaming, and got a "no wifi" connection error. Who the hell has wifi during an emergency??? DO BETTER.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 18:35:21__

> Was a great App, then started sending multiple alerts one after another. Now I get NO alerts at all. If I click on Alerts, click my city, it takes me to settings. I wrote you about it, you sent an email telling me to restart because you fixed a bug on the 4th. It is now the 14th. I've done as you said, even uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I still get no alerts and when I click my city, it still takes me to settings. I loved your App, it's a shame it no longer functions correctly.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 21:54:56__

> Super irregular performance and notifications. I cannot rely on this for requested information or results<br> :date: __2020-12-12 02:22:01__

> Need more control over types of alerts. Don't need to be woken from deep sleep at 3 am for fog warning, for instance. Fog won't harm me when safe in bed in sturdy house unless I hurt myself being startled in my sleep by loud notification.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:17:51__

> Once I sign in it then sends me a email code to sign in again.... To many steps<br> :date: __2020-09-19 20:23:31__

> Installed this app months ago and expected this would be the moment for it. I'm getting "red flag warnings" and "evacuation alerts" every few minutes (with no date or timestamp) that just say things like "GO NOW Eden Road" with a web link I can't click or copy. After switching back and forth between apps to type out it turns out it's a map and Eden Road is 60 miles away. You can't set alerts for regions smaller than the entire county. Evac notices also came through sooner with other services.<br> :date: __2020-09-12 07:56:04__

> What is it with this app. I've.been trying to download it for three days how long does it take to for it to download .we are about to be hit with a hurracain.this is messed.up<br> :date: __2020-08-23 03:40:24__

> My name is DIANE KMIEC (not A Google User)!!! 3/27/21: I MUST UNINSTALL. I have received NO ALERTS or EMERGENCY data since the 1st days. Very alarmed that "FEMA" can't even get through to send me Emergency Alerts! \*\*\*\* I installed this. I hope it works as it should because my phone has been modified to stop me from receiving ANY Emergency alerts. (I believe that's illegal.) I am so desperate to receive Emergency Alerts that I'm downloading an outside app for it!<br> :date: __2021-03-27 23:50:09__

> I am deleting this app. I get 6 or more notifications a day when we are getting 2-4 inches of snow. It wakes me in the middle of the night to update when I have already recieved the same notification before. It's too bad, I liked getting the bitter windchill warning. If the weather was serious it would be fine but I don't consider 4 inches of snow a blizzard.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 00:50:48__

> Into a busy season and it's worse (after weather alert this morning there have been at least 5 false/blank alerts). Even after clearing cache, rebooting phone, etc still getting multiples of same exact alerts and several alerts with little or no lead time and now (once again) many - almost 40% - warnings with no info at all or nothing updated in the alert information. That's probably FEMA but still seriously downgrades usefulness. So problematic that other weather apps are needed for safety.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:00:29__

> Why wasn't there an alert when the POTUS called the state of emergency for DC? He even mentioned FEMA for receiving info yet crickets feo FEMA. Z Typical government restrictions. If they block adding Washington D.C. as an area then they are blocking additional information. It will only have the activity they want you to know about. New rule for citizens. See something say nothing. You'll be safer that way.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 21:44:55__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |
| **Website**  | [http://www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov) |
| **Email** | CDCMobileDevelopment@cdc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CRUSH COVID RI is a COVID-19 pandemic response app that provides Rhode Islanders with easy access to all of the resources required during the public health crisis, and includes features such as a location diary and symptom diary. 
<br> 
<br>All Rhode Islanders are encouraged to use the CRUSH COVID RI app and take an active role in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island.  You can make a difference in the health of your loved ones and your community by helping us track the virus in our state.  
<br> 
<br>CRUSH COVID RI is a one-stop place to get all the information you need about COVID-19 in Rhode Island. It also has two features you can use to help everyone in the community.  
<br> 
<br>The My Location Diary feature uses GPS location data that is already available from your phone to help you easily track the places you visited over the past 20 days. All data will be stored locally on your device. It is only shared when you voluntarily decide to share it. If you test positive for COVID-19, and you agree to share this information with the Rhode Island Department of Health, they can quickly identify places you went and people you were in contact with and reduce the spread of COVID-19.    
<br> 
<br>The My Symptom Diary feature lets you tell us if you have any symptoms and only asks you to provide your zip code.  If you submit this quick survey daily, it will help give us early indicators of COVID-19 spread in certain zip codes so we can respond by doing things like setting up testing sites in that area.  
<br> 
<br>Together we can #CrushCovidRI. 
<br> 
<br>Please see our Terms of Use (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/termsofuse/) & Privacy Policy (https://health.ri.gov/covid/crush/privacypolicy/) for further information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Rhode Island |
| **Website**  | [https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid](https://health.ri.gov/crushcovid) |
| **Email** | CrushCovid.Survey@health.ri.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Rhode+Island) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Kudos to the state and the developers for working to put this out. Maybe needs some improvements but none I can suggest. Last update was great allowing us to add names to location diary.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 23:21:21__

> Update: started using again with the update to see if there is improvement. Still need to add a manual addition for location if the locator doesn't pick up where you were for less that 10 minutes. Also, you still can't fix where you went if the locator is slightly off. Today, I went bowling, not get my nails done. Now you can add notes, so that helps. Location info not 100% accurate. Since I don't spend 20 minutes at every place I visit, you should add a location manually button.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 21:09:13__

> Good app, but still could use some improvements. The ability to correct an address would be helpful, as the GPS frequently does not accurately record it. Also, if possible, the ability to label regular addresses, like Home, and have it be remembered. Finally, the app frequently would revert to 5 day look back, even if I choose 20 day, as I was checking my history and making updates. I would have to back out and reload the location diary and then choose 20 day again.<br> :date: __2020-07-12 15:18:33__

> I have used this app regularly since downloading it months ago & while it was a rudimentary app in the beginning the 2.0 upgrades were a good improvement. What I DON'T find helpful is with today's update, I am forced to turn on my GPS feature in order to take the daily symptom survey; this is completely unnecessary as I may not have any plans to leave my house. I'm not a fan of an app controlling how my device works. Also the "No thanks" option does nothing, and I have to force the app closed.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:12:33__

I just want to do anything I can to help stop the spread. However, this app accounts for 35 PERCENT of my battery usage.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Not even the hospitals where i work at are aware of this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 16:49:46__

> I don't see how this app can be helpful at all for contact tracing. Few people in Arizona I know are aware of this app, and even if they're informed about it, it doesn't even appear in a general search with keywords. Then it will randomly inform you that you have a notification and, when you click to find out what it is, it will tell you that you have no notifications. You'll have an icon that sits in your notifications for 12 hours telling you that it's looking for exposures that can't be dismissed. Also, you can't even choose Phoenix nor Maricopa County as your location despite that being the most populous region of the state; your options are Tucson, Flagstaff, and "State of Arizona" which apparently isn't even functional.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 20:07:20__

> Great idea but unclear. IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is "State of Arizona". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????<br> :date: __2020-10-06 19:06:36__

> This app worked perfectly for me to begin with. Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 01:17:53__

> Meh! Problem is not with the app, problem is with the state of Arizona. The state and it's governor are anti maskers. The governor is a businessman turned politician so opening up everything is more important than deaths. Voters believe in a alternate reality freedom. It's okay to have laws about drunk driving, and wearing seatbelts but make them wear a mask and you won't get their votes.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 04:56:21__

> Was hopeful for this, but this app is *extremely* limited. With only around 10K downloads (assuming these are still installed and running), there's no way it can function effectively for contact tracing. First, this had apparently been available since August 2020? No one knows about this app. Second, there needs to be a way for users to report their own exposures to those diagnosed covid positive, not just personal diagnoses - consider medical field workers: doctors, nurses, pharmacy.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 20:29:24__

> I know I've been potentially exposed and have received no exposure notifications<br> :date: __2021-01-30 19:11:05__

> Pretty useless since statewide reporting is not available for the app. Need to change the name to UofA/ASU COVID Tracker since they're the only regions that actually work.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 16:06:21__

> This app only works for UofA & NAU and isn't on the CDC's list so trying to find it is challenging. What are the developers waiting for, especially with the current spike in Arizona? It dosen't do any good to share this with others if no one can add there positive diagnosis in an unsupported region (meaning the rest of the state).<br> :date: __2020-11-23 16:02:59__

> Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What "region" am I in and what "local" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process.<br> :date: __2020-10-19 03:19:06__

### Description
> COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 
<br>How COVIDWISE Works: 
<br>If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 
<br>The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
<br>VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. 
<br>Anonymously Share Positive Test Results With COVIDWISE:
<br>When VDH receives any positive COVID-19 lab result registered with a valid mobile phone number, we will automatically send a text message to that individual, which provides rapid notification and encourages them to stay home and away from other people. The text also lets individuals who have tested positive know they may retrieve an 8-digit verification code from the COVIDWISE Verification Portal at https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/CWP. You must enter your last name, date of birth, and the phone number that matches the information from your registered COVID-19 test to verify your positive result.
<br>You may use that 8-digit verification code in order to anonymously report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVIDWISE! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

> It would be good to be able to submit that you've received the vaccine. Not sure if it's updating or not, I've never received a notification but that could also be because not enough people use it? It has lots of helpful information tho!<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:08:50__

> I think the app works, I mean I haven't gotten any notifications nor have I gotten covid so I guess?<br> :date: __2021-03-01 19:26:17__

> The app is performing as designed. Although, I'd like to see enhancements commensurate with the ramped-up vaccination going on- e.g., the ability to also mark yourself vaccinated, which vaccine, and even lot # would provide valuable metadata and insights into tracing contact with those NOT yet vaccinated.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 22:25:24__

> 👍👍<br> :date: __2021-02-15 20:05:33__

> It seems my phone was just slow and loaded the app in the background. Looked later and there it was.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:20:49__

> Fundamental problem: this app has almost no public outreach throughout Virginia, and apparently there is a faulty verification process for PATIENTS VOLUNTEERING POSITIVE RESULTS. As long as these issues remain, this app is mostly a failure. This is a critical PR issue that won't be fixed with improved app code<br> :date: __2021-01-07 07:15:35__

> Trying to figure out how this at work<br> :date: __2021-04-01 04:10:03__

> The app has twice stopped updating. I did get instructions to load another state's app, activate that in place of covidwise, then reload covidwise and reactive. It works but why does the checking just stop?<br> :date: __2021-03-27 19:41:27__

> Good idea, but utility is totally dependant on enough people downloading it to make notifications meaningful. There is no way to know...<br> :date: __2021-03-25 21:01:28__

> Great idea concept, except it does not work in MA. Plus, it will only alert you if someone actively states they have tested positive before going out in public. Some will see it as a HIPPA violation, even though they consent to saying they've tested positive. It doesn't say who, just alerts you to possible exposure. Would like to see this accepted nationwide, and notifications for if you're in a "high risked" area, rather than hoping someone claims they're positive and running errands.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 18:29:33__

> Pointless<br> :date: __2021-03-11 05:52:57__

> Stopped using this because NOBODY else seemed to be using it Great idea but I think most people felt like it was an invasion of their privacy. Plus, we have to rely on people being honest about their health.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 20:31:29__

> It was working and put date of checking very often. Now it hasn't did anything since feb 10.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:46:45__

> I am safe.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:22:10__

> Yikes! I wish I saw the reviews before. It's a good idea but either the VDH doesn't have the resources to handle reporting for this app or something else is going on. Damn this gives me a false sense of security, which is bad since I'm both a retail essential worker, and I also reside with my older in laws.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 11:51:01__

> I will admit, I felt so much better about life when this app came out. I wish it were mandatory for all Virginians just like our masks. We would be more efficient at slowing the spread, if it were mandatory and working properly. Unfortunately, my exposure notification hasn't updated since January 5, 2021after working great for months. Please help! I want to be part of the solution. Cannot do that if the app isnt working properly. I keep my bluetooth on at all times, that's not the problem.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:08:59__

> Unfortunately something is clearly wrong with this app. It worked perfectly until sometime in January or February. Now it will check for exposures for a while and then just stop.

> Since a recent update I get alert after alert after alert if I don't have BT or GPS enabled. One alert is enough. I don't want to have this on when I'm at home and I don't want to be constantly spammed with alerts. It is enough to make me consider deleting the app, which is counter productive, Virginia.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 10:56:08__

> Never really got to see how the app worked. Got COVID, but never got a number to enter my positive results in the app. I'm a construction Project Manager and have been on jobsites with lots of COVID cases, and have worked at retirement communities with outbreaks. I never got a notification that I may have been exposed. I assume this is largely due to the barriers in entering positive results. Neat idea, but terrible execution.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 01:09:28__

So download the app and wear a mask when your out and about for just a little bit longer and we will be on the other side of this whole ordeal in no time.

> It only works if others report that they've had COVID-19 so I'm not sure what the point is. I've been around people who have recovered from the virus but the app did NOT show that I've been exposed.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 06:27:27__

> I wanted to alert people about possible exposure to Covid as soon as I recieved my positive results but was unable to due to the verification code requirement. I called all over the place and sent out emails and got no closer ro alerting people until 6 days after my positive test when the Washoe County Health department called for contact tracing and gave me the code. So it appears that the app works but you probably won't be notified about exposures for about a week after someone tests positive<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:15:25__

> Kind of a pointless app when after your test positive literally no one that contacts you knows the code necessary to self report.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 05:05:47__

> I mean, sure, I suppose it'd work, but let's be real. The chances of anyone between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies actually self-reporting is kind of on the low end. This makes the app basically useless. Something like it in Korea, that'd work fine, since they take contact tracing seriously<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:02:59__

> "Reload" Ineffective It's 08:00, and I have been out in public for an hour, but it last checked exposures at 3:15 yesterday. I do not normally leave Bluetooth on, so I have been turning off my Bluetooth at bedtime at night, and back on in the morning. Today I turned it back on before 06:00, and have tried to "reload" but it still won't re-check. I saw some others with the same issue; maybe it's Android, maybe it's Bluetooth but doesn't seem to work well.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:08:05__

> Sadly, most of the cases in Nevada originate from tourists. That's why there were so few cases before the casinos opened back up. They won't have this app so it's only able to account for the people who come in contact with people who caught it working in tourist areas. Sadly, people keep coming here as opposed to going into quarantine when they test positive.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 20:17:35__

> Update: Its fixed. I hope people use this as a great tool to assist 7s in fighting COVID-19. The app will not let me go beyond the 3rd page. It doesnt work. My bluetooth and location are on. The "exposure notification" will not let me turn it on as it says "I need to finish setting up the app" others instructions say the "exposure notification" must be on to finish the app. ?????

> Due to the reviews, I have decided to not waste my time and efforts on this app. I'll continue to watch the news reports online of where the hot spots are and continue to be safe as possible.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Delaware Department of Health and Social Services |
| **Website**  | [https://de.gov/covidalert](https://de.gov/covidalert) |
| **Email** | DHSS_COVIDAlertDE@delaware.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Delaware+Department+of+Health+and+Social+Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Delaware+Department+of+Health+and+Social+Services) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

### Description
> Guam Covid Alert, an app by the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services helps aid contact tracing for COVID-19 by using the privacy centric Exposure Notification System. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available.
<br>Receive alerts from the local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>The goal of Guam Covid Alert by the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities. Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Guam Covid Alert app was built using an open source project developed by PathCheck Foundation.

### Description
> CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Palm Beach County, Florida, a diverse community of over a million and a half people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.

> The user interface needs help! I accidentally marked myself covid positive by clicking a tab, it have a warning that did not ask me if I was covid positive but instead asked if I wanted to upload my information. That is really unclear. I could find no way to undo this mistake. Reply to the response from the developer: At the time i reviewed it, the "3 step process" was definitely not a clearly defined clearly labeled 3 step process for marking yourself positive. Hopefully it has changed.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 04:39:13__

> I am in the homes of hundreds of people each day. I was in contact with at least 130 people who later tested positive. Apparently none of them had this app. Even if they had alerted positive, I would not had gone into quarantine or been tested because I have taken all of the necessary precautions and then some. I no longer see any reason to drain my battery for this app. It is past time to uninstall. 1,500,000 people in PBC. Less than 2,000 downloads = .001% using app. Useless<br> :date: __2020-10-05 16:02:29__

> PBC corrupt mayor and commission paid $800k for this turd app that violates all your rights to privacy, HIPPA, and ACA. $800k could hire a team of 8 top notch developers for a year! Investigate this fraud and the MaskGate fraud as well. When you get your mask in mail from PBC make sure to get a sharpy, write a message on it, and send back!

> Read the fine print of the user agreement VERY carefully! If you agree to it: you give up ALL of your rights. Advertised as not transmitting private information, yet it still has functionality to do so, and the agreement says they can whenever they want! Considering sensitivity of subject, potential for abuse, and waiving all rights in order to use this: one should avoid at all cost!

### Description
> Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. 
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple’s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. 
<br>Care19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.
<br>Care19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. 
<br> 
<br>The downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> MI COVID Alert is the COVID-19 exposure notification app supported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), in partnership with SpringML, Google, and Apple. This app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.
<br>Your personal use of MI COVID Alert helps inform others of possible exposure to COVID-19 if they are suspected of having been within close proximity to someone who has tested positive. When you download MI COVID Alert, you are helping your community stay ahead of any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. 
<br>How MI COVID Alert Works:
<br>Once downloaded, users of the app who have enabled it will exchange anonymous Bluetooth “keys” (random alpha-numeric codes that represent a Bluetooth signal) with other MI COVID Alert users.
<br>If someone reports that they tested positive for COVID-19, the app will search for other users who shared the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and MI COVID Alert estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Names of users and locations of possible exposure are never tracked and never shared.
<br>The BLE framework within MI COVID Alert will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate faster than other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running continuously.
<br>How MI COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>MDHHS takes your privacy very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within MI COVID Alert. 
<br>MDHHS and local public health staff follow up with persons who have a positive COVID-19 laboratory report. Public health will provide MI COVID Alert users with a validation pin. That validation pin must be entered into the app to report a notification of possible exposure to other users. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded MI COVID Alert. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for downloading MI COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, and communities.

Without this count the results are meaningless.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 17:03:53__

> I tested positive for COVID-19. I wanted to share it in the app so I could alert others. When you test positive, the DoH gives you a PIN that you then enter into the app to verify your positive test result, which should broadcast it on the app. But here's the major problem: it didn't recognize the TWO PINs they sent me. I tried phoning someone, but had no idea who to contact. I was desperate to get the word out, because I work in a busy location. Nothing worked. I tried the codes again and again, but the app kept rejecting them, saying that it wasn't a valid code. I called the admin office-- I think???-- of the local health department, because I had no idea who else to contact to help me. All I did was call the number the app gave me. No responses from anyone. I'm starting to think this is happening with other positive testers as well, and that's why exposures aren't properly updated. Because of this, this app is LITERALLY. POINTLESS. Please do something about this. I tried to inform as many people as possible, but I can't reach out to everyone.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 15:45:58__

### Description
> CombatCOVID MDC app is for Miami-Dade County coverage.
<br>CombatCOVID is the Official COVID-19 notification and information app of the County Government of Miami-Dade County, Florida, a diverse community of over 2.7 million people.
<br>Unlike other apps, CombatCOVID has never used GPS or location notification in its architecture. The app user’s privacy and identity are protected. No names, emails addresses, locations or personally identifying information is required. There is never any location or identity information acquired by CombatCOVID.
<br>The CombatCOVID app uses Bluetooth signals to determine if you are near another user. All users who have been in close proximity to a COVID-19 positive person will be notified by a push notification recommending they get tested immediately, without revealing anyone’s personal identity. Suggested locations for testing are also provided.
<br>Your device’s phone number is encrypted and never shared with anyone, including local health officials. All data and Information about the device being in close proximity with another device is ONLY stored on the device.
<br>Access to the data indicating the device’s user may have tested positive is only shared IF/WHEN the user chooses to share it. IF the user does choose to share a COVID-19 positive result, they are still totally PRIVACY PROTECTED.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Use the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app to anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result — and be anonymously notified of your own possible exposure to someone who later reports a positive COVID-19 test result — all without sharing anyone’s identity. The app protects your privacy while giving you the power to protect your health, your family’s and your community’s. 
<br> 
<br>Using the app is easy: 
<br>Step one: Download the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app and enable Bluetooth. 
<br>Step two: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you can choose to report it. Your test will be verified by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
<br>Step three: Those who may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days will be notified they were near someone with a positive test, but they won’t know who or where. Your identity and location remain completely anonymous, and your personal information isn’t disclosed, no matter what. 
<br> 
<br>Why it’s important 
<br>Stopping the spread of COVID-19 is essential to helping our communities, schools and businesses reopen and stay open. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers with the Alabama Department of Public Health will help notify those the person has been near — but they won’t know every person’s close contacts. The more people who use the app, the better the ability to notify those who have been exposed. 
<br> 
<br>How it works 
<br>When you are within about six feet of others, phones using the GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app exchange encrypted, anonymous codes via low-energy Bluetooth. If you test positive for COVID-19, those with whom you came in close contact — defined as within six feet for at least 15 minutes over the last 14 days — will get an anonymous notification that they were exposed. The notification they get is completely anonymous — they will not know who tested positive, the time, or the location — only the date of the possible exposure. 
<br> 
<br>Your privacy is our priority 
<br>The GuideSafe™ Exposure Notification app was developed by the Alabama Department of Public Health in cooperation with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and MotionMobs, using technology from a collaboration between Apple and Google. Users of the app exchange anonymous codes among their phones using Bluetooth — no location data is ever stored or exchanged, and your personal information is never shared.

### Description
> COVID Alert CT is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Connecticut. It is supported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT-DPH). COVID Alert CT helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the State and local health departments.
<br>Using COVID Alert CT is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively the app can help us to contain and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>Once you install and activate COVID Alert CT and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Phones will record the keys generated by other phones nearby with the app installed. The app will record the:
<br> -  signal strength, and use that  to estimate the distance between devices, 
<br> -  duration of the contact and 
<br> -  date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a COVID Alert CT user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code from a contact tracer at the State DPH or local health department. The code allows the user to activate the notification function in the app. You must use the verification code in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, and false exposure notifications. CT-DPH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>A positive report warns other app users that were near the infected person in the period close to the time when that person first experienced symptoms of the disease under certain circumstances. If the estimated distance was within six feet, the duration of exposure was at least 15 minutes cumulatively, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps.
<br>CT-DPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. There is no need for CT-DPH to know where or who you are, for COVID Alert CT to work.
<br>The Connecticut COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/COVIDAlertCT/PrivacyPolicy. The use of the app is limited to Connecticut and is subject to Connecticut law.
<br>Thank you for downloading COVID Alert CT. Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Connecticut moving forward.
<br>The app was developed using the Google / Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and CT-DPH.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | CT Department of Public Health |
| **Website**  | [http://ct.gov/covidalertct](http://ct.gov/covidalertct) |
| **Email** | DPH.covidalertct@ct.gov |
| **Physical address**  | [State of Connecticut Department of Public Health 410 Capital Avenue Hartford, CT,  06103](https://www.google.com/maps/search/State%20of%20Connecticut%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health%20410%20Capital%20Avenue%20Hartford,%20CT,%2006103) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7682186545769631479) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> I don't normally rate apps. Just looking through all the reviews and it's a shame that people ignorant to how the app actually works are leaving negative reviews. Download the app. Let it run. If you test positive, record it in the app. If someone else running this app tests positive and records it in the app, you will receive an alert (If you were near that person for more than 15min). Other than that, the app will silently run until something happens. It's not that hard to understand...<br> :date: __2021-04-20 18:02:46__

> Great idea in need of more widespread usage. I have no issue having my anonymous data help people I am in proximity with. I have not gotten any alerts, but I tend to not be out and about a lot during the pandemic so I'm probably less susceptible than many.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 23:57:00__

> THAT HOW I CUT TO NOW ABOUT THIS VIRUS<br> :date: __2021-03-07 20:00:17__

> The way I understand it, you only get notifications if an exposed person has downloaded this app and gives permission to share data. Those who have been exposed but saw no alert, the person may not have had this app. The app is only as accurate as the number of people using it; it's open-source data collection and completely voluntary. More residents should download this app.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:26:59__

> I'm not sure how to rate this app (see the XKCD comic on tornado warnings). I'm mostly reviewing to point out a SERIOUS flaw in the design of this app. I live on the border w/ NY. NY has it's own identical app. I can not run both apps at the same time. So I have to pick between CT or NY. What is the reason for this and why is this administered by the states at all? Why isn't there a national app?<br> :date: __2020-12-19 03:49:17__

> They should have a nation wide one not state by state<br> :date: __2020-12-19 01:29:15__

> Im not going to test this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 15:53:24__

> After deep diving the privacy claims of this app, I feel given it's a fully voluntary system that if you're concerned about covid-19 infection/spread, this app is a useful tool to protect yourself/loved ones while also contributing to the greater good by stopping the spread. Unlike other w reviews, I have had no noticable battery issues B-LE feature on my Note 9. Lost 1 star for some UX bugs I'm sure will be resolved soon.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 01:47:48__

> Impressive. I am impressed at the effort expended by the State of CT to ensure the safety of its residents, creating an app to track and notify exposure to the threat of a virus that kills approximately 1% of the population (not counting the elderly and those co-morbid), and at the same time continue with the virus-turned-political-weapon that is the COVID19/WUHAN virus. I recall an era when individuals whom presented a threat to the health of others were the ones quarantined. Ugh.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:16:10__

> I hope this updates with past exposures/past positive testers too since I just installed it & it's only providing new reports, of which it's currently empty. Also hope the Samsung Secure Folder installation glitch will be fixed soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 20:25:25__

> Bluetooth and location are always on. Significant battery drain. When a covid notification pops up, it does not take you to view that information. Rather you have to download the active app or you just get a spinning wheel.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 02:19:50__

> Easy to install, but I can't put a shortcut on my home screen. I have to search for it every time I want to open it. Everyone be safe.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 04:38:11__

### Description
> COVID Alert NJ App is being made available by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) to complement New Jersey’s comprehensive COVID-19 contact tracing effort. COVID Alert NJ is a free and secure mobile phone app that allows New Jerseyans:
<br>1.	To be alerted if they have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19 – even if that person is a stranger
<br>2.	To track their symptoms and get advice on what to do to protect themselves and others
<br>3.	To be able to anonymously warn other app users whom they were in close contact with, if they tested positive for COVID-19 – especially people they do not know or remember being in close contact with (e.g., during bus/train ride, at public places)
<br>4.	To monitor the latest information and statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic
<br>5.	To reach NJ public health representatives and be connected with support services 
<br>For all this to work, all you have to do is push “Allow” COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) on your phone within your App.
<br>You can also choose to “Allow” your phone to turn on the COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) and also “Allow” your phone to display notifications so that you also receive an alert that you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can also turn off this functionality, at any time, in the Settings page of the App. 
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you may read NJ DOH advice under Exposure Notification Information or get in touch with a public health representative.
<br>It is important to note that COVID Alert NJ will never reveal the identity of any person using the app to other app users, and never reveals who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New Jersey. Share this app with your friends and family.
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age, as they are considered not to have reached the digital age of consent or agreement with the State of New Jersey. You will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older after you download the App.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of New Jersey  Applications |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html](https://covid19.nj.gov/index.html) |
| **Email** | COVIDapp@doh.nj.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+New+Jersey++Applications](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+New+Jersey++Applications) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This is the official app of New York State, run by the NYS Department of Health as part of New York State’s comprehensive COVID-19 testing and contact tracing effort. The ultimate goal is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by:
<br>1. Alerting you if a sick person spends 10 mins or more within 6 feet of you, because this puts you at a higher risk of SARS CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. 
<br>2. Encouraging you to contribute to the health and safety of your friends, family and community by alerting others if you test positive, WITHOUT REVEALING YOUR IDENTITY TO ANYONE!
<br>3. Getting you important resources and help if you are exposed or test positive. You can call the COVID Alert NY Hotline or find helpful links to resources on next steps to protect your loved ones.
<br>4. Keep a private log of your own symptoms which can help your health care provider and public health representatives determine next steps.
<br>The app leverages a completely private and secure Bluetooth-based technology that Apple and Google developed. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been vetted extensively by privacy and security experts. We never see your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you. 
<br>Help us Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in New York.. Share this app with your friends and family so we can all be safer, together.

> It's a well designed app and is useful even if only for a convenient way to keep an eye on the charts. Of course the fact that it's opt-in is a limitation, but I really don't understand the complaints on this. People are saying they've never gotten an exposure notification like it's a bad thing. Are you sick with covid-19? If not, then what is the complaint exactly? You want false alarms?<br> :date: __2021-02-16 18:41:55__

> The app itself is fine. But the problem is the effectiveness of this app is limited by how few people install it. If you're the only person in town who has this app, it's useless. I've never received a notification from this app ever. I live in an area with almost 9% infection rate. I live in an apartment building and I've been out to supermarkets, etc. Not a single alert. As long as the app is not mandatory, it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 23:10:49__

> I have it installed. With such an allegedly important tool that could save life's it really is discouraging that it only relies 9n Bluetooth. Even a ping of data could provide enough location for triangular based location. Uninstalling, scientific based precautions will help. Not on a COB Job cell phone app, and also this is a lesson for the people of NY also. Common sense and caution will benefit not this. C<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:55:54__

> Kind of useless. Relies too much on self reporting, which doesn't tell me anything about my risk of exposure from others. If users who are diagnosed with COVID-19 don't self report, the need for this app becomes null. Also, if they don't have location services on, that also doesn't help at all.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 17:16:58__

> i dont understand why i cant change my country .When i opened the app it said that im in New York and that a have to choose where i live in new york and then when i tried to change there was only the option not in new york state. I want to know the cases in My country Bulgaria not in America rn.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 10:15:59__

> The App appears to have the right concept, but when it comes to what people want to use it for it irrelevant. If I use it I want it to tell me if my working location is safe, not to find out that it's only collecting information. To many cases are showing up around my job, and were finding out by people calling out. We need a tool that is more essential, with a Covid report button.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 03:35:34__

> Two stars because: It is a shame that only just over 100k people have downloaded this app in a city of 8.4 million and a state of 12 million.

### Description
> The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  
<br>The use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. You must be at least 18 years of age in order to accept these terms and use the App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you can only use this App if your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the use of the App on your behalf. A parent or legal guardian must confirm that you can use the App by consenting upon download and initial usage of the App. The App is not intended for use by children
<br>under the age of 13.,
<br>How the COVID Alert PA App works
<br>As opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.
<br>If an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. 
<br>Users who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.
<br>In the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. 
<br>It is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.

> Usable. But this app *could* be so much more.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:32:47__

> Meh... This app NEEDS an "I've been vaccinated" indicator and a way to store and prove vaccination information. Get on it.<br> :date: __2021-04-04 17:05:03__

> Covid-19, I know Corona Virus has changed all! I'm super disappointed in are system! China is swiping anal canal now! My only concern is, the ones with higher strang will probably be cloned in a robot! Biggest organ, Skinned perfectly put on Technology Robot. The real human to all but died of covid-19, to battle a working world for the humans that survived! At one time only one child. Wanting Boy. Afraid of the power of desperation! I know USA is a abarsement. President Trump, I believe in You<br> :date: __2021-03-09 11:08:59__

> Not what I expected, not the kind of information I was looking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 08:04:10__

> Now that there's a vaccine why don't you show where there's a vaccine. It's great that you have this app available and I've been using it for 10 months but can we pivot to showing where vaccines are or trying to help out with where that is? It's great finding out about all the problems with COVID but now that there's actually a solution available it'd be good to know where to find them instead of going to 50 different websites<br> :date: __2021-02-02 04:03:23__

> I suggest adding PA stats about vaccinations....as well as info on or even ability to make a vaccine appointment...and current phase status<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:24:51__

> Bad this app should notify those doctor to go and give those the vacinne that have fill the information out not have people out in large line and groups with this you have better control create job to new nursing school student to help in is fight<br> :date: __2021-01-21 07:21:53__

> Pros: It checks in everyday to review symptoms. It tells you information about what the rest of the app users symptoms were. It keeps up to date on what it is expected to. Con: I had my mom get Covid, and at the time I lived with her. I couldn't figure out how to report that since I tested negative. Not long after my family finished quarantine, my sister tested positive . I got tested again and was still negative, but technically I was exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:05:20__

> It says my exposure isd turned of but doesn't allow me to turn it on.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 04:53:18__

> It would be nice if there was a spot on the daily check in section of the app that had a CURRENT LOST OF SYMPTOMS. Just asking if you're okay or not doesn't help people to realize if they may have symptoms or not.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:21:29__

### Description
> MD COVID Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the Maryland Department of Health. The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by Maryland.
<br>Your personal use of MD COVID Alert will help anonymously alert Maryland residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable MD COVID Alert, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How MD COVID Alert works:
<br>When devices with MD COVID Alert are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the MD COVID Alert app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How MD COVID Alert Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Maryland takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. Maryland Department of Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for MD COVID Alert to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Maryland Department of Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, MD COVID ALert will verify positive tests and then provide MD COVID Alert users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. Maryland Department of Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the MD COVID Alert app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing MD COVID Alert! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Maryland moving forward!


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Maryland Department of Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | MDH.MDCOVIDAlert@maryland.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

Bluetooth was activated by app; assume i need to have it active when outside the house. Haven't been anywhere yet, so can't really evaluate app properly.

> This app would be better if it were more organized and personalized.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 01:57:57__

> Optional Use.. Would be great if this was Mandatory for everyone to download. Also, would everyone be honest about their Covid test results??. This app is a great blue print starter. But cant be relied upon.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 23:41:00__

> Conceptually the app is great. Practically it is of little utility. Make your own judgment. Consider how it operates and whether people not using the app or failing to report their health condition is an Achilles Heel.

Why trust the app if I have no idea if it is registering or missing the people I pass by? There aren't even numbers on how effective this app is for me or everyone in general.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 10:32:39__

> While I like this concept. I find this mainly a concept. There too many factors to consider before actually relying on this. First, is the person I'm walking pass have a similar application. Second, is the app properly set up. Third, has the person accurately and honest inputted their information. Fourth, is the app constantly working. And Sixth, will I receive information in a timely fashion in order to avoid contraction of COVID. If these things could be addressed then I would feel safer.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 20:14:24__

> I wanted to download to support but seeing the reviews and the lack of actual care in updating this app to be on par with neighboring state apps which are way more helpful... I used to use citizen to enable the covid alerts but they removed that feature from the app and decided to try the state app before searching for their tracer app. Way more comprehensive information and you don't need some code from the health department that apparently even the health department can't figure out.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 00:19:57__

### Description
> DC CAN is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for the District of Columbia in partnership with the Department of Health (DC Health). The app is an instance of Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DC Health.
<br>Your personal use of DC CAN will help anonymously alert DC residents who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable DC CAN, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community slow the spread of COVID-19.
<br>How DC CAN Works:
<br>When devices with DC CAN are in close contact, they exchange random identifiers using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When someone tells their app that they tested positive for COVID-19, whoever received their random identifiers may receive an alert that they may have possibly been exposed to COVID-19. When a device receives random identifiers it date-stamps them and records their signal strength so that the Exposure Notification system can estimate how close the two devices were to each other and for how long. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the DC CAN app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.
<br>How DC CAN Protects Your Privacy:
<br>DC Health takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Apple and Google's framework is designed to avoid correlating any personal data and location information with the random identifiers that devices exchange. DC Health does not want or need to know where or who you are for DC CAN to work. If you are close enough to another app user, your device's BLE will exchange random identifiers with that user.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to DC Health. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, DC Health will verify positive tests and then provide DC CAN users with a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. DC Health wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed Washington's DC CAN app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing DC CAN! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep DC moving forward!

While the app idea is decent and I hope more people turn it on when they go outside, the thing really, really needs to tone down the notifications.

> App installed fine. I disabled notifications in Virginia app first, installed DC app, but when I go back to VA app it says I can only have notifications turned on for one at a time. ... Knowing the two don't talk to each other, this situation is absolutely bonkers.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 06:57:32__

> In order to get this app to download, I had to uninstall VA's COVIDWISE app and re-install after the DC CAN app was installed (and then re-enable notifications for both apps once they were both installed). I'm sure this has something to do with androids security permission structure - but it was a little confusing (and I wouldn't have known to do it without reading another user's playstore review).<br> :date: __2020-10-20 18:40:04__

> don't know if it works yet, but Install problem. You need to DISABLE COVID notifications prior to install or it will not allow you to download through play store. This could occur if (like me) you have previously installed another state's COVID app and have enabled COVID notifications.

### Description
> SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>NCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?
<br>Step 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.
<br>Step 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. 
<br>Step 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.
<br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. 
<br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.
<br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?
<br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.
<br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.
<br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. 
<br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!

> Haven't used it very much.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 16:29:23__

> Nice idea, but way too few total downloads to make the app effective.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 22:56:49__

> Have recently uninstalled and then reinstalled this app. Seems to be working since I can see the date change from last check, but one problem, if this app has been downloaded by so many how is it that when I go to the store around a lot of people, there's no show that I may have been exposed. I'm pretty sure that majority of these people have the app, and care for others to turn it on correctly?.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 14:35:51__

> It's a good idea if that it would keep up to date. The last time mine checked in was back on December 24th 2020. My app is up to date also..<br> :date: __2021-02-26 16:30:10__

> App works well in theory. Tested positive and never was able to get my pin to report positive result. Now app no longer checking for notifications. Hasn't checked for any since January 2, 2021<br> :date: __2021-02-08 03:18:18__

> It was ok until the non-covid, personal question was dropped on me. I deleted the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 05:11:06__

> It isn't being used by everyone. So I was exposed by a nurse who was positive. I am immunosuppressed. I am a physician. I am around most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-26 05:50:29__

> I have a situation much like the previous commenter. My last check was January 12 and I have a google phone, I tried looking into the android setting to avoid snoozing but no luck. It would also be nice to have an in app feedback troubleshooting resource. Overall it's a good idea and keeps personal data safe<br> :date: __2021-01-23 18:46:57__

> None<br> :date: __2021-01-19 22:29:47__

> Slowcovidnc app need remove take down at this time not good<br> :date: __2021-02-26 15:10:22__

> Works fine. However, the last check was on January 14, 2021, which was six weeks ago.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 18:35:16__

> It would be cool if it actually checked. I've updated every time in hopes it would work, but it doesn't. Its a good idea, just not very well executed. Deleting now. After months and months of use and waiting for it to work right, it just doesn't.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 16:10:44__

> I am becoming increasingly disappointed with this app. It hasn't checked exposure since January 5th 2021, that's over 5 weeks ago. Seems a pointless app. I have been opening the app almost daily. And yes, it is the latest update according to the app store and it is on the do not sleep list. Even today, Feb 15th, the last exposure check was Jan 5th.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 14:25:51__

> This app used to update daily to show potential exposures. Here we are on Feb 1 and app last updated exposures on Jan 17. Perhaps funding ran out. I will be deleting this app. Update: Ultimately had to uninstall and reinstall. Will see if it updates regularly.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 15:24:09__

> I had the app for a few months, but I never got a notification. Either COVID didn't exist where I was, or people are not using the app properly. Looking at the other reviews I'm going to go with people aren't using the app properly with no fault of their own. If it's difficult to get a pin on the app then people will be less likely to log their positive results.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 17:45:33__

> Looked like it was working until last update. Now it says the last time it checked for exposure was December 26th, a month ago?<br> :date: __2021-01-25 13:31:44__

> I am confused. I was thinking this app would check for exposures on a routine basis but my last check was back in December and I see no way of manually requesting a check. Am I missing something??<br> :date: __2021-01-21 04:03:05__

> App is a peice of trash. Trying to sign up and use it is a pain in the butt. It shouldn't be this complicated to use an app that essentially only needs to notify you of other users around you. Many apps have this function. Hell, even dating apps notify you if a match is nearby. The devs need to learn how the hell to code an app before trying to capitalize on everyone's fear with this useless junk during a pandemic.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 15:13:12__

> Horrible and doesn't work at all. I am guessing the app developer is Slow, like the apps name. Google should remove this from the store. It does not look to be supported or updated any longer. Worst app I have ever downloaded!<br> :date: __2021-04-09 15:32:54__

> Statistics no longer working, back to political misrepresentation and hiding of details.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 15:00:45__

> The app is not working, it has not checked for exposure since January 9th. I keep seeing where they are telling people to go to Device Care > Battery ..... That does not exist on my phone, they must be giving instructions for an iPhone. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\** Update still is showing January 9th as my last exposure check. This app has not worked since then. I guess that I may as well uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 21:14:28__

> Stupid thing doesn't work. Someone has covid and two stores have been closed due to having covid 19. This app never alerted me I found out via facebook.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 22:21:55__

> Worthless. I have been in bed sick, sick with Covid for a week. Still tells me no exposures detected. Getting ready to remove it.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 17:28:50__

> I was positive with COVID. I was never able to enter results in this app. I was never contacted for contact tracing. I am an essential worker. This app is a tracking mechanism only and is NOT uses for COVID.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 12:30:11__

> Never contacted me!!!<br> :date: __2021-03-04 19:53:10__

> Exposure last checked on 2/8. It is now 2/28. Exactly what is the usefulness of that? I am using the latest update.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:57:53__

> UPDATE!! (""NOT RECOMMENDED"")!! don't download!! only trust the news on tv!! i would not trust these apps because i have heard on the real news that these could possibly be scams and there have been some reports that people did get scammed!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 05:10:59__

### Description
> CO Exposure Notifications is the official Exposure Notifications app of Colorado and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service. 
<br>CO Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.
<br>By enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you are within 6 feet of someone for at least 10 minutes, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you’ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you to a possible exposure. 
<br>If you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>To learn more, please visit https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications](https://covid19.colorado.gov/Exposure-notifications) |
| **Email** | CO_Exposure_Notifications@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Colorado+Department+of+Public+Health+%26+Environment) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 


## Mentioned servers

> Great information to have with so much going on its hard to keep up! This will make it a little bit easier!😊<br> :date: __2021-04-14 05:15:14__

> An essential app for public health. I received an exposure alert in November and it was very helpful. The bluetooth proximity sensor is a clever way to contact trace while maintaining privacy for users. I wish I could dismiss the "unable to check for exposures" alert that appears hourly if your bluetooth is off. I only have bluetooth on/exposure alerts enabled when I am at work around other people or out grocery shopping. When I am at home, alone, not doing anything or going out because there's a global pandemic, I wish this app would stop bugging me to turn on bluetooth. This was not previously an issue. I can understand this from a public health perspective- you want to avoid people forgetting to turn the app off. But really, the hourly reminders are very annoying and actually unnecessary for a lot of users.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 21:08:44__

> Dunno if there's anything I can reasonably say about it useful.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 03:03:37__

> Not sure if it works. Haven't received any notifications after nearly three weeks. There is likely not enough people using this app, and the ones who do use it also use masks and social distancing. It's the ones that don't (use masks, social distance or use this app) you gotta watch out for.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 07:25:48__

> It does work for sharing a positive result! But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 19:19:46__

> Haven't been able to get much info<br> :date: __2020-12-06 18:50:05__

> Called county health department to ask about notification & special code issue. RESULTS: 1) testing agency reports positive tests to the State 2) State notifies counties in which the positive people live 3) w/in 24 hrs, counties notify people who tested positive 4)w/in 48 hrs (cases are mounting),Contact Tracers call infected people & ask w/whom they have been in contact. NO REASON for infected people to need code. Call Labor Dept if there's a work issue. RECOMMEND: call people who know things.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:45:59__

> People have said they can't get a verification code that is needed to send an alert. I just read (11-18-20, cpr) that this code should now be sent automatically. Hopefully this improves the situation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 15:15:54__

> I can't specify my area nor can I put in a result whether I'm positive or negative. Need to understand what code they want. Also if it only sense through bluetooth I don't want to be that close to someone if possible. There should be more options in Android app. Couldn't get my iPad to gain access so not sure how others are getting info even if it may be places I may go in the Metro or suburb area. Clarification needed pr more options.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 03:31:37__

> How do you get a verification code?<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:46:52__

> I don't know what this app was supposed to do but so far it's done absolutely nothing regarding Covid-19 exposure. When I was exposed, it didn't alert me. When that exposure was reported to the local health department, it still didn't let me know. When I tried to manually update the app with exposure details ... well, that's not a feature so again I have to ask: what's this app supposed to do? Giving it two stars because I believe the intention was good but the execution was lackluster.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 00:41:30__

> Used to only notify you once about bluetooth, now does it all the time. That incentivizes me to uninstall since you cannot turn that notification off. Unfortunate.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 04:36:52__

> Confusing app. When you go to notify the app you have covid it prompts you to enter a notification code. But the text message you receive doesn't contain a code, but a link you click on and follow prompts. The text I got after testing positive came 2 days later and was in a spam folder (I didn't know my phone filtered suspected spam). So I kept thinking I didn't have the verification code & contacted CDPHE several times to no avail. They should email the info too & have an FAQ on the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 19:43:17__

> This app doesn't work. I installed it when it first became available. It has never once in all that time reported an exposure regardless of how remote the exposure might be.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 23:39:55__

> The app seems great (simple, unobtrusive, easy to use, no major privacy issues) but what good is the app if people can't easily report their covid results? Why haven't they partnered with testing facilities to provide this code automatically upon getting a positive result?

Maybe I'm just ridiculously lucky to have avoided all exposure, but between case numbers, quarantines in my workplace, people not receiving positivity codes, and codes going unused, it seems much more likely that this app doesn't work well in practice.

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I have been using the app since it was first released and have been happy with it's simplicity and the various articles are interesting and give a lot of insight. I am however, unhappy that despite having the latest version installed I have not been asked about my vaccinations but if I create a new profile the vaccine questions are there but then I lose all the data history I have provided.

> Apparently I'm supposed to be able to log my vaccine on here. Still have not worked out how. Can ask other people log their vaccine, but no idea how to log my own. Very frustrating. I've checked I've got the latest version, I'm pretty tech savvy but still no idea. Given up.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 08:49:24__

> 547 MB of storage used!? This should be such a simple little app!<br> :date: __2021-04-04 15:00:35__

> Still a blank white space where the graphs should be: there were no issues for a long time, then suddenly one day they vanished! All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis & 'Share the graph', nothing else: you can't share what you can't see. No explanation given. Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe a good while back, they acknowledged the problem...but nothing. It is a good app, but I do wish they would take the trouble to sort it out.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 11:56:57__

> Recent update broke ability to view results because date of birth can't be changed from year 2001. Will revise review when fixed. Update: the developers instruction does fix the DOB entry problem but it really should not be so complicated. The previous DOB interface was frustrating as well but it did work. Not sure why it is so complicated. Upgrading to three stars as most people still won't be able to figure out the DOB trick.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 17:08:49__

### Description
> Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. 
<br>Designed by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. 
<br>In these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>Note that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.
<br>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>This app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
<br>This temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. 
<br>For more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> PathCheck (formerly COVID Safe Paths) can privately save the places you visit and store them on your phone. Subscribe to Healthcare Authorities in your area for information about COVID-19 near you, where available. 
<br>Receive alerts from your local Healthcare Authority with information about potential exposure to COVID-19.
<br>We are a global movement to develop free, open-source, privacy-by-design tools for residents, public health officials, and larger communities.
<br>The PathCheck program has spun out of initial privacy-first research conducted by MIT and TripleBlind, into a newly created non-profit called PathCheck Foundation, established with the initial purpose of supporting global rollout of the PathCheck app and associated tools for contact tracers and healthcare authorities. 
<br>The goal of PathCheck is to help enable the reemergence and re-opening of economies and communities.  Through global partnerships, we are prepared to support public health officials everywhere in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pretty neat!<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:06:41__

> Waa answered quickly.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 00:42:16__

> Seems buggy It worked fine for few days then stopped working. Reloaded changed password still getting era message.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 01:03:24__

> Quick and painless, although a little buggy. Sometimes it struggles to sign me in, and when I try to save a doctor's note it just crashes. Otherwise incredibly helpful, especially now.<br> :date: __2020-09-08 01:20:22__

> Nice way to obtain health concern with an MD :)<br> :date: __2020-06-12 20:01:23__

> This application is very interactive for symptom check. Only issue my grandma found is she was not able to login back with her finger print after logging out. She was so keen about it because she did not want to remember her credentials.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 02:17:19__

> Was very accurate in the information. Really helped me a lot.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 06:26:53__

> Yahoo<br> :date: __2020-04-10 21:02:26__

> This would be better if the doctors were instantly available. There will be hours and hours of waiting and reconnecting and retrying and re-launching the app. I did get to meet with a doctor twice. Once they looked at me, and the next time they actually called in a prescription to my local pharmacy for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 17:31:05__

> Haven't had it yet.<br> :date: __2020-04-30 09:01:44__

> I loved this app when it worked! Now it keeps crashing. Every time I open it, it freezes and nothing shows up. I tried to see if there was an update but there's not :(<br> :date: __2020-04-09 11:09:00__

> Impossible to use, this app crashes right when you get to the section that asks you questions. I've tried two different devices with the same result on each. Update, the related issue was fixed so I've updated my rating. This app still needs a better user experience, so 3 stars now.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:39:51__

> Doesn't recognize my symptoms to suggest correct treatment. Additionally you are only providing two genders. There should be an option for gender fluid and non binary and the respective pronouns.<br> :date: __2019-10-11 21:02:53__

> No visit history, no insurance info saved after forced app update. All lost. Repeated requests to login after successful previous logins moments ago.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 08:31:59__

> Initial wait to speak with a doctor was 1 hour, which I honestly didn't mind considering the current world events. What really irritated me was the actual chat with the doctor. It took 3.5 hours mostly because the doctor took between 10-15 minutes to respond to me. I believe the longest I waited for him to respond was 30 minutes. On top of all that, I was told he wasn't currently able to provide a doctor's note due to current limitations within the app. Waste of money and time.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:56:02__

> Clunky, confusing setup process. There is a lot of configuration of personal settings even after connecting to the main Sydney health app and my Anthem account. Once you have it set, it still makes you go through the symptom checker before you can use its touted features for communicating with medical experts. Even that might be workable, but there are huge gaps in the symptom checker. I can't start with hypertension or high blood pressure as a symptom? Terrible, frustrating design.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:19:48__

> Think I have Covid but private healthcare is a fail. Horrible App (and somehow I pay for this experience). I have anthem blue cross blue shield and their sydney care app to figure out the covid testing I need with symptoms is a fail. Tries to link accounts but won't login and the reset password doesn't work to the email on file or phone. I can login to their other sydney app just fine. This sydney business has been a wreck since they sought to disconnect it from the name of the provider.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:54:25__

> It will not allow me to get any info over to my work. Will not allow me to download my doctor visit information to my phone or fax it to my work or email to my HR department.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:15:41__

> I have to answer the same questions every time I log in. It doesn't pick up where we left off.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 13:32:00__

> Dumb app does not work!! You can not get passed the login!<br> :date: __2020-09-07 02:37:52__

> App crashes more than all Nascar drivers together. Cant even download an attachment referral. Also have to sign in 8 times just to send one message because it crashes then requires login credentials. Fought with this app for 60 min before I told the doctor to just cancel everything we discussed and I was uninstalling this piece of trash crash app.<br> :date: __2020-09-03 18:39:31__

> Dont download. Cant put in code to register<br> :date: __2020-08-29 17:27:15__

> Keeps going back to main menu, no matter if I try to link it and login with my Sydney health info or try making a new account. There is no in-app chat or trouble shooting. Basically it's impossible to use. I have had this insurance plan for a year and a half and have tried using this"resource" multiple times. I have a doctorate, and my husband literally writes computer code for a living so this is not user error. If he and I can't figure out how to make it work, it just doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-08-12 16:03:30__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Doctor On Demand, Inc |
| **Website**  | [http://www.doctorondemand.com/contact](http://www.doctorondemand.com/contact) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quick and efficient<br> :date: __2021-04-18 05:52:32__

> Traci was so compassionate and took time with us, made us feel like we were her only priority when my son was ill. I love using Dr. On Demand and not having to go into a clinic if it's not needed.

> I don't have insurance because I can't afford it and Doctor on Demand is very expensive.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 18:21:55__

> The doctor was fine, but the audio was atrocious. Turns out you have to manually tell the app to switch to headphones from speaker even with wireless or wired headphones active on your device. I didn't figure this out until the end of the call. That is some backwards technology.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 16:05:41__

> Setting up an appointment is easy and the mobile app is straightforward, but my counseling session left me feeling worse than I did before it! My therapist seemed very irritated right from the start. She maintained composure but seemed impatient and distracted throughout the session, which she ended 20 min early, without warning. I feel scammed, at least my insurance is covering it. So much for virtual therapy.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 18:43:22__

> Awesome service, but it has major caveats. If you need individual help for something like a soar throat it's great. But if you have kids, and all three have the same sickness, you have to call in three times, pay three times, and potentially get three different treatments for the same problem. My kids had impetigo, same symptoms - one got one oral antibiotic, the other got a different oral antibiotic, and the third got a topical. This is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 14:49:10__

> Appointments and medical advice are great. Customer service is not. Something as simple as getting a form to a doctor you see can take weeks.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 15:07:39__

> Easy and convenient when it it work's out, the last two appointments were missed, the first because I could not get into the video chat and they put me down as a no show, the other time was today, I was in the app waiting for the appointment to start when I noticed the date was changed to tomorrow when I work, now I have to Waite till next month to see the doctor.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 22:07:09__

> I loved the doctor. Attempting to access my appointment PRIOR was HELL. No where on your app so you explain how the app works. The video you provide "What you can expect on your first visit" was hogwash. It did NOT explain anything at all. Appreciated the care but the app is NOT user friendly.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 17:47:59__

> \*\*\*\* PLEASE PLEASE, try not to use this kind of app unless u really need it. These kind of apps can fail you when you run need. Customers from all over the US are needed services. W/Limited workers u may not get your prescription or referral u need. Research these types of apps. Also If u google doctors help/assistance u'll get a wide variety. Some W/800 #. I've had mix results, but after using different aspects of these services I understand the limitations. I hope this helps you.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 21:53:16__

> Very poor technical platform. First appointment doctor drop the call because coul not hear. Second appointment doctor explained they hear feedback because of platform<br> :date: __2021-03-09 15:17:35__

> Ive used yhis app 3 times. 2 of the times they didnt fulfill the papeework requirement i had to return ti work. Which makes you have to go back a 2nd time. Last time took 5 wks for them to get a pi release for me to give dr and they never contacted him to sign paperwork. lost the job.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 00:50:25__

> The consulting service itself is great, and the doctors have been both helpful and professional, but the app/service restricting the ability to make appointments based on your current location and not the location where you'll have returned to in... I don't know... 5 weeks' time when the appointment ACTUALLY is scheduled is more than a little frustrating. Not only that, booking on a PC isn't allowed without camera access. Except I don't have a camera installed on this PC, and I don't intend to use it for the appointment. App developers, please consider that the devices and locations used during the appointment booking process may not reflect those used at the time of service and be more flexible. Show a warning: "This doctor is not licensed in your current state. Please ensure you have returned to your state of residence at the time of your appointment." or perhaps "Please note that this service will require camera access at the time of your appointment." These restrictions should only apply at the time of service. What's to stop me from booking an appointment in the correct state and on a device with a webcam, only to lack both of those at or near the time of the appointment? THAT'S the issue you need to address. Not the arbitrary one you're creating for your users. Overall, it's a good service with a restricted app and website that don't even necessarily address the issues for which they've made the app/website so restrictive.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 18:27:12__

> I am a technically challenged senior and want to learn how to communicate in solitary confinement amongst a community of fearful russians and Hispanics who are involved in drug deals living nearby. I am in need of medical services and everybody has been using my personal information to steal from me and my family members because there are cyborthieves that got into my account from the dark web.

> Horrible Customer service & Negligent care providers. Do yourself a favor and use another Telemedicine service. I was seeking assistance for 4 days. Not only did it take them days to answer messages. When they did I received the same unhelpful response as I did on the phone. Oh well we sent the request to the doctor . The request? He took me off work and failed to give me a note as promised during the visit. IT WAS HIS IDEA 💡. Oh and he won't be back until April 12th!<br> :date: __2021-04-06 19:36:54__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | WebMD, LLC |
| **Website**  | [http://www.webmd.com](http://www.webmd.com) |
| **Email** | android@webmd.net |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great info. Use as a medical info on or after receiving new meds and visits to Dr.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 20:52:12__

> Great health info. My only gripe is the reminder section. I take various medications and have it listed on the reminder section, however you have to select each medication individually to mark it as taken. I wish there was a way to select all at once. Maybe create a group of medications. The medication database is not extensive but have most common ones.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 17:39:18__

> Very useful app! The symptom tracker is very informational. I use their petmd app also. Great job developers !!<br> :date: __2020-09-29 04:22:11__

> Bladder spasms<br> :date: __2020-08-14 04:39:41__

> It gives good explanations I can understand. Its not medical advice per-say, its more like an educational tool that helps me make better decisions with my health issues plus if I require a doctor visit I know enough to ask the right questions. For me, educating myself enough gives me the knowledge to know I'm being referred to the right specialist. Saves time and less money wasted on copays<br> :date: __2020-07-25 01:54:21__

> I liked the info, but I could really use the medication reminder. Unfortunately, it only works if I open the app first. That makes it useless.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 05:39:19__

> I rarely use this App.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 19:25:04__

> I like the option to add current medications and conditions with the symptom checker, but the majority of my medications and diagnosis don't come up when I write them in the search box so I'm not sure how reliable that feature is, or the app as a whole (though we know it's not meant for a medical diagnosis).<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:25:54__

> This is a decent medical app good for simple medical issues. I found it doesn't work for me having multiple medical issues. It could use a place to enter actual lab results to help with the diagnosis.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 09:03:23__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | State of Colorado - Governor's Office of IT |
| **Website**  | [http://myColorado.state.co.us](http://myColorado.state.co.us) |
| **Email** | myColorado@state.co.us |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=State+of+Colorado+-+Governor's+Office+of+IT) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I saw other comments about the digital ID not recognizing them the same day they went to the DMV. I gave it a try after I went in yesterday and got the same error message as everyone else. I gave it another try today and it worked! Looks like it takes a bit of time for their system to update, which is understandable. A government app that kinda works... what a nice surprise! 4 stars!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:33:45__

> I finally got the app to work for me. The devs should really make this app less difficult to use.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 09:38:45__

> Awesome.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 14:37:05__

> Handy app. But why is the CCW permit not included? All other Colorado ID is.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 15:18:52__

> Great App! But, periodically wont let me log in.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 00:38:49__

> Needs to be able to add antique vehicles. Can't seem to add vehicles with Horseless Carriage plates.<br> :date: __2021-04-05 18:10:09__

> As a web/app developer myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use. The UI/UX is solid. The digital ID works perfectly.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 23:30:04__

> Works well. Good list of resourses<br> :date: __2021-02-21 23:45:41__

> Very innovative app, works way better than when fist released. I do have two issues with the app. 1) The login process is required too many times and can be a tedious & lengthy process. Often verification code needs to be resent more than once. 2) Many businesses do not accept the digital ID due them not having a compatible POS - so they can't scan it. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about that ID is by far the biggest flaw. Awareness by the businesses needs to be ramped up.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 15:50:58__

> Very practical<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:31:00__

> In all honesty the quality,functionality, clarity, ease of use is brilliant the app is amazing and will be worth 5 stars when it is accepted as a real ID. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is not accepted for identity validation for investment platforms.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 00:42:03__

> 2 factor authentication not working. I've been waiting for 15 mins for the code to be text to me so I can buy a lighter and nothing! It's a waste of energy. ---Sure, thanks for the acknowledgement. 👍When this app is working, its amazing.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 05:22:11__

> Terrible third-party software for text verification and face ID.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 02:33:43__

> The app says I have no internet connection. Eventhough I am connected to wi-fi or cellar. When toggling my wi-fi off then on, when the app is open, it crashes. Also, when trying to open the insurance cards, the app crashes. I believe it is due to Lookout security app safe browsing VPN. When this service is disabled, the app is able to connect. I believe this app should work with lookout security app where I'm not forced to disable it if I want to use this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:30:27__

> MyColorado app failed. Ever since the app was updated, the insurance cards portion doesn't open the document and once you click to open it the app crashes on all my phone's and tablet. Please update this to fix the insurance card portion.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 03:49:21__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | support@americanwell.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Dr. Gindy is an amazing Physician<br> :date: __2021-04-21 18:31:23__

> I've used this twice and had wonderful experiences, quick, efficient and knowledgeable doctors. Way better than driving to and waiting at an urgent care. Plus it saves your information so you don't have to re-enter in all of your insurance and all that stuff every time you use it. I hate all those forms at the doctor's office.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 04:43:47__

> I've used amwell a few times. I've gotten great advice, and been treated with utmost respect by the Dr's that have seen me. Thank you Amwell!<br> :date: __2021-04-18 20:43:04__

> Quick useful service<br> :date: __2021-04-25 20:48:16__

> Pretty straightforward. Make sure to have a good wifi connection. Unfortunately where I live, we don't have great internet.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 17:30:33__

> Questions after ER Muscle spasms, severe pain, numbness.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:10:21__

> The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 21:04:16__

> I had sprained my ankle really bad and I didn't think I needed to go to a hospital and risk getting Covid. The doctor was great very informative and answered all my questions. The downside is the app has a section for emailing your doctor and the one I selected did not receive them. That information should of been on the description of the doctor. I also needed a doctors note she said she'd get it but forgot. Contacted support multiple times till after almost 2 days I got my doctors note.<br> :date: __2020-09-30 00:53:59__

> Dr responded at midnite. Ordered antibiotics. Able to avoid ER or acute care to possibly be exposed to Covid-19.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 05:54:30__

> Always updating, frequently have trouble with app, video connection pretty poor.<br> :date: __2020-03-22 15:54:59__

> I'm sorry I only gave you a three but when I am promised paperwork on a Friday and don't get it there's something wrong you got what you wanted from me but yet I don't get anything from you I know it's busy but I need my paperwork that's all I'm saying You're a little slow getting paperwork to your patients or your emails I wish your daughters were a little more reliable when it comes to sending paperwork<br> :date: __2020-03-16 04:33:01__

> not happy Dr never called me back my whole head was swollen and I needed antibiotics for an abscessed tooth didn't get them<br> :date: __2020-03-05 19:02:19__

> I have been having a great experience with both the app and Amwell services. It has been a god-send for me for many reasons. I am very grateful my insurance has teamed up with Amwell. However, as time went on I discovered the billing dept really sucks! I had appts scheduled and when I logged in I found that I suddenly had to pay for the visit out of my pocket, but my insurance covers it 100%. I was expected to pay for it and be reimbursed by my insurance. Like I have $80 just sitting around.<br> :date: __2019-11-13 14:10:22__

> Need to use it more. It's a good starting point.<br> :date: __2019-10-25 18:44:01__

> Its good but every tine i log in it makes me reenter my cridit card number.<br> :date: __2019-09-20 01:59:16__

> The look of the app is almost exactly the same as LiveHealth Online Mobile. Has WAY more insurance providers... But still can't find anywhere that will accept Pan America Life insurance. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2019-08-15 04:50:44__

> Disappointed off the bat. was sent an email from uhc to click and register to get an amazon gift card for registering. nada. its a good idea for doctors... help people out by making it cheaper and more accessible during the times of day when people actually get sick. so 3 stars.<br> :date: __2019-05-25 22:29:37__

> 1 doctor online and 8 people in line.<br> :date: __2019-04-03 12:16:45__

> Not impressed. The doctor was nice enough. felt very rushed. Diagnosed pink eye but had an issue with my prescription and no way to follow up on it. Probably wont use again.<br> :date: __2019-03-23 17:12:25__

> The app was good, dr was friendly. Just an ear infection i wanted some meds. Doctor said i should go to in person urgent care. Then why did the hell did i waste 80$ and use amwell?????<br> :date: __2021-03-21 17:41:06__

> The app and service is great, as long as you're paying. I didn't need to continue using the service so I canceled after talking to the doctor and getting the help I needed. However, the pharmacy didn't get my prescription order, and Amwell support refuses to give it to me unless I start my membership again. That seems shady to me. I paid for a service and received it, but didn't get to retrieve the solution (prescription), which was the reason I signed up in the first place.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:19:05__

> Basically an app to purchase a doctors note for work or school. The doctors or nurse practitioners seem terrified to write any prescription that isn't OTC. I deleted it.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 17:44:50__

> So frustrating to use. Never works right and I get over charged.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 22:35:46__

> The service is a great idea and fast. But the app will not allow pictures to be uploaded forcing a video visit. Once they get that fixed, it will be great.<br> :date: __2020-08-28 15:18:06__

> Video of my doctor was not good, nor was the audio with the doctor, we resorted to a phone call for the audio portion. I have been using " Doxy me " for other doctor visits and it works much better.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 19:12:11__

> Not the biggest fan, my insurance wasn't found but the company was listed.<br> :date: __2020-05-02 17:23:27__

> Waited with 11 people ahead of me, only to get to the front, wait another half hour, and then be transferred to someone else, only to be pushed back in the queue even more. When I got to the front of that person's queue, after 15 minutes the app forcefully logged me out! I feel terrible and this was 4.5 hours of my time wasted! Not cool! I really need to see someone.<br> :date: __2020-03-29 03:24:08__

> First visit for my son went great. Doctor was friendly and listened and helpful. Second visit was for me. The doctor couldn't even work his camera correctly so all you could see was the top of his head. He then was very condescending. He didn't even know about one of the medications I was taking (it's used off label for my treatment). He kept insisting it's never used for that I must take it for something else. 🙄 You can't go back to file a complaint.<br> :date: __2020-01-24 11:24:41__

> Don't be surprised that the app doesn't work just when you need it. Today is Sunday and just when I need it, it is not working. Not very 24/7.<br> :date: __2020-01-13 06:46:21__

> When the app opens it now says that their services are not available in my state of Florida. But it is available....just for 'better insurance' such as Blue Cross Blue shield and the like.<br> :date: __2021-04-20 23:42:21__

> Not used<br> :date: __2021-04-19 05:04:06__

> App keeps crashing. I need to see my therapist. This sucks. What if someone was snowballing into a crisis situation and needed to talk? I'm pretty annoyed.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 13:28:51__

> Every update makes the app worse. Can't find insurance, can't see or hear doctor, can't leave doctor reviews anymore, doctors seem to be rood a lot. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:49:08__

> Doc canceled video chat mid meeting w/o reason-she couldn't be seen or heard at 1st, then I could barely her even tho my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G was on the highest volume. She said she was typing so she couldn't turn on the camera at the same time. Mina Rizwan was found under Women's Health and her profile stated it is her profession. I had uploaded images of my health report since I was looking for a 2nd opinion, all she told me was to go to my OBGYN n hung up on me. POINTLESS APP!RUDE DOCTOR!<br> :date: __2021-04-03 18:17:37__

> Doesn't have healthfirst so beware.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 09:51:03__

> I HATE THIS APP!! It constantly crashes, won't load, or won't even stay open. I got kicked out of another appointment and that's not good. Especially for people who are paying their hard earned money for the services provided. Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 20:12:02__

> Got someone who allegedly graduated from NYU School of Med, but had no idea bacteria grew in the large intestine. Not even exaggerating this. Don't use this app unless you have no other options. I'd better not be charged the copay for this.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 02:15:31__

> Sucks<br> :date: __2021-02-27 22:23:22__

> Uninstalled immediately after the signup page. I am a trans person who came across their services recommended as being LGBTQ+ friendly but the app has a signup form with no options for gender other than male/female, and no option for a social name. This tells me everything I need to know about how I might be treated. Terrible.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 17:43:38__

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Tech said the app should "just work" even after I let them know it didn't. Since tech support was not supportive, I decided to dig into it myself. I found the permissions the app needed were not all allowed. Finally got the app working after manually allowing the camera and microphone. Seems like something tech support should have thought to suggest.<br> :date: __2020-02-11 20:07:56__

> I can't leave the app while I'm waiting for the visit or it will take me off the wait list. So I had to wait an hour without access to my phone. Also tried doing my visit on the computer but it wouldn't let me continue without allowing access to my camera and microphone, but the website never asked for that permission so I was never able to give permission, and google doesn't let you manually give permission without the site asking. Incredibly annoying, and required even after I was covid free.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:06:13__

### Description
> Take 30 seconds every day to fight COVID-19. Your daily health check-ins help doctors and scientists anticipate the next outbreak and get ahead of the coronavirus. The first time you download the app and share how you feel, we’ll donate a meal to people in need through Feeding America.
<br>The How We Feel app only asks you to self-report age, gender, postal code and any health symptoms you’re experiencing. It does not ask you to sign in with your name, phone number or email address. The data is securely shared with select scientists, doctors and public health professionals who are actively working to stop the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>The How We Feel app was built by an independent, nonprofit organization called The How We Feel Project. Our organization was founded by a volunteer team of scientists, public health researchers and technologists. Our mission is to make the world healthier by connecting citizens with the global health and research community. The organization was created in March, 2020 to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br>We are proud to be working with scientists, doctors and public health professionals from leading institutions including McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the Weizmann Institute of Science.
<br>We are collaborating with Dr. Gary King from Harvard University’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science’s Privacy Insights Project. Dr. King specializes in developing technologies to make data available to researchers while protecting participants’ individual identities.
<br>Our technology team includes Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest and a volunteer group of current and former Pinterest employees.

| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It is basic and alliws me to provide a rough description of my health status. But does not allow for individual or personal answers. Not everyone fits into the options provided. Example. I select cough every day. But would like a personalized option of explaining that it is medication induced.the choices are a bit too constraining.

> UPDATE: From 10/5 - 11/20/20+ the App didn't work at all. Since some time in 01/2021 I've been able to start doing daily check in's again. However, this past week 3/26 my state's info has not been showing. It just show's "ERROR LOADING CARD". EDIT: It's now 4/20/21 & the "error loading card" has STILL not been fixed! Changing to 2 stars until fixed! I'm really hoping it doesn't take 4ever for the Co. to fix this problem; like it did when they crashed the App w/ their "update" back on 10/5/20.<br> :date: __2021-04-20 08:38:30__

> I enjoy helping in this way. It also brings an awareness of our health and a reminder to follow the Guidelines. Gov Baker advised people should be getting out, enjoying a short ride or walking to the park. Not sure where this app went.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 07:29:02__

> Is the app still useful???? Since a week ago, I don't receive the information of how many people are not feeling well, and the number that are good is really low!! So I became to doubt about the information is true. Also, if this app is really useful for medical purposes you're missing the people with asthma and high blood pressure. Hope to improve the app, or is it the time to delete it?? Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 15:26:38__

> Update broke the app. Unable to open.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 13:37:49__

> Felt like I was contributing to tracking COVID 19 but then there were questions about my emotional health which I felt had nothing to do with tracking the virus.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 05:26:07__

> Removing some stars for the new update since the app now crashes on launch every time, so I'm no longer able to use. Once this is resolved I'll go back to 5 stars<br> :date: __2020-10-15 22:10:27__

> Stopped working. I had checked in for 5 months.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:42:43__

> Since latest update on 10/5/2020, app consistently has glitches, won't open<br> :date: __2020-10-11 18:06:42__

> App was great - just started crashing 2 days ago and keeps failing. Sent an error report to Google but not sure what's going on.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 05:39:36__

> App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 06:06:13__

> The app stopped working<br> :date: __2020-12-24 23:47:41__

> When I first download this I was super excited to see how this app works. Turns out is does not work at all. When you open the app all it says is app is not responding please open app again or close app. I tried to open the app again and it says the same thing every time. What a waste of time, don't get this app unless you want to waste your time.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:13:43__

> The app will not run on my Galaxy S 10+. It cones up and stops within a second or 2. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multple times.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 14:14:54__

> Update sucks, can no longer scroll through numbers from past dates. Numbers for total cases and icu cases are often wrong showing the same digits for both categories.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 07:37:52__

> Doesn't work anymore. Don't know why. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, still doesn't work!<br> :date: __2020-11-22 16:25:11__

> I've responded 175 times since downloading. After the last update the app wont open at all. I also fond the data dashboard they provide me to be confusing and sometimes contradictory to what is happening in the news. They also provide old content/tips for multiple days. This should be updated daily if they want me to respond daily.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 15:09:08__

> App has stopped working<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:37:32__

> 10/26/20 Have not been able to open app in weeks. Was really good. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. 11/16/20 app still doesn't open. You are missing a good chunk of reporting by the looks of the recent reviews.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 16:15:39__

> Ever since the last update, I can't use the app. It crashes every time I try to open it<br> :date: __2020-11-14 09:45:23__

### Description
> HealthTap gives you 24/7 access to top U.S. board-certified doctors with or without insurance.
<br>Two ways to tap in:
<br>HealthTap Prime. For a $15 monthly membership fee, you get:
<br>• Urgent Care visits, just $30 each. Available 24/7. For time-sensitive issues like fever, stomach pain, or dizziness. Connects you with a doctor in one minute or less.
<br>• Primary Care visits, just $40 each. Choose your doctor, see the same doctor for subsequent visits, and book appointments online. For ongoing preventative medicine and managing chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension.
<br>For use without insurance. HealthTap Basic:
<br>• Urgent Care visits for $80 each or a copay. Copay amount depends on the insurance plan. Many plans cover 100%.
<br>Primary Care is currently not available through HealthTap Basic.
<br>HealthTap doctors can diagnose and treat you and your family when you’re ill or have a health concern. They can send medically necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy, order lab tests, and recommend specialists if you need ongoing care. After your doctor visit, you will get a treatment plan with easy-to-follow instructions and reminders to help you stay on track.
<br>IMPORTANT: Just like with in-person doctors, getting a prescription depends on many things. For example, your doctor might refill your antidepressant prescription in an Urgent Care visit, but they’re unlikely to start you on a new drug. For managing ongoing conditions, it’s best to start seeing a Primary Care doctor on HealthTap who can get to know you and your medical history.
<br>There are some medications that telemedicine providers, including HealthTap doctors, rarely if ever prescribe or refill. These medications are nearly always prescribed in-person.
<br>Below is a sample list of medications HealthTap doctors cannot prescribe. The list uses brand brand and generic names based on what’s best known to consumers.
<br>Opioids and other controlled substances like:
<br>Adderall
<br>Ativan
<br>Norco
<br>oxycodone
<br>Valium
<br>Xanax
<br>Psychiatric drugs like:
<br>Abilify
<br>gabapentin
<br>lithium
<br>Lifestyle drugs like:
<br>Chantix
<br>Contrave
<br>Qsymia
<br>In addition to seeing a doctor anytime, with HealthTap you can:
<br>1. ASSESS your symptoms with our artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker
<br>2. SEARCH our library of patient-asked, doctor-answered medical questions
<br>3, ASK written questions and get personalized, doctor-written answers in 24 hours or less
<br>HealthTap will build your health dossier and store all your data in one place. This includes medical treatments, prescriptions, labs, wearable devices, and doctor visit notes — and it all works together to provide a more personalized experience.
<br>100% SECURE & CONFIDENTIAL
<br>We take your privacy very seriously. Your visit with the doctor is confidential and HIPAA compliant.
<br>What people are saying
<br>PC Magazine - "The next time you have a medical question… try asking the doctors on HealthTap."
<br>*Virtual doctor visits currently not available for people in Alaska and Idaho
<br>Copyright © 2020 HealthTap, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
<br>HealthTap may not be available in certain states and is subject to state regulations. HealthTap does not replace the primary care physician, is not an insurance product, and may not be able to substitute for traditional in-person care in every case or for every condition.
<br>HealthTap does not guarantee patients will receive a prescription, does not prescribe DEA controlled substances and may not prescribe non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HealthTap |
| **Website**  | [https://www.healthtap.com/](https://www.healthtap.com/) |
| **Email** | support@healthtap.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Symptom checker need further enhancement<br> :date: __2018-10-14 16:27:26__

> Full of bugs in new version, I can't open my notifications, I can't see my questions. Another thing is that you ask a simple yes or no question but the doctors answer something else.<br> :date: __2018-09-07 23:00:52__

> As much as I like this service since it keeps me from needing to go to a 
doctor's office, it needs work. I have done two consults now as a Prime 
member. My prescriptions were not actually called in on either one, 
resulting in extra time and visits needed at my pharmacies.<br> :date: __2018-08-03 15:34:35__

> Couldn't get to the unattended FAQ/Troubleshooting without obligations. Uninstalled<br> :date: __2021-02-28 04:50:42__

> We downloaded this app one VERY busy week ...my daughters middle finger had gotten infected due to the several open areas she has because of eczema. The doctor we spoke to on the app seemed to think that going to the ER for IV antibiotics was the only thing that would help her. So we headed to the ER... the dr there wrote a prescription for oral antibiotics. THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION. THEY CONTINUED BILLING MY CARD MONTHLY UNTIL I CANCELLED IT!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 10:05:40__

> Great at first, but ur new policy sucks. At first I was thrilled I wouldn't have to wait for open enrollment and could get treated using this app, by virtual means. After filling out the account info within a matter of seconds I was able to speak to a kindly doc who prescribed me a medication for my severe anxiety and depression due to PMDD. However today, I had dosage questions and hoped my dosage could be altered, but was told no more psychiatric Rx's can be prescribed online. Back to sq 1!🤦<br> :date: __2020-08-28 17:42:33__

> Wait is long for answers. I've waited over two days with no response. You have to pay for faster answers, which is understandable. Just be aware that the free service could have you waiting quite a while for any responses. You might be better off with other services.<br> :date: __2019-10-03 13:28:51__

> stomach pain<br> :date: __2019-01-17 00:45:53__

> Was using the service for over a year and consulting with Dr Leslie Hart. 
They changed the service now I cant find her, get my meds anymore and have 
been going through hell. Thanks HealthTap for changing services on people 
who now can't get their meds.<br> :date: __2018-08-10 19:23:24__

> I'm not going to be paying for this after my trial ends, as it shuts down every time a consult begins. Doesn't let me do a thing. I already paid 19.99 and I'm asking for a refund.<br> :date: __2018-01-06 19:21:22__

> I didn't think that we would have to pay to ask questions! It's kind of unfair! If we had to pay to ask questions you should've just charged to download the app! I had an really important question and I'm sure no one can answer for me !<br> :date: __2016-06-24 17:58:56__

> Wouldn't let me add or update. I kept trying but it would not work.  Plus it kept asking me to upgrade to add money.<br> :date: __2016-03-23 15:29:33__

> I've asked questions twice now without an answer. I guess now you have to pay if you want your question answered. As recent as last fall I had my questions answered within 24 hours. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2016-03-12 21:59:11__

> Stay away! If you're needing a prescription filled and needing it filled correctly do not use this app or company. They will gladly take your money but not make any corrections once they have submitted a prescription. My pill quantity was supposed to be 180 as I take 6 pills a day. They gave me 30, gee thanks guys just enough to last me 5 days. Worthless!<br> :date: __2021-02-14 00:41:39__

Can't be if they dont want to help young kids.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 00:56:57__

> Tricked me out of $50. Don't use this. Thought I could get my standard medications from here. Nope. Was told they can't send anxiety medications. "Dr" instructed me that I had to be seen by my pcp. Kept my composure, thanked the "Dr" and canceled my account. Now I'm out of $50. Dont make the mistake I made. I'm going to go back to trying to get KHealth to work....<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:32:28__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Gundersen Health System |
| **Website**  | [http://www.gundersenhealth.org/](http://www.gundersenhealth.org/) |
| **Email** | gldevelopmentservices@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gundersen+Health+System](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gundersen+Health+System) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When in call the sound plays on earpiece not on speaker. The menu option for speaker have no effect and its very difficult to hear such a low voice while having video conference. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2020-07-03 06:53:34__

> Crappy App<br> :date: __2020-09-28 19:08:53__

> It isn't very consistent. Constantly goes in and out. Very irritating when you are trying to talk and listen to your child's doctor and its all messed up.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 20:18:13__

> Functional but not nearly as good of video image and sound connection as a simple Zoom, Google Plus, or WhatsApp. Better than nothing. We were required to use this by our healthcare provider, and it really compromise the ability to communicate during a very important visit.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 16:24:34__

> They used to be good but now they are absolutely a waste of time, all they do now is tell you to visit their office to have the child seen. Hello!! We don't feel safe taking our kids into an urgent care right now. What's the point of this app if you no longer do anything.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 00:36:36__

> Lagging. Voice going in and out. Not able to hear what the other person saying. Screen freezing.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 20:07:11__

> After waiting almost 45 minutes, the app kicked me out of the waiting, and I had to request a new visit because the Doctor I chose was unavailable. I waited almost two hours, when there were only 2 patients ahead of me. I ended up cancelling the visit because I got tired of waiting online. Not worth it!<br> :date: __2020-07-28 04:13:51__

> Worst Experience Ever! Only once the app has worked for us, rest multiple times it just fails. It says "connecting doctors video" but than fails and says your appointment is canceled. One day we were on hold for 4.5 hours, first it failed call the customer service they reset the appointment, than we waited and the doctor transferred to another doctor and post that failed again. Our friends us CHOP and have never faced such issues.Not sure if its the app or Nemours practices. Will not recommend<br> :date: __2020-07-25 16:52:37__

> Pediatric? Only adult options were listed<br> :date: __2020-07-19 01:15:40__

> Very frusterating. Stayed on the phone for hour just to have the Dr hang up on me due to no connection and i would have full barns on WIFI sitting right next to the box. For days i have been trying to get this to work. And everytime i call the office they just direct me back to this app. On the me help u and it never works. Cant even get my kid seen. Very pissed off mom<br> :date: __2020-07-17 22:37:56__

> The Clermont location is terrible. The staff is incompetent and rude. They do not care about the babies and only want to push products on you without listening to your concerns or needs. Do not go to Nemours in Clermont FL!!! You will be very unhappy!!<br> :date: __2020-07-13 22:39:04__

> My toddler fell outside and cut open his eyebrow. I did not want to go to the urgent care or ER and expose us to c- virus, so I tried the care connect app for urgent care. We were 11th in line waiting. After over an hour and a half of waiting we were still 3rd in line so I left the app running and pulled up my camera to get a new photo of the injury. I switched back over to the app, to see the doctor had declined seeing us. It would've been nice if the app had some type of way to alert you.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 00:06:50__

> Would give zero stars if I could. It says online that they treat ear infections, so I booked an appointment. She has an ear pain and a fever. They said she doesnt have an ear infection and even if she did they wouldn't treat her. That means I just wasted $60. Don't waste your time. Go to a real doctor. I know my doctor would've treated her infection because she's my 4th child and I've been through this many times. I'm so upset! This is what I get for trying to take shortcuts!<br> :date: __2020-03-26 23:36:46__

> Absolutely useless waited 1hr for the doctor to log off and the system to kick me out and make me start all over.........I could wait till morning and see my primary faster<br> :date: __2020-03-25 03:04:17__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HEALTH PLAN OF NEVADA, INC. |
| **Website**  | [http://www.americanwell.com](http://www.americanwell.com) |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HEALTH+PLAN+OF+NEVADA,+INC.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The Now Clinic is supposed to provide services aside from or in place of the urgent care. I've had two different doc's tell me that I need to go into an UC for a simple follow up AFTER I've already been there and the UC instructed me to follow up with the NOW CLINIC provider! PLUS I don't get money back even though the N C Doc's turn me away within 60 sec of logging on. There is no one monitoring this so no way to complain or request a refund.

It can't connect properly to my insurance on every visit and their personnel don't seem to actually know how to fix the situation each time that I have tried to use it.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I had my first visit on May 10 2020. The doctor was fabulous. I just needed an asthma inhaler refill. Walgreens pharmacy said the script didn't list generic as acceptable. Put shortly, it was resolved. However, the inhalers were recalled a few months later. I came back to Express Care to explain I needed a new script. Others need returned. Again, doc was great. What upsets me is getting charged $55. I paid for 2 visits & 4 inhalers unnecessarily. Disappointed<br> :date: __2020-10-05 22:10:48__

> Positive once the bugs were worked out.<br> :date: __2020-07-17 16:22:28__

> The doctor was good. The issue I have is if you take too long inputting information after you choose a provider, it will kick you off and say that the provider is no longer available and you have to start over again.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 21:44:07__

> I kept losing my connection way too early by being timed-out while I was responding to the questions and uploading pics. So, the app needs to be reset for longer response time OR, it NEEDS to be reset to remember the answers before it times-out, so that one doesn't need to start all over again. It was extremely frustrating!<br> :date: __2021-05-09 12:00:11__

> Very poor connection<br> :date: __2021-01-17 16:05:01__

> Connection was weak. Lots of questions to answer.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 02:55:23__

> Very cumbersome. It should connect automatically with my chart so I don't have to answer 1000 questions already on file.<br> :date: __2020-09-13 01:27:51__

> Okay sometimes, but has glitches. Use of third parties in a health care app is not acceptable.<br> :date: __2020-07-25 20:55:49__

> I had connection issues a couple minutes after the appointment started. I disconnected and tried to reconnect, but the app wouldn't let me do that. I ended up just doing the appointment over a phone call, much simpler and more reliable that way.  It's also annoying that it makes you fill out payment info and other forms right when you're supposed to have your appointment, instead of letting you do that in advance.<br> :date: __2017-09-02 05:19:50__

> Can't really rate them high when I get get the ap to work and there is ZERO technical support. I've tried to sign up twice and filled in all my info and it just says "checking insurance info" and spins. Then after several minutes it asks me to log in and when I do it says "my password or username is wrong". Ive done it twice. It didn't work. Too cheap to have a support phone number so screw them.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 22:06:10__

> Slow<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:25:56__

> I tried 3 times to use this, every time when it got to the video it just stopped loading. Total wate of time when I was really sick and needed to see a Dr. That was after it froze numerous times on the beginning screen. I had to reinstall twice and log back in, even call the customer service to reset my password moments after I'd been logged in and it kicked me out.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 07:45:30__

> Tried to connect 4 times. The app told me I was connected but was waiting for the provider. My appt was cancelled 4 times by the provider. Every time I tried remaking the appointment I had to wait in line, so clearly the problem wasn't with the provider's connection. This app was a giant waste of 1.5 hours of my day.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 21:04:51__

> I can't even open the app anymore. It just crashes outright.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 20:57:21__

> It didn't work the first 3 times because of the video connection. Then made connection video started to work and went out, audio only...only choice was to reconnect and lose my place in line again. Poor app wasted a lot of my valuable time.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 23:16:46__

> MY INFORMATION IS CORRECT!! YET I STILL CAN'T LOG IN!!!!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 04:21:33__

> Terrible. Can't even get set up. Have tried numerous times, just keeps looking for my insurance info...<br> :date: __2020-08-29 21:16:01__

> Terrible! Just awful. You have to reenter everything if you go off the app! The number for help doesn't work! The damn thing doesn't lists all insurance! It's just awful! Worst thing to happen to Cleveland Clinic since parking down town!<br> :date: __2020-08-02 18:46:04__

> It's easy and time manageable.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 13:44:37__

> This was a good program. The Doctor I saw was very nice and knowledgeable. The app worked good as well, sound skipped once or twice when a reminder popped up, but didn't cause any major concern. I am happy with this overall so far.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 21:54:40__

> Awesome service. Scheduling is difficult. It is hard to view a providers available slots, you only see availability for the specific date you've chosen. It would be easier to see all available time slot options for the week or month. There's no online waiting room so if your provider is late it feels like you aren't logging in correctly or experiencing technical difficulties.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 01:07:11__

> Some glitches registering until I happened to glance at email. If the app told me to confirm my new account by responding to an email, I missed it.<br> :date: __2021-03-30 22:34:15__

> Very buggy and times out often. When I want to make an appointment, I have to expect to go through the forms at least twice. It will load so long that it tells me to log in again. I just used the urgent care and it glitched where I saw a still image of myself where I should see the doctor, and then my little camera box. It was very awkward, but at least the appointment achieved what I needed.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 18:49:22__

> It's better than most other than apps<br> :date: __2021-03-15 16:21:15__

> Medical phone up to, "... $82, $108," insurance is payment. See app pre explanations. Not a patient.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 22:43:21__

> Hard to navigate.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:33:04__

> My pricing page changes amounts all the time, some days it's $0 then the next it's $82, surge pricing?<br> :date: __2021-02-18 19:36:50__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-09 00:49:39__

> It's my fault for not going to the end of this month for the next few days so I can get the car running a little bit late but I am going to try y<br> :date: __2020-12-25 00:13:06__

> Got a Dr. But what a mess after getting it covered. MDlive messed up taking my insurance (who recommended them). And the medicine they sent was not covered, needed a pre-approval. MDlive says they don't do that.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 16:02:40__

> I actually like my therapist and it's nice being able to sometimes schedule an appointment quickly, but I wouldn't use this app for anything other than mental health. The times I've contacted customer service, they were rude and not helpful at all. They pretty much said, "too bad" to my technical difficulties. The app is very buggy and it can be incredibly stressful to schedule appointments because of this. They're online website isn't any better. They're lucky I like my therapist so much.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 04:38:16__

> Would like to meet and talk to a primary care doctor for my special needs having problem at University Hospital I thought I was getting some problems take care of her surgery<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:49:11__

> It's okay it does the job but with the app I cannot use any type of earphones, whether wired or wireless ones.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 19:03:41__

> Don't waste your time ..only a dozen drs take this with in 50 Mile radius<br> :date: __2021-04-16 14:55:10__

> After reading the horrible ANXIETY PRODUCING reviews, and knowing I experienced similar issues with another Dr appt.. for several DAYS. And now I see many apps tend to not be connecting ..I'm uninstalling this as I DON'T appreciate the treatment by Drs who charge ppl due to the failed technology. Period. Ethically and morally wrong.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 07:44:04__

> I downloaded this app based on my employers advice because it's supposed to be a free service for us. I've had nothing but issues. The registration process was not simple and I was told I had to pay $82 for a consultation. I called and spent 30 mins on the phone with someone who told me that was a glitch and she gave me a credit. Today I'm told via email I'm not covered and I owe $82. This is not convenient and poor customer service.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 16:26:02__

> Bug preventing use<br> :date: __2021-01-13 23:01:26__

> Creating an account is a complete nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:56:54__

> I am very disappointed as I heard this app was one of the best but was a complete let down on my end. I set up a call around 9:30pm and waited an hour and a half for care even though it said that a doctor will be with me as soon as possible. No wait time was ever indicated. A positive note is that it did give me options for them to call back next day. It was very upsetting I had to wait that long but whatever ill delete the app and head over to my PCP.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 08:11:29__

> MD live sets up a contract with providers that if your insurance ever changes to not accept MD live, you can no longer see that provider. This is absolutely disgusting for someone in the middle of a treatment plan who now has to start completely over. Lack of patient care.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 18:40:53__

> I thought it was free<br> :date: __2021-04-28 06:35:02__

> Why are you asking questions about insurance? Other med apps are free!<br> :date: __2021-04-27 03:38:26__

> I tried to see a doctor.... Because I didn't have any insurance and they wanted to diagnose me with covid... They keep kicking me out of the system.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 20:16:06__

> Not used<br> :date: __2021-04-19 05:04:40__

> Just signed up bc having mania for several days. Looking through therapist and they all play classic guitar and enjoying making Italian food with family! Not impressed. This is supposed to help ppl. What a joke!<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:04:20__

> Worst experience with an app. Only downloaded it because their junk website kept crashing and giving errors. The app does the same. Absolutely infuriating when you're sick and just trying to get an appointment going. Garbage.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 02:43:20__

> This is a ripoff. They literally just take money from you without even trying to help. This is a freaking joke. I want my money back<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:46:49__

> A Warning: This app is a scam. The doctor the app paired me with took my $40 co-pay and in the middle of me telling her my symptoms cut me off and told me she wasn't comfortable treating a mild case of nausea. All I wanted was for her to prescribe something to counter the nausea. This "doctor" had already decided before I ever spoke to her that she wasn't going to treat me. She said she absolutely refused to treat me. Just a warning. They will take your money but they may refuse to treat you.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 22:11:00__

> I'm uninstalling this app. The doctors on here treat me suspiciously most of the time and tell me to suck it up and deal. Then I still get charge the same for receiving no help at all. The therapy on here is a joke, too. Horrible app. Find a different one if you can.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 16:43:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Bronson Healthcare Group |
| **Website**  | [http://Bronsonhealth.com](http://Bronsonhealth.com) |
| **Email** | bronsonhealthcaregroup@gmail.com |
| **Physical address**  | [601 John St. Box H Kalamazoo, MI 49007](https://www.google.com/maps/search/601%20John%20St.%20Box%20H%20Kalamazoo,%20MI%2049007) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bronson+Healthcare+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bronson+Healthcare+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bcbsm.com](http://www.bcbsm.com) |
| **Email** | mbryson@bcbsm.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

They overdrew my account once doing this. Not worth the hassle. Can't afford all that every month. I've been having really bad problems with anxiety and this was the best option for me. I was so happy when I found I could go this route rather than the exhaustion of trying to get to the doctor<br> :date: __2019-08-01 01:15:31__

> Pretty cool app where you can see each other and talk live. However, don't try to send a text or do any other operation (web surf or email) or it will kick you off the system and you'll lose your place in line if you are waiting. You'll have to re-log back in again although the info. you previously entered will still be there to copy over.<br> :date: __2019-05-21 15:26:34__

> Terrible and extremely disappointing. I had a skin issue and sent photo ahead of time to clinician I selected.

<br>Patients enjoy the hassle-free experience of online visits, including:
<br>· Affordable, easy, and convenient
<br>· Your choice of U.S. board-certified doctors
<br>· No appointment, no waiting
<br>· 24/7/365 mobile or web access
<br>· Consults and diagnoses, prescriptions as appropriate

<br>· Sore throat
<br>· Fever
<br>· Abdominal pain

<br>· Are U.S. board certified, licensed and credentialed

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | University of Missouri |
| **Website**  | [https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits](https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/video-visits) |
| **Email** | mudoitappsdevsupport@missouri.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Division of IT 615 Locust St, Columbia, MO 65211](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Division%20of%20IT%20615%20Locust%20St,%20Columbia,%20MO%2065211) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=University+of+Missouri](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=University+of+Missouri) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is almost perfect. I would suggest everyone keep in mind the importance of being as thorough as possible with interaction. If you have a temperature and blood pressure gauge use it during visit.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 20:19:38__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-03-30 22:03:02__

> Good service. I would like a better or ore robust user interface.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 21:17:49__

> Sometimes there are glitches like loss of volume ,or one day we couldn't connect at all but over all I like it.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 16:53:31__

> The app is convenient but the doctor I had was rude, didn't really listen to my issues and kept interrupting me.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 02:42:13__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-03-08 20:12:22__

> I set up a doctor appointment for my sleep, waited 16 minutes in the waiting room after the set appointment time, only to be told that he's unavailable. I would rate him but so far I'm unable to find his information or even asked why he's declined to see me as a patient today. So far this app has been the worse to appointments, I'm giving it one more chance with a therapist to see if it's any better this round.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 20:40:24__

> Good doctor, hard to hear at times but overall great experience in short matter of time.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 15:34:50__

> Make sure you enter your health insurance correctly or you'll end up paying full out of pocket<br> :date: __2021-05-07 12:22:02__

> Its a great app and idea 💡 👍 but the video never wants to work and some of the providers will just call 📞 you👍 but some do not Other than the video issues its great would be 5 stars but lame<br> :date: __2021-03-27 00:52:20__

> Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 03:17:22__

> I didn't like it the doctor was kind of rushing through it it was a waste of time & money<br> :date: __2020-10-07 20:32:24__

> Was not able to connect virtually. Also no where to see notes on your visit.<br> :date: __2020-10-01 18:16:06__

> The video call portion does not work. Even the provider told me to use a computer and the website because the Android app never works right. Good provider, terrible app.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 15:42:43__

> I had a good experience with this I was impressed with it, real simple, easy after I stared at for a minute but I'm not good with this internet stuff. I just wish they had a psychiatrist a doctor of psychology. I need a therapist as well as a doctor, I'm in need of medicine & need to vent a well.<br> :date: __2020-07-28 19:00:33__

> I'm pleased with the doctors available but the app has given me an issue with the audio each time I've used it. Is there a patch available?<br> :date: __2020-07-20 00:37:19__

> Not great at all. Took three tries to get through. I can't message the Dr. I talked to and I don't think the prescription was called in. Awful experience! It is fixed now after calling the company. They had to call in the script. Been on the phone most of the day.<br> :date: __2020-05-11 21:53:32__

> Pharmacy search didn't work first time. Time out too short. After logging in again, had to repeat same questions, but pharmacy search worked.<br> :date: __2020-04-11 20:48:29__

> I've tried to use this app twice in the last 3 years. Both times my account was already locked. The phone number they give you for assistance said they didn't know why it was locked but they would create a ticket and somebody would email me. No timeline. Not the level of support you want from an oncall medical service. It's been 1 hour so far and no email.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:52:04__

> App was useful for a couple of months but it hasn't had available providers for months now. I scheduled an appt with a doctor a month in advance and was cancelled with no notice the day of. Useless and demeaning.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 05:16:50__

> In theory it seems good I'm having a difficult time finding any doctors. Very little appointment??<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:10:08__

> Haven't used much yet. Can't see the option for answers down below.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:30:10__

> App is very frustrating. Filled out my information and accidentally put in my credit card instead of my HSA card. I immediately cancelled and later, I received an email from my CC company stating my credit card was charged. I had to start over entering all my my information along with my son's ailments. I selected to see the first Dr. available. The app said someone would be with me soon. No estimate on how much time so I am sitting staring at my phone thinking soon would be 5 minutes.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 04:23:36__

> Audio is not working properly. Every update fixes one thing but creates another. Bad connection abound. I live in Ohio and there are not enough therapist available and no psychiatrist so no one to manage medication. So only half treatment is available.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 22:45:22__

> The visit went well however i need a prior auth for an eye medication for my eyes it has been since September 2nd and it is now sept 5th and i have absolutely nothing for my eye so it went from " allergy pink eye" to full blown pink eye in my right eye i cannot contact the doctor nor can i send her a message i paid 58 dollars to see this doctor and now i have to waste time going to an urgent care just a suggestion check insurance to make sure a prior auth is not needed b 4 prescribing a med.<br> :date: __2020-09-05 22:30:20__

> I really wish it was easier to schedule an appointment with my same therapist. There should be an option to schedule my next appointment when I've finished my session. It's frustrating to have to pick dates and find my therapist's name<br> :date: __2020-08-22 14:46:16__

> Trying to see a doctor all day but the system won't verify my insurance. It wants me to pay full price then wait for reimbursement. Customer service was no help. Just told me there was no ETA to have the system running correctly. Just told me to keep trying back. Poor form LiveHealth.<br> :date: __2020-08-09 23:39:36__

> I have full covrage insurance and they tryed to tell me they cant find my provider... And all information i did twice just to be sure it was not messed up i dont have the money and nore should i pay for it when i have insurance..<br> :date: __2020-06-20 17:20:03__

> 30 minutes and waiting for a doctor .. so no, this app is in no way even a tiny bit of replacement for a good old call to a hospital. If you have a cold, a sneeze or anything insignificant to get checked, something that you didn't get checked wouldn't make a difference.. rely on this app.. anything more than that and you're rolling a dice and taking your chances.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 08:38:40__

> If I could give them -47 stars I would. This is by far the absolute worst company every. They know that I am fully covered to use their services with no co pay. My insurance company cannot stop them from charging me. I have been on 3 way calls with my insurance and them and livehealth online still cannot fix the system issue. I have to paid for services that are supposed to be free and they still have not refunded my money. I think this is the best scam on the planet. Run Fast!!<br> :date: __2021-04-06 04:06:00__

> This app is useless since the doctors can only give you prescriptions for medicafio s and a covid test! Other than that they cannot order any ultrasounds or chest xrays!.....it did not meet my needs at all....will uninstall and just go to my doctors office!!! By the way the doctors can cancel your appointment while you wait on them....causing you to have to find another one!<br> :date: __2021-03-30 22:03:17__

> Why make an appointment weeks in advance for it to just be canceled? Waste of damn time. You suck.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 14:28:16__

### Description
> 98point6 provides on-demand diagnosis, treatment and consultation from board-certified physicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy—all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get the right care at the right time. No appointments, no travel. We’re available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. 
<br>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
<br>There are two ways to get 98point6: via a Personal Plan or a Sponsored Plan.
<br>Personal Plans subscriptions come at an introductory rate of $30 for the first 3 months, with unlimited access to on-demand care for just $1 per visit. When that initial period ends, you have the option to enroll in an annual plan for only $120 per year + $1 per visit. (Please note, only one patient per account. You must be 18+ to create an account and seek care; 19+ in Nebraska.)
<br>Some employers, health plans and retailers provide access to 98point6 at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your plan sponsor.
<br>WHAT DOES MY PERSONAL PLAN SUBSCRIPTION COVER?
<br>Your 98point6 Personal Plan provides you access to our board-certified physicians who offer consultation, diagnosis and treatment. Insurance is not required for your visits. Patients are responsible for any outside-of-app costs, including prescriptions, labs and visits to an in-person physician, if referred. 
<br>WHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS?
<br>Our virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected, board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible and affordable. They are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (98point6 supports photo, video and audio as needed.)
<br>WHAT CAN YOU TREAT? 
<br>Our board-certified physicians are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when it matters, guide you towards the most appropriate next steps. If your issue does require in-person care, you can be sure you’re on the right path to feeling better after consulting with a 98point6 physician. 
<br> 
<br>Common conditions we treat include:
<br>• Cold, cough and flu
<br>• Urinary tract infections (UTI)
<br>• Acid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues
<br>• Yeast infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
<br>• Muscle sprains and strains
<br>• Seasonal allergies, asthma and respiratory issues
<br>• Skin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn
<br>• Women’s health, such as birth control 
<br>• Nausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis 
<br>• General health questions
<br>• ...and more
<br> 
<br>WHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? 
<br>Our doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications. However, we do not prescribe controlled substances (such as Percocet), muscle relaxants (such as Flexeril), lifestyle medications (such as Viagra or Propecia) or medications that require strict monitoring. Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what’s in the best interest of your safety and well-being. 
<br> 
<br>Note: 98point6 is not for medical emergencies.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This was so much easier, and faster, and less expensive than a traditional doctor visit! The process from filling out the information on symptoms to picking up the prescription at the pharmacy took less than one hour!<br> :date: __2021-05-09 00:30:18__

> Wow! This is the way to do simple ailments!! Fast and easy. I needed meds before 9 and couldn't start the process until after 8:30. It was in before 9! Super nice doc!<br> :date: __2021-05-07 02:59:50__

> The doctors are lovely, the app layout is clear and it's affordable. I really do feel cared for and heard in every appointment and I'm able to have quick seamless appointments and easy meditation pick up at my pharmacy. I love this app!<br> :date: __2021-05-05 16:24:59__

> Very helpful great Drs<br> :date: __2021-05-03 18:31:57__

> Every experience I've had using 98point6 has been very quick and helpful, and the physicians have been friendly and personable. I have used the app to get a prescription for nasal spray as well as anxiety medication. Definitely beats going to Urgent Care or a Primary Care doctor. As a Type 1 Diabetic, I already have so many appointments throughout the year. It is a relief to be able to handle some visits over the phone at home through 98point6.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 20:38:18__

> App works really well but is a waste of time. Dr wouldn't answer any of my questions and told me to go see a Dr. I can't really complain though. I guess you get what you pay for.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 06:38:47__

> Takes a while to actually communicate with a real doctor, and then of course its still just texting, no voice, which I don't like. But I appreciated getting a doctor's opinion on a covid matter.<br> :date: __2020-08-23 00:55:56__

> Decided to give app a shot. Got connected to a doctor. She did not listen, listed my symptoms completely wrong, and wrong diagnosis. Since this time, I have spoken with management, not customer service. They listened to the issues and will hopefully correct them. It is a fairly new app, with time there may be improvement.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 23:39:39__

> Very thorough<br> :date: __2020-08-10 14:03:47__

> Useless if you need a dr for children. At this time its only for adults. Which they didnt tell me until AFTER i paid for a subscription and started speaking with a dr<br> :date: __2020-04-19 22:11:02__

> Completely useless. Three attempts, three disconnected sessions, no resolution of any kind, an hour of wasted time. Edit... increasing to three stars due to customer service response phone call. App still needs work.<br> :date: __2020-04-15 18:57:13__

> Chat based telehealth has a lot of potential, and the app worked fine, but the doctor barely said anything. He didn't tell me his diagnosis, just said "I think we can treat this with strong topical antibiotics", and confirmed my pharmacy. I had to ask him what he was prescribing. He responded with 1 word (the medicine name), and them ended the chat - didn't tell me how to use it or how long it would take to heal or ask if I had any other questions, etc. Left me with little confidence.<br> :date: __2020-04-05 20:56:16__

> Interface is not user friendly. But, with persistence you can manage it. I made a mistake filling out the create account form, my birthday was wrong. However, the form pointed me to my name, which it allowed me two tries and then I had to uninstall to get more attempts to get the information correct. I could understand a password. I have yet to use it to see a doctor. I hope that experience is better.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 18:41:33__

> Not helpful and slow<br> :date: __2020-03-26 22:26:44__

> Used this app previously and it worked great now it keeps asking me to set up a profile but not giving me a way to advance. No way to contact tech support anywhere in the app. Great concept now let's get the bugs out.<br> :date: __2020-03-08 07:33:57__

> 27 minute wait and it didn't buzz or anything once they answered so I missed it 😡<br> :date: __2021-04-29 07:29:10__

> Only pertaining to one time, I felt rushed and one question he gave me no options or suggestions<br> :date: __2021-04-22 20:45:46__

> No point in an online Doctor if they are still going to send you to a doctor for a simple urinary tract infection that you and every other woman gets a couple of times a year!<br> :date: __2021-04-06 20:36:14__

> I don't know if this is the way to go<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:40:30__

> I don't think this doctor listened to what I said.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 16:55:58__

> Great concept but a real cra\*\*y app. I have insurance. The only questions asked have nothing to do with anything other than basic personal info. You got next and theb told your not covered. $120? I don't think so. Some of us are on social security<br> :date: __2020-08-14 14:02:12__

> Didn't like it<br> :date: __2020-08-12 20:17:58__

> Some doctors know what they are doing and actually get to the point. Others happen to treat you like a box to be checked off regardless of whether or not you receive correct treatment. But most commonly, doctors treat you like you're faking to be sick just to talk to nab a prescription. In my case, I have 2 ear infections, a sinus infection, and acute tonsilitis. I'm motion sick, nauseous, my head is heavy, I have varying fevers, etc and they won't give me antibiotics. A local clinic covered me.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 03:36:11__

> The app is great concept, meaning you dont have to get up to see a doctor as you can speak to a doctor right on your phone. The reason why I purchase the app was for that reason. My Bartholin Gland was very swollen and I was in severe pain, too painful to get up. I spoke to a doctor who told me to go to the ER. I didn't want to go to the ER considering the circumstance that at this time there is a COVID19 epidemic and I didn't want to be selfish to occupy a room when someone else needs. No meds<br> :date: __2020-07-05 21:15:22__

> Computer questions redundant, did not correctly respond. Example: I said no cough, it kept asking about my cough. Today I attempted follow-up, but did not get notification when Dr. available. Dr. ended chat one minute before I checked again.<br> :date: __2020-06-01 19:22:01__

> Absolutely useless, I've had 2 appointments and both times they told me to go to a doctor for just routine illness. What is the reason to use this app if they just tell you to go in person everytime? The whole point is trying to avoid going in public while ill but apparently they don't understand that.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 16:22:05__

> Doctors won't order regular check up or lab work if you ask for. They will tell you to go for an in person consultation. Also it's only for adults, if you have children, they won't help you.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:00:38__

> Horrific experience. I filled out the application and once I got connected (after almost and hour) the doctor said he couldn't help without a single question asked. We won't use it again.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 03:49:21__

> The doctor just copied and pasted stuff at me and didn't listen.<br> :date: __2021-04-22 18:50:24__

> What's the point of getting charged $40 for a "visit" that's just the doctor telling me I'll need to see a doctor in person? If I could see a doctor in person, I wouldn't be using an app like this in the first place.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 12:44:04__

> Didn't let me get a personal plan app failed from there<br> :date: __2021-03-18 08:33:08__

> This service is a joke. Happy to take your money and direct you to a real doctor for a real assessment. Wish I had thought of this business model.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 16:40:18__

> Useless have earache and congestion told cant help me<br> :date: __2021-03-13 17:49:44__

> Not good<br> :date: __2021-03-01 01:17:03__

> I received terrible customer service from the 98point6 doctors during virtual visits on several occasions. They rushed through the visits, didn't listen to me or give me time to explain my heathcote concerns or needs. Their doctors ended the visits abruptly and signed out of the app before I could even finish asking them questions. Highly DO NOT recommend this app!<br> :date: __2021-02-28 22:13:06__

### Description
> iBlueButton has been designed to specifically serve Medicare beneficiaries, Veterans, Americans covered by HUMANA, the Military and their family covered by TRICARE and those receiving care from the nearly 400 healthcare systems and thousands of physician offices iBlueButton supports. With iBlueButton, you have in your hands at all times your medical information to better manage your healthcare, avoid preventable medical errors, and receive safer and more effective care. 
<br>iBlueButton won the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Industry Innovation competition for its Blue Button® program, to give Americans the ability to access their Blue Button health records. iBlueButton was the first native mobile application approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Americans covered by Medicare to make use their Medicare Blue Button data to receive safer healthcare. iBlueButton is also one of only four applications approved by the VA for Veterans to access their VA health records and has been partner of the VA since 2011, and in 2021 iBlueButton was the first mobile application approved by Humana.
<br>For Medicare and Humana beneficiaries along with their approved caregivers, iBlueButton lets you login into your account at MyMedicare.gov or Humana and retrieve your medical history. Your health information is automatically translated on your phone or tablet from your Medicare or Humana claim  information into an organized medical history in all of its useful details. 
<br>When accessing VA or your other healthcare provider health records, iBlueButton additionally displays your lab results in organized lab panels with indication of normal ranges and graphs so that you can see lab value trends overtime. To get more information for each laboratory test, iBlueButton provides one-tap look ups through Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of Medicine. 
<br>- ALL IN YOUR HANDS
<br>iBlueButton pulls and organizes multiple records into a single Summary Record, with all critical information in easy to view sections (medications, conditions, laboratory test results, etc.) and your detailed medical history (physician visits, hospitalizations, etc.). This Summary Record is available at all times to review, research, share, print and annotate critical health information. iBlueButton’s on device architecture fosters privacy and security and allows for data to be accessible even if you are not connected to the Internet.
<br>- PERSONALIZED SAFETY WARNINGS
<br>Whether it is about the medications you currently take, a new one recently prescribed, an existing condition, or new medical condition iBlueButton automatically generates safety warnings and best care practices based on well-established guidelines. iBlueButton now also offers COVID-19 related alerts, including an alert if you are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, and an alert about eligibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
<br>- LIFE AND COST SAVING
<br>On average every year, a Medicare beneficiary sees seven different physicians and most of the time any one of these physicians will not have a view of the full medical history of their patients, which can be the cause of medical errors, unnecessary tests, and avoidable healthcare expenses. Veterans and military personnel and their families experience these same healthcare issues, as their care takes place not only in VA and military health facilities, but also in the private sector. iBlueButton helps you prevent dangerous medical errors by having with you, anytime and anywhere, your critical medical history.
<br>- SECURE AND PRIVATE
<br>Unlike most personal health applications, iBlueButton stores your information securely encrypted on your own mobile device. Under your sole control, your personal health information is retrieved by your app from the data source and goes directly on your mobile device where it is securely stored. None of your personal data is processed or stored in the cloud or seen by Humetrix.

> Most of my medical records are in one place now---so convenient. The company seems to be adding more providers as they go along. I'm looking forward to seeing a couple more. Developers were very responsive to an issue i encountered and resolved it.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 05:41:34__

> Along with my Medicare records, I'm now also getting records from my physicians. Great to have it all in one place.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 19:24:45__

> Just discovered that I can get my Humana info with this app. Super helpful. Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 01:23:28__

> Great app. All my information from the VA is at my fingertips.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 20:03:58__

> Had initial issues but support worked tirelessly until app was able to work. Allows easy download of va data. Allows to graph out your lab results over time. Easy access to your information sorted by categories. Exactly what I was looking for.<br> :date: __2020-06-26 04:31:01__

> My favorite with this app: seeing an opioid warning for a pain medication I was prescribed for my back and had no clue I could get addicted to that!<br> :date: __2020-05-07 00:29:47__

> Wow, this app just alerted me that one of the medications I take pits me at "higher risk for more severe coronavirus infection.". I thought that might be the case but it's nice to get this confirmation. Got some other drug warnings too that are super helpful. App is well laid out and makes things easy to understand.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:33:49__

> I've been using this app for a few years with MyHealtheVet and with my Medicare records which nicely combines with all my prescriptions organized and listed in one place. I like the MedlinePlus button to research information like medication side effects. I noticed the recent update with the new VA records, with new labs section with the useful plot button to see graph displays and again that MedLinePlus info button which I found helpful to understand what these tests results means.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 19:29:37__

> Really useful to have my VA health record combined with my Medicare Blue Button record. I sometimes see doctors outside the VA and didn't know until this app that I could get my different medical information in one place.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:14:19__

> Works as advertised.<br> :date: __2019-10-15 01:10:34__

> A QUICK and EASY Document review system for multiplatform Care Providers. My only link is : " My Health e Vet " and it allows Documented & Statistical Data Review without need to allow entry to my actual secure site. A very pleasingly designed Medical Portal Software Device.<br> :date: __2015-12-31 06:51:01__

> Concept is awesome. Needs work<br> :date: __2015-02-17 17:13:42__

> Tried it since it was updated just yesterday (wanting to stay away from old junk). It won't retain the portal information, at least for VA.  I'd put it on and save but it would erase it and all again.  I used the same info to log on to actual site with no problems.  Maybe VA has changed their portal access or something.  I am a MHV coordinator so I'd love for this to work.  Update...working perfect now!<br> :date: __2014-07-22 20:47:53__

> Still not sure but the concept is a good idea. I will try it first<br> :date: __2018-07-18 14:23:21__

> Not impressed, and for those of you that think that it's an official VA app...IT'S NOT. For security reasons, they still haven't come out with one. Until they do, this is all we have.<br> :date: __2017-10-25 11:39:17__

> The VA app is still in beta. (I know, because I'm in the beta.) Currently only VA employees can access the beta. All I can say is, it's still clunky, like most other apps I've looked at.<br> :date: __2016-11-21 20:23:02__

> Won't access tricareonline.  Unable to contact support as they filter all of those emails.<br> :date: __2016-05-13 00:32:29__

> Supposed to link to my VA page or from my VA page to the app bit doesn't. Have to manually get files/feeds but deletes previous downloaded items.<br> :date: __2015-06-18 05:46:14__

> When entering the password to protect info in the app it does a force close crash on my samsung galaxy exhibit running android  4.1.  After doing some program diagnostics the crash was the result of a  conflict with my swiping keyboard app called swype keyboard. The keyboard app causes the force close crash.<br> :date: __2015-01-19 06:34:09__

> This app seems to work fine as far as downloading my VA medical records. However, it doesn't save any info; neither reports I've just downloaded nor my personal info I just input. If I try to add my personal info from my card, the app crashes consistently.<br> :date: __2014-11-17 16:53:43__

> I have downloaded and installed this app 5 times and not once have I gotten past the initial password screen. This needs to be diagnosed and  fixed. Other wise it is a pointless time investment. I am a frequent and happy user of the my healthevet application on the web. Having your health records available when you see your doctor (while maybe not essential, it is terribly convenient). we<br> :date: __2017-06-24 18:50:34__

> Great Big Fizzle on VA performance.<br> :date: __2016-04-09 02:02:09__

> Worked fine before now after I paid to get unlimited downloads it just keeps me at the loading screen.<br> :date: __2015-04-12 13:55:58__

> I've uninstall and reinstalled 2x. Unable to email record to anyone. Please fix or tell me how to fix it.<br> :date: __2014-06-29 07:28:24__

> It's a bit of work to set up. If you have an account with the VA or SSA, once you enter & verify who you are, the info should just populate itself; not hand enter everything. There's a memo pad app for that.<br> :date: __2014-03-02 06:34:16__

> I applaud the VA for launching the entire Blue Button Program.   The App is rather inmature and Will take a lot of sweat equity to bring it up to professional standards.   During my first use the App crashed entirely too much.<br> :date: __2013-06-15 05:23:08__

> I would recommend it but it just keeps circling me back to the DS log-on after tapping on VA's button for my records. I was able to access it once after downloading the app. I was checking out my current appointments, meds, vaccinations & diagnoses from provider visits. However, I had to start all over after I tried getting more info for the latest appointment tha I got. Clicked on it & the cycle of the DS log-on started. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 16:10:35__

> Terrible app! The UI is cluttered and isn't intuitive. I was hoping to use iBlueButton to link my VA medical records, but it's not any better than the VA's My HealtheVet website. Don't waste your time with this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 19:28:44__

> App won't even open anymore. Just says some error code and that there is a problem with the server. What is the deal!<br> :date: __2020-01-08 07:37:04__

> This was a total waste of my time. It ask for dates for things in your childhood that no one would ever remember to add it. It also does not have all the medications that I am taking. What is the deal of listing pharmaceutical companies for meds when people go to stores to get meds? Why not just list the med. This is a useless app and a Big waste of time.<br> :date: __2019-09-16 23:45:07__

### Description
> Now, board-certified health care providers can care for you or your child wherever you are, whenever you need them, from the convenience of your own mobile device or computer. From coughs and sore throats, to minor skin irritations and joint pain – we have you covered. An easier way to access both adult and pediatric care teams for urgent clinical care needs and common concerns – on your schedule, and in about 10 minutes!
<br>Your virtual visit may even be less expensive than your other care options, compared to urgent care clinics and emergency rooms.
<br>Simply download the app and register, and then select a provider and ‘click.’
<br>Once you select a provider, the online communication begins shortly thereafter! Telehealth providers accessed via the Penn State Health OnDemand app will diagnose, may suggest follow-up care, and can prescribe medication.
<br>Healthcare that meets you where you are and at your convenience; helping you feel better and return to your life sooner.
<br>Penn State Health OnDemand can be used for various common symptoms and concerns:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cough

<br>• Joint pain or strains
<br>• Lower back pain
<br>• Minor rashes and skin concerns
<br>• Painful urination
<br>• Sore throat
<br>• Stuffy and runny nose
<br> 
<br>The Penn State Health OnDemand telehealth program is not be appropriate for all concerns. The following symptoms should not be treated by a telehealth provider; go to the closest emergency room for in-person care:

<br>• Changes in mental status or confusion
<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Coughing/vomiting blood

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Penn State Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.pennstatehealth.org](http://www.pennstatehealth.org) |
| **Email** | innovate@pennstatehealth.psu.edu |
| **Physical address**  | [Penn State Health 500 University Dr MCH162 Hershey, PA 17033](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Penn%20State%20Health%20500%20University%20Dr%20MCH162%20Hershey,%20PA%2017033) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Penn+State+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Penn+State+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Penn State Health really adapted to COVID and created quite the efficient app. There are a few hiccups but so far every telehealth visit I've had this year has gone smoothly.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 18:11:56__

> The experience was ok. I could hear and see my Dr. clearly. The problem was my Dr. could hear me, but she could not see me. My video was on, I could see my picture in the corner of my screen.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 15:11:25__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 16:48:01__

> The app does have its little bugs, but it's great for keeping track of appointments and the video chat works pretty well.<br> :date: __2020-10-28 14:26:32__

> Works great<br> :date: __2020-09-04 21:04:46__

> Great medical access tool. Its a bit cumbersome to navigate but allows quick convient access to Drs.

> Make sure nothing else is connected to your phone via Bluetooth BEFORE you start the visit or you won't be able to hear the doctor very well! This has happened a few times and once the volume of the other person is low there is nothing more you can do so the doctor gets a lovely view of my ear on the camera because I am trying to hear them! It is really hard for me to remember to shut off my Bluetooth before I go into the app and this has been a big disappointment using the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 20:29:15__

> Okay. It was a dr app.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:45:53__

> Visit summary does not include NPI number or tax ID number, both of which are needed for insurance. Also, they say Corona screening 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., but the day I checked every nurse was offline. This app can be useful for quick first Care service, however.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 18:42:33__

> I had a virtual visit scheduled today for my son. The doctor was unable to see our video feed on either of our phones even though we allowed access to the camera. We had to complete the exam over Zoom after several unsuccessful attempts to get this application to work. Other than this issue, it seems like a nice app with lots of potential. We tried the app on two different Galaxy S20+ phones.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 03:12:03__

> No insurance options except Highmark and doesn't work on Samsung devices apparently.<br> :date: __2019-07-07 18:45:30__

> Keeps crashing. After I enter login and password, app closes. When it does open, unable to book appointment. After I select the available time slot, an error message pops up stating that "time is no longer available".<br> :date: __2021-02-16 01:17:04__

> Very unsatisfied, how can you see a child's throat through a damn phone camera, I'll never even go to that doctor's office again<br> :date: __2020-10-29 11:47:46__

> I logged in for my appointment, 15 minutes early as instructed, and the doctor never connected. I was left in the virtual "waiting room" for over two hours. I had to contact the doctor's office on the phone myself. The app now says that I "missed my appointment." The doctor's staff says I did everything right and they aren't sure what happened.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 19:02:34__

> Worked fine for me, until I added my kids. Now when I log in, it becomes a slow strobe light. Uninstalled and reinstalled, same thing, app chokes and tech support cannot see why.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 15:47:48__

> Crashed my phone, even when not using ....it runs in background.<br> :date: __2020-05-15 13:58:40__

> The app itself is fine but the issue is which insurance companies they accept. They ONLY except High Mark and not Aetna which is the health insurance provided by Penn State University. Bizarre, Penn State Health does not accept PSU health insurance. They don't accept Medicare as well.<br> :date: __2020-04-01 12:38:17__

### Description
> Coalition is a global, privacy by design, contact tracing app to stop the spread of COVID-19.
<br>The Coalition App alerts you if you have crossed paths or spent time with another user showing symptoms, or those who have tested positive for the virus.
<br>Instead of using your location data, Coalition uses secured bluetooth to protect your privacy.  Your information stays anonymous and private, and isn't shared with anyone without your permission.
<br>Only when you confirm that you are sick, does Coalition share an anonymous ID with others who you have come into contact with.
<br>We believe that citizens can help fight pandemics without giving up their privacy, Coalition is the first step to a pandemic free future.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Nodle |
| **Website**  | [https://www.coalitionnetwork.org/](https://www.coalitionnetwork.org/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I like the level of privacy assured and I recommended it on NextDoor. But I have a question. As long as people are sheltered in place it won't be too bad, but even now: say you notify everyone who crosses paths with an infected person. All those people are going to want to be tested, naturally. Are tests available in that amount? And if someone is asymptomatic, how long are they contagious? I'll google it, but I like the idea of app, as a cautious UberEats delivery driver. SF Chron 👍<br> :date: __2020-04-25 02:24:34__

### Description
> The Intermountain Connect Care app allows you or your child to visit with an Intermountain Healthcare clinician for certain urgent care conditions using your phone or tablet.  If you have cold or flu symptoms, sinus pain, sore throat, painful urination, a minor rash or skin issue, upset stomach, or other minor symptoms, use Connect Care 24/7/365 to quickly and conveniently get the care you need from wherever you are – just $59 a visit.  Some insurance plans accepted.
<br>Connect Care is a convenient, affordable way to get care from Intermountain clinicians. Our highly-trained, board certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants have many years of experience in urgent care, clinics, and hospitals, and are specially trained to provide care using telehealth. Your doctor will also be able to see the results of that visit in your medical record, and can incorporate it into your overall care. Depending on the issue at hand, the provider can diagnose, suggest follow up, and prescribe medication, when appropriate.
<br>Connect Care is not appropriate for all conditions. If you are unsure of whether you are having a life-threatening medical emergency, or are experiencing any of the following, please go to your nearest ER:
<br>• Chest pain or pressure
<br>• Uncontrolled bleeding
<br>• Sudden or severe pain
<br>• Coughing / vomiting blood
<br>• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
<br>• Sudden dizziness, weakness, change in vision, slurred speech, numbness, or other neurological changes
<br>• Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea
<br>• Changes in mental status, such as confusion
<br>• Assault, physical or sexual abuse, or child abuse
<br>Additional information about the Connect Care service can be found here: https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/urgent-care/connect-care/

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 19:00:53__

> The PA I saw was great, but the app seemed to have issues working properly. I could see my doctor, and I could see my video was being captured by my device, but he had trouble seeing me multiple times during the visit. I know my wifi signal is strong because I used it to work from home today. Not sure what the problem was. However, I did really, really appreciate not having to wait in a doctor's office during COVID-19. I'll continue to use the service again and see if the app works next time.<br> :date: __2020-04-09 16:39:30__

> It kept telling me that it needed more access to my phone, even when I granted all access.<br> :date: __2020-03-26 21:54:27__

> Kind of confusing how to set up the app<br> :date: __2020-03-26 17:05:42__

> I wasn't too impressed. The wait times were comparable to instacare, but at least I didn't have to sit in a waiting room full of sick people for 3 hours. The lady tried to prescribe me amoxicillin when I had marked that I was allergic to penicillin so I know she didn't even look over my file. Works in a pinch though.<br> :date: __2020-03-18 05:43:31__

My middle and ring finger on my dominant hand will not move independently anymore 24/7/365 is a lie I've been trying to get on for an hour and it just says they're "upgrading my experience".

But what?! No details were given by the Dr about the type of meds and there is no record of it anywhere in the app. So basically the only way yo find out is to have another appointment for another $40....<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:15:45__

<br>A provider portal enables providers to categorize patient cases by severity and mitigate risks of public spread by providing all patients with knowledge and resources to deal with low-risk symptoms at home, while also tracking the development of symptoms in higher-risk patients.
<br>This app allows to help patients to stay home if they are not high risk, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please the CDC website at:

<br>- Tracking the development of symptoms in higher-risk patients via customized surveys.
<br>- Providers can register patients by giving them a facility-specific QR code to scan and download the app.
<br>- Integrated with Fitbit, Withings, HealthKit, CCD, CDA, DICOM, HL7, FHIR and patient portals.
<br>- Mass enrollment module via text messaging for population registration invite.
<br>- Preliminary and followup surveys will be pushed to the patient via the app.
<br>- Patient survey results will appear in the provider portal (Command Center) and will be automatically color-coded by severity of case.
<br>- Surveys can be sent to targeted groups at specific frequencies via push notification, email, or text.

| **Website**  | [http://coronacare.io](http://coronacare.io) |
| **Email** | sales@carepassport.com |
| **Physical address**  | [300 Washington St. Newton, MA 02458](https://www.google.com/maps/search/300%20Washington%20St.%20Newton,%20MA%2002458) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was routed into this after calling a UW primary care. Initial experience was okay. Then tried to reconnect after a couple of weeks. Waited in queue for 3 days only to be dumped out after hours of waiting each day. Do the Drs. know how many patients are in their queue? When they quit, patients just seem to get cut off. On third day app tried to transfer me to a different Dr. but just cycled endlessly. Seems like Drs. can't finish their queues rationally.<br> :date: __2020-03-20 22:59:46__

> The clinic is a rip-off. The Doctors are subcontractors who can't help you with anything UW and just read you Mayo Clinic sparknotes. They couldn't answer anything about Covid-19 testing/screening even though they list th at as a feature in the app. It's a waste of $35 dollars and is practically fraud considering how they rush your meeting while dodging every question as "They Don't Know". Worse yet I called the UW Helpline and they falsely claimed that this was nessasary for appointments now.<br> :date: __2020-06-06 19:15:10__

> One of the worst experiences of my life. Don't be deceived because it says UW Medicine! The UW has partnered with American Well(Amwell) in Boston and they run this clinic. Saw a virtual "DR" who was worthless for 3/4 minutes. He ordered a prescription for me but never transmitted to pharmacy. Amwell even "double dipped" into my bank account also. Beware, beware, beware of this app and don't use. It's not UW Drs that you get to see! Update: UW is cutting ties with Amwell on June 30, 2020. Yay!<br> :date: __2020-05-04 23:08:01__

> I had all the symptoms for covid except feverish temperature. Since it was difficult to get an appt at the dr. I decided to use the app to get checked, i was on the wait line for a good hr till my phone screen turned off. I opened my phone again, the app had refreshed so i had to register my patient info, symptoms,etc again. I was 31st person on the wait list, my screen timed out again and this happened another 2-3 times over 5hrs till i just gave up.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 00:03:39__

> When I was signing up, I didn't know that there is a word limit so I tried to abbreviate and by the time I press continue, it says, my time expired so I started again. Then I started waiting under Dr Rueda at 11:47 am and by 1:23 pm I received a message that the Dr is no longer available. What? Why? Patients are in pain why the added pain.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Baystate Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | bs.appliedtech@gmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It was easy to use. Used coupon code to lower payment of visit and barely even waited 5 mins to be assisted by a doctor via video call. The doctor was pleasant and heard all of my concerns. At the end, the doctor sent my prescriptions to my selected pharmacy. It was an easy and pleasant experience. 10/10 would recommend again.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 16:32:27__

After getting the card approved finally, was able to connect with doctor after two attempts. Dr was bear personable and asked all the right questions. Was a good experience. My theory is that the data connection needs to be at a high connection speed as this app uses a lot of data. On Verizon here so usually isn't an issue.<br> :date: __2019-12-31 18:13:56__

> Terrible!!<br> :date: __2021-04-23 05:23:52__

> Absolutely atrocious. You want to have a system not collect your insurance properly and overbill you? This is the one! Sat on the phone with customer service and was transferred 5 times. Nobody was able to help me get ahold of who I needed in order to get the money I needed back during these times. Instead I was told to try and call back next week because my account may have been created. Even though my appointment was already a week ago.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 20:53:40__

> Very expensive. My copays is usually only $10.00.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:23:36__

> Everyone situation is different. If anything happens outside of the patient or doctors control be aware that you may have to pay for the visit like I did. I reached out to customer service about the situation and after 2 weeks I was told I still had to pay when clear communication with the doctor showed that the app was the fault. So be aware if you have a problem you may be still have to pay which isn't right.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 20:49:42__

> I had Covid19 in july 2020. I was atended 3 times, by 2 doctors. They prescribed antibiotics and fever-pain medicine. My point is, I told both doctors I was 2 weeks with fever, not getting better, but they kept saying I "eventually would be better". After 2 weeks, I started feeling short of breathness, when standing up. I decided go hospital. There, in half hour, they found 2 lungs compromised by pneumonia, and imediatelly started antibiotics. In 4 days I was back home.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:24:41__

> It takes a minute to get the information to the doctor. But then u go into video and see a doctor within 5 minutes. I got my prescription fast. I recommend this instead of going to a walk in doctor or your regular provider. During the coronavirus . I know people are scared to go to the doctor right now. This app allows you to see a doctor and not put yourself or your family in jeopardy. I'd give 10 stars or more if that was possible. Great job to all the doctor's and nurses.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 15:04:58__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City Practice Group of New York, LLC |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | aftercare@citymd.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+Practice+Group+of+New+York,+LLC) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Who the hell do you think you are telling me that I need wifi to use video conferencing? This is pathetic BS. You have no idea how fast my wifi is and how fast my mobile data is. My mobile data is 5G and performs VERY well. I do NOT need wifi to use video. Don't you ever force users to do BS like this. Now I have to walk around and find some inferior wifi spot that will be slower than my 5G, and the main medical issue here is that after COVID, I cannot walk around too much.

Until they get this glitch worked out, I'd stay away from the app. Using the web based versus app based patient portal seems way more functional. If you must use your phone or tablet to access the patient portal via this app, you may currently need to delete the account set up through the web and re-sign-up via the app. I'm no IT guy, but this shouldn't be so hard. :-(<br> :date: __2020-07-02 23:56:39__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | TherapeuticsMD |
| **Website**  | [https://www.therapeuticsmd.com](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com) |
| **Email** | amiller@therapeuticsmd.com |
| **Physical address**  | [951 Yamato Road Suite 220, Boca Raton, FL 33431](https://www.google.com/maps/search/951%20Yamato%20Road%20Suite%20220,%20Boca%20Raton,%20FL%2033431) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Email** | developer@heal.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Despite a billing error, I had a great experience. I cant see going to a doctor's office again. The app itself is broken and the billing is messed up but the concept is fantastic.<br> :date: __2018-10-01 01:48:41__

> Love the service - extremely convenient for families with kids. 4 out 5 because I did have issues with the app timing out, which appears to have resolved by me reinstalling the app - which is a legit way to fix bugs ;) but does not deserve 5/5<br> :date: __2018-09-28 06:26:18__

> The app works great for scheduling and getting regular updates, but I wish 
I could access the care plans from within the app, rather than needing to 
go to the website; it makes me question why I should use the app over the 
website.<br> :date: __2018-05-04 18:36:50__

> Thought I would give it a try and was pleased. Showed up early in their window. Noted they claim they work with Cogna but not sure. For me the convenience was well worth the extra price over sitting in some ready center. Will use this service again.<br> :date: __2018-03-06 22:59:40__

> I enjoy talking with the doctor<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:47:50__

> There's a couple of issues within the teleconference option. One, on my Pixel 4 XL the front facing camera video is on Gray Scale, swapping between front and back cameras doesn't fix it. And two, there's no way to resume the video call intent if you send it to the background, it doesn't show up on the recent apps. I still can talk for a couple of seconds before the conference is killed and the doctor has to call again.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 18:49:22__

> Waiting patiently for HEAL to come to my area in Florida!<br> :date: __2019-10-29 03:29:26__

> My visit with the doctor was OK. He completely overreacted and recommended more testing then was really needed. Long story short, I ended up seeing my regular doctor anyway, which defeated the purpose of this app Plus, they now spam me everydsy with messsges. I might use this in the future in a pinch, but for now I'm uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2018-12-04 20:06:26__

> When entering birthday, a required field, the only method is using the pop up calendar which defaults to today's date and only let's you go back one month at a time, so if you are 30 years old, you need to tap the back arrow at least 360 times to get to your birthday, really? Why not allow someone to just type it in?? No healthy person would want to do this let alone a sick person. Terrible UI design.<br> :date: __2017-11-25 07:58:07__

> There is no services in the Las Vegas,  NV valley @ all.  We need the doctor sevices here.  We have to wait 2 to 3 months to get in for appointments.  It is a shame or waiting in line @ Urgent care for 2 or 3 hours..<br> :date: __2016-11-01 21:15:32__

> There are multiple issues with this app. 1. There needs to be a visual timestamp. Especially in chat. It's obvious as to why it's not there, but it would and should be displayed ethically. 2. There should be a way to set an audible notification, as I have no idea until I look again, whether or not my chat has been answered.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:36:42__

> This app is pretty buggy. I couldn't open or find any of the documents I was sent. I finally went to the website. Also, it keeps asking to verify my email, and then decides that I've already verified. And also, the app icon is the default android icon...<br> :date: __2019-08-20 22:15:47__

> The app has not allowed me to select a date for appointments for two months. It freezes and I have to close the app entirely, then call anyway to make my appointments. The frustration compounds when appointments are cancelled and I have to repeat the process.<br> :date: __2019-07-18 03:08:25__

> Good service, bad app: you will get annoying notifications promoting the app, which interfere with the need to allow useful notifications from the app. When clicking on these notifications, they disappear and cannot be read (you're taken to the "schedule a service" view). Consequently, I just choose to disable all notifications from this app using the Android OS settings. It's a bit ironic that the assault of notification spam is incompatible with mental health, isn't it?<br> :date: __2018-12-05 18:14:31__

> The service is terrific but the app is no longer working well. I have to use the website rather than the app to schedule my appointments.<br> :date: __2018-09-23 18:26:18__

> Live in Walnut Creek. One side of the street has service, other side doesn't. Mind blown!<br> :date: __2018-01-13 20:25:11__

> I'm trying to use it because I am sick but it won't let me save any of my information on it on the profile everytime I hit the save button it just spins a circle like it saving but then if I go back out of it because it does nothing afterwards it just cleared everything out and nothing gets saved so I really never got to use the app at all<br> :date: __2017-09-12 18:56:17__

> App doesn't work.  Actually needed it last week and it failed.  Wound up going to the local urgent care instead.  Waste of time to even use it...<br> :date: __2017-04-27 20:41:02__

> This app goes from creating a new account to immediately wanting to book a doctor appointment and input a credit card#. No mention of copays, insurance, or how/when/if your health records are obtained. Overall, the app feels more like an old-school magazine subscription service with silly clipart, rather than a high-tech health app. During Live Chat, I was told that a house visit costs $189.06 (their website says $159). A phone consult is $189.06 as well, or "only" $79 if you pay cash. That makes this the priciest telemed app on my list of choices, and it is now off my list. I would have saved time and annoyance skipping this app and looking for telehealth services elsewhere.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 18:33:44__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | American Well |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | jon.freshman@americanwell.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=American+Well](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=American+Well) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I have had numerous problems with getting the prescriptions prescribed during my and my husband's visits. I was on hold with the prescription health line for 50 mins, with an expected wait time 55 mins when it changed my wait time 65 additional minutes! I had to check in to the app and see another doctor, paying more money to get my prescription sent to the right pharmacy.

> I will say upfront, this will totally depend on provider, but using this app can be a total waste of your time and $59. You may find a provider who is dismissive and you may end up at an actual doctor's office, as I did. There is no follow-up mechanism, so once you pay for that visit, you are on your own...sick or not.<br> :date: __2018-01-27 16:09:04__

> A three minute conversation for $59.00.<br> :date: __2018-01-25 18:03:46__

### Description
> Welcome to the NALCHBP Telehealth Urgent Care. This app allows you to have a face-to- face visit with a qualified medical professional 24/7 on your mobile device with no appointment or referral needed. All providers are licensed and board-certified doctors, including pediatricians, who can diagnose, recommend treatment, prescribe medically necessary medications and provide a sick slip for school or work. Some of the conditions treated include:
<br>• Allergies
<br>• Cold and flu symptoms
<br>• Sinus congestion
<br>• Fever
<br>• Headaches
<br>• Pinkeye
<br>• Insect Bites
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Cuts and scrapes
<br>• And much more!
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Request a visit - Open the NALCHBP Telehealth app and create an account. Log in and choose an available doctor by reviewing their provider profile. This details their spoken languages, state licensure, board certifications, professional affiliations, clinical interests and education. You will be asked to provide medical history for the patient, indicate what pharmacy you use and pay your $10 copayment for the visit.
<br>Talk to a doctor – Within minutes, the doctor you have chosen reviews your medical history and your virtual visit begins. The doctor will discuss the issue with you, answer your questions and recommend next steps. If a prescription is medically necessary, it will be submitted to a local pharmacy of your choice. The average visit length is 10 minutes.
<br>After the visit – Clinical notes about the visit will be available on your account for sharing with your primary care provider or for your records. Any prescription or sick slip written may also be found there.
<br>Your NALCHBP Telehealth account is also available online at www.nalchbptelehealth.org or by calling 888-541-7706.
<br>Get the urgent care services your family needs, wherever you are, with the NALCHBP Telehealth app.
<br>Your privacy is taken very seriously. An NALCHBP Telehealth visit is secure and HIPAA compliant. This site is intended for NALC Health Benefit Plan High Option members only. Services are separate from your PPO provider network. If you are not an NALCHBP member, you will be responsible for the full cost of any services you receive from our urgent care practice.

For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> COVIDaware MN is the official exposure notification app of the State of Minnesota. With the COVIDaware MN app, your phone gets notified when you may have been exposed to COVID-19. The app is built with privacy-preserving Exposure Notification technology developed by Apple and Google in partnership with the nonprofit PathCheck Foundation. COVIDaware MN exchanges anonymous Bluetooth keys with other app users when you are within 6 feet of each other for more than 15 minutes. If an app user reports they tested positive for COVID-19, the phones they exchanged keys with are anonymously notified. The notifications let Minnesotans know when they should take extra care and get tested. Nobody ever knows your location or identity, and no information on the use of this app can be traced back to you.
<br>COVIDaware MN is made available by the State of Minnesota to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Like wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands, it adds another layer to our defense against the virus. No single layer is completely effective by itself, but when used together, they make us all safer. The app is part of a comprehensive contact tracing initiative managed by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). If you test positive for COVID-19, an MDH contact investigator will provide a test verification code you enter into the COVIDaware MN app. After you enter the verification code, other app users will be anonymously notified that they were near someone who has recently tested positive. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. The app’s source code is available to the public and has been carefully inspected by privacy and security experts. For complete information, visit https://covidawaremn.com.
<br>Help us slow the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota by sharing COVIDaware MN with your friends and family. Let’s be COVID aware, MN!

Also, I'm not sure how useful it was, when it only reports exposures of 15+ minutes, in a world with highly contagious mutations and aerosols lingering after people have moved on.

> I find that my phone does not have enough space to install this app. I have 2 big apps on my phone, and that is all that I can fit. It would be nice if cell phones were less expensive or if my employer issued me a cell phone, but they aren't and they don't, I am not paying $30-$200 per month for a cell phone. $125/year is plenty! So call my land-line or send me an email.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 22:04:43__

> Random notifications with no information in them, no information from MN about how or whether it has been effective... seemed a bit pointless.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 05:25:28__

> I tested this app with someone I know had recently tested positive for Covid-19 2 days after they entered their confirmation code. I never recieved a notice or warning. My phone was next to this person's phone on a table for two hours on three different days? I'm concerned about the purpose for this application and where this information is going and why.. I think logically and am not afflicted with episodes of paranoia. Please explain.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 09:16:08__

> This app gives very vague information about potential exposure. It caused me to be quarantined for exposure to a neighbor whom I rarely ever see. That placed me closer to that neighbor than I normally would be. After testing negative on the 6th day, I decided to remove the app from my phone.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 14:08:36__

> Downloads multiples files every day, there is no settings I have limited data and there is no download with confirmation to see if we want to wait on the updates. It's downloads showing in notifications bar. This behavior is not acceptable to me...as I have Limited data each month. Give us the option to download these files for the app when we are ina Wi-Fi spot..I don't want to use my cellular data all the time, give us the ability to stop auto downloads till we get to wifi spot. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-02-04 04:32:02__

> Buggy and annoying. The "checking exposures" notification will pop up on top of literally everything else even though a background process running is my lowest priority unless I've actually been exposed. And sometimes it gets stuck in a loop causing it to pop up over and over for a period of about 5 minutes. And during that 5 minutes, the app itself won't even open - it gets stuck on the splash screen.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Health Quest |
| **Website**  | [http://www.healthquest.org](http://www.healthquest.org) |
| **Email** | androiddev@health-quest.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The visit was not as good as when i use othet apps. The doctor kept freezing every other second. The visit completely cut off once and the doctor had to reboot. It seemed as though every time she looked at something else on her computer the visit froze. Very annoying. We both kept having to repeat. The visit therefore probably took longer because of this.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Centura Health Colorado |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | scottraymondcentura@gmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It was great! It's very difficult for me to get out, especially in the snow, so this made seeing my healthcare provider much easier. I also live up in the mountains which makes it hard to reach providers in Colorado Springs or Woodland Park. Having this option will make it easier to keep appointments and avoid canceling or rescheduling appointments.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 23:30:48__

> I believe you have a very good interface and navigation. THE MAIN ISSUE: I did not understand that another app needed to be downloaded. My assumption in designing these types of umbrella apps in my career is how to inform the users. From device, operating systems, connections, infor. required, all these moving parts integrated to keep the end user's from feelings of failure, duplication, last min. changes. I did a study the amount of time a consumer will stand in front of an ATM 7.3 sec or leave<br> :date: __2020-11-19 01:09:43__

> Teladoc works as well as any other video chat app. Get in get out get back to bed.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 16:47:20__

> Great Audio, but I could not see my doctor in the video box for my appointment? It would of been nice to have a clear audio and video screen of my doctor for my medical appointments which are very important to my health and well-being. Most importantly, my doctor was able to communicate with me and address everything in regards to my Teleconference appointment this morning. Thank you- TG<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:34:59__

> Great! Easy to use with a little lag time<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:47:51__

> Please add feature so that you can use your phone while on video call other then that the app is simple and easy!<br> :date: __2020-06-30 21:59:14__

> This app is very convenient, and I really enjoy being able to get in contact with my physician without leaving my home. Only downer is that its not compatible with chrome books. I would like to be able to use it on the chrome book, as it's my main 'laptop's. Besides that, I have no complaints.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 22:51:18__

> Very survey heavy. One can't just talk to their Doctor, they have to jump through hoops first.<br> :date: __2020-08-24 23:14:05__

> Disconnected twice while in "Waiting Room." Very frustrating for me to have to go back through the whole process of registering for the visit - does the system save my responses when I registered for this appt the first time? WHY, OH WHY do I have to listen to "Katy" tell me how awesome telehealth is. AGAIN?!? Throws off the doctor's schedule while I am logging back in AGAIN and AGAIN to get to the visit. And the screens I see say the doctor canceled my visit. She didn't. This app did.<br> :date: __2020-08-10 19:32:34__

> Worked fine once I got it working, but the doctor's office had a lot of trouble registering me and getting me the initial email<br> :date: __2020-07-08 00:29:04__

> There was a lot of feedback on the audio.<br> :date: __2020-05-29 19:41:40__

> I've concluded, in an educated way, that 50% of computer programmers are incapable. High paid incompetents at that. Their projects are, essentially, infinite do-loops with no escape. This Virtual Care is a classic example as during a medical PANDEMIC such a medical app should receive the attention of the best of the best, but NO, it is not. Worst of the worst?? What a tragedy. PLEASE find another company to take on completing this app and don't pay for this, heretofore, piece of garbage.<br> :date: __2020-04-28 15:15:39__

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The program freezes up and constantly has to be restarted<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:56:32__

> The concept is awesome, but it would be beneficial to have interaction with the "patient portal" that seton ascension clinics use. Or even to see services and billing history that you can interact with within the app itself.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 20:19:52__

> Like it but it disconnected in mid appointment<br> :date: __2021-01-21 19:47:37__

> Requires wifi which is not always readily available. Does not work well on cellular network<br> :date: __2021-01-19 23:19:24__

> Is app freezes up in the middle of my session I just had a session with my counselor and it froze up so she had to end it<br> :date: __2020-10-27 20:39:40__

> There are usually technical glitches - audio, video, failure to connect.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 16:25:13__

> I live in Evansville, Indiana. Which app and portal do I need to use for St Vincents outpatient login<br> :date: __2020-08-04 20:35:13__

> The app has a tendency to drop the connection and can take a while to reconnect. This dropping and reconnecting takes time away feom the patient and provider and is very inconvenient. It also tends to not reconnect the video or freezes up. I don't know how new the app it but it has some bugs that need to be worked out. I have not had a session yet were the app has not dropped everything.<br> :date: __2020-07-13 18:53:45__

> Update 6/19/20: The developer reached out and we just had an online 1:1 feedback/user experience interview. I am impressed and glad that they are looking for honest feedback on how to make a good online doctor visit for patients. They are making big changes to the app to make the whole experience much better. I might consider trying it again in the future. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 until I use them again. Original review 3/28/20 (one star): This app is the same as the Amwell app, just this one is branded Ascension Online Care. There are probably bad reviews under that app name as well. I have tried two different nights to use this app. On 3/23 I tried for hours but kept losing my place in line (the app closed). Tonight I started with 5 ahead of me, THEN 7?, then by 90 minutes had been down to 1 ahead of me, but within 11 minutes it was back to 5 ahead of me again. At 2 hrs I gave up and cancelled.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:33:43__

> Visit froze 3 times. Kind of irritating.<br> :date: __2020-06-11 16:44:17__

> All I can say right now is.......Why did the Ascension health center close up across the street from me rather quickly......And THEN....begin servicing online. I used to be able to literally WALK to the building. In medical ethics there use to be a regard for rights to peoples' privacy. Does anyone else out there ever think of this?? This, sadly, is the world of tech. They make it seem more convenient.... But do patients forget the personal cost. Coronavirus or not. Is even THAT an excuse ???<br> :date: __2020-12-23 18:37:38__

> App works fine both times I have used it for online dr visits, but when I try to send messages to my doctors through this app they are not being received. They show up in the "sent" file, but verified with drs office that they never got them. This is very inconvenient. Could someone look into this and fix it? Let me know if you need more info. Much appreciated!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 15:34:50__

> Not user friendly for set up I have appt with ARNP but would only recognize MDs so I couldn't register with her.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:42:09__

> App didn't hold recording. Can't email the physician we seen because the app wouldn't let us pick a provider. This has been hell. Needing a foem filled out for work.... nightmare.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 15:27:27__

> Keeps freezing an breaking up.hard to hear...<br> :date: __2020-06-02 19:48:36__

> Video Quality is not good at all. There's a huge lag and pixeling issues.<br> :date: __2020-05-05 18:53:55__

> Poor video quality & sound. Distorted video while in use and sound cutting in and out.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 22:22:25__

> Don't use this app unless your covered by their specific insurance plan. Took 3 days to get the meds they prescribed to my pharmacy. That was with over 48 hours trying to get them to even fix the issue of even knowing I was seen the day before. Also if you are on medicaid, they don't support you so all meds won't be covered at all cause their doctors aren't covered by medicaid. Once all this had gone down, it shows $59 dollars for nothing and was even double charged wrongfully on my credit card.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 21:04:46__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | The Iowa Clinic |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+Iowa+Clinic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=The+Iowa+Clinic) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I appreciate that the app is not difficult to follow and understand if you take your time. I love that it is devoted strictly to e-visits, rather than making them part of the patient portal. When you get logged in, there's no hunting through menus, you are taken immediately to the list of providers and can easily differentiate between those who are available and those who are not.

### Description
> WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.
<br>Your voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>How WA Notify works:
<br>When devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.
<br>Apple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.
<br>How WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>Washington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.
<br>State law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.
<br>If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.
<br>Thank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

This is unnerving seeing that the app settings on my phone show no permissions are in use. I have android 6 but this same concern is being voiced by an android 9 user here in the comments.

> Got notified today of a possible exposure from last week. I could figure out where I was since I had the date, and go get tested immediately. I wish the app said you SHOULD get tested not only if you have symptoms as the testing center wasn't sure if I met testing criteria. But glad I had the app installed if I can prevent further spread.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 19:24:40__

> "When someone in WA state tests positive for COVID-19 and public health reaches out to them, they will be asked if they have WA Notify and given a verification code. With surging cases, this may take several days." => Seriously? It takes you several days to generate a verification code? And I'm paying taxes for this kind of unprofessionalism? Gov.

> I received a notification that I was exposed on a day where I had kept my phone in a space not shared with others (no shared wall, etc), as I do every work day. In other words, no one spent 15 minutes within 6 feet of my phone. It is a healthcare facility, so there is little doubt the "exposure" was generated here, but it seems that either the location sharing probably far exceeds 6 feet, or is far less than 15 minutes in order for me to be alerted to exposure.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:36:29__

> Not sure if it's even working<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:59:09__

> Nobody knows how to get this code. When state officials reached out, they didn't even know what this app is and couldn't give me the code. UPDATE: the process is improving and I ended up getting the code. Changing from 1 to 4 stars. This app can save many lives.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:17:39__

> Just got this so too soon to rate, but I have a question. I am an urgent care provider testing patients for COVID so will definitely be in proximity to positive cases. I wish this app had a setting for when you are at work where exposures are protected and another for when you are away from work where exposures may be unprotected.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 03:18:41__

> The second you turn Bluetooth off it annoys the hell out of you to turn it back on. There needs to be functionality that addresses this gap as people will discontinue use due to the annoyance. Reading the reviews here does not give me confidence that positive cases are being captured properly (even if the person tests positive and gets a verification code by doh) due to the delay from the point they positive test, to them talking to DOH WA to get the code. 2 days to weeks, to possibly never.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 10:30:52__

> The concept is fine but the fact that we are relying on someone who has the virus to input a code that no one seems to know about makes this app pretty useless. The last year has proven to us that we cannot rely on people to do the right thing so that makes this app double useless. This would have been far more useful if it kept the bluetooth device pinging but used every device's phone number and compared it against a database of known infected person's phone numbers.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 15:09:14__

> DISSAPOINTINGLY USELESS. I'm very supportive of this app in theory, but it's basically rendered entirely useless when users cannot self-report, when many positive users can't get a code, and even if they are called by the health dept you have to ask for one, they don't automatically offer a code or recommend this app. To take the cake, many users report multiple state health staff having NO IDEA about such code when asked about it. So sad, this app could have been so useful.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 22:42:26__

> This app was a good idea, but there wasn't much thought put into the development of it. There is no way to enter a positive result or exposure without a verification code. This makes the app entirely pointless since I know of nine positive results with no phone calls being dodged, just no way to get a code. This seems like a pretty big oversight.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 01:50:52__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Children’s Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.childrens.com/](http://www.childrens.com/) |
| **Email** | childrensole@gmail.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Children%E2%80%99s+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Children%E2%80%99s+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> CA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app of California, supported by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, California Department of Technology, CDPH and the University of California.
<br>CA Notify can help slow the spread of COVID-19. It supports both local contact tracing efforts and the State’s COVID-19 prevention program. Using CA Notify is voluntary and free of charge. The more people who install and use it, the more effective it will be.
<br>Once you install and activate CA Notify and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous keys with other devices. (Keys are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information.) Devices with the app installed will record the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will record the signal strength, used to estimate the distance between devices, the duration and date of the exposure. To protect the users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days the keys are deleted.
<br>If a CA Notify user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be able to obtain a verification code that allows them to activate the notification function in the app. Other app users will receive a notification of possible exposure if they were within six feet for a total of 15 minutes or more when the infected person may have been contagious. Anyone who receives a notification can then follow the guidance in the app to find out what to do next.
<br>You must use the verification code to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. CDPH wants all app users to feel confident that when they receive a COVID-19 exposure notification through the app, it is a verified message.
<br>How CA Notify Protects Your Privacy:
<br>CDPH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs in this app. In fact, there is no need for CDPH to know where you are or who you are with for CA Notify to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the Bluetooth technology will share signals with that user. The CA Notify Privacy Policy is available at https://covid19.ca.gov/notify-privacy.
<br>Laboratory results for all persons who test positive (cases) for COVID-19 are routinely sent to public health authorities in California to support disease control activities such as case investigation and contact tracing. This process is independent of the app. Local public health authorities use information from  laboratory reports to follow up with cases to give them guidance and identify those they may have exposed.
<br>Thank you for downloading CA Notify! California can stop the spread.  You have the power to help your family, friends, and community.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

> Simple, easy, negligible effect on battery, and unobtrusive. That's great. The biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't indicate that it's even working in any way. I'd suggest that it at least note the number of other devices that it encountered on a daily basis, so a user would 1. be able to gauge how many actual potential exposures they've had and 2. see that the app is actually doing something. e.g. 'You saw 7 other phones today with the CA Notify app...no exposures reported."<br> :date: __2021-02-09 08:19:14__

Does it take the positive people's identities and connect it with the phone or do people with covid have to manually put in that they tested positive? If they have to manually put it in, it's unlikely that they will.

### Description
> Feeling sick usually happens at the most inconvenient times. However, that doesn’t mean getting the care you need has to be inconvenient too.
<br>You can now have convenient and quality care at your fingertips and even in the comfort of your own bed with the myVirtualHealthVisit app. The myVirtualHealthVisit app provides an easy way to connect with a live provider when it’s convenient for you. You can access a provider in your car, office, or home. A virtual health video visit eliminates time traveling to the urgent care or waiting for an appointment at a doctor’s office.
<br>Receive quality and convenient care on your terms at a time, location, and cost that fits your lifestyle. Urgent care visits on myVirtualHealthVisit cost only $49 or less.
<br>You might be thinking, “When can I use this app—for a sore throat, cough, or headache?” The answer is Yes! Yes! Yes! myVirtualHealthVisit can be used for common conditions such as:
<br>• Upper Respiratory Infections/Flu
<br>• Bronchitis
<br>• Sinus Infection
<br>• Earache
<br>• Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye)
<br>• Urinary Tract Infection
<br>• Skin Disorders
<br>• Back Pain
<br>In addition to on-demand urgent care services, myVirtualHealthVisit now offers scheduled visits across a variety of specialties with many of Suburban Health Organization’s own Hospital Providers. myVirtualHealthVisit is not for emergency or life-threatening conditions, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. If you have a medical emergency, please call 911 immediately.
<br>Now that you have decided to download the app and are waiting for your virtual health visit to begin, you might be wondering what to expect. You can expect to communicate with a provider through a live video and audio chat. The video and audio chat features allow the myVirtualHealthVisit provider to diagnose, prescribe medication, and suggest an in-person follow-up visit, if you need it.  
<br>Your next question might be, “I have a child who is sick. Can I use this app for my child?” The answer is yes! Additionally, as a patient you can invite others to join your video visit (i.e. a spouse, son/daughter of an elderly patient, parent of a college student, etc.)
<br>Along with your care, your privacy is very important to us. Any information that you provide when enrolling, including your personal health and credit card details, is secure.

### Description
> Penn Highlands MyHealthNow offers online, 24/7, care you need now from anywhere.
<br>The MyHealthNow free mobile app makes connecting with a doctor fast, easy and convenient. MyHealthNow currently offers provider consults through QCareNow, an on-demand clinic providing evaluation and treatment for minor illnesses or injuries, with new services coming soon.
<br>No appointment is needed to connect with a provider on QCareNow!
<br>The average wait time is less than 10 minutes to consult with a state-licensed health provider. Visits are just $49 and may be covered by your insurance provider. An easily accessible claims receipt will be available after your visit to simplify the reimbursement claims process.
<br>In most cases, you’ll enjoy the convenience of a virtual provider visit with the added freedom to choose from a list of available experts who will provide you with a consultation, and work to diagnose your medical issue, recommend treatment and, if medically-necessary, forward your prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.
<br>When to use MyHealthNow:
<br>• Instead of visiting one of our QCare Walk-in clinics
<br>• During or after normal business hours, including nights, weekends and holidays
<br>• If your primary care physician is not available
<br>• If you are too ill to drive to a doctor’s office
<br>• If traveling and in need of medical care
<br>If you or your child is experiencing one or more of the conditions below, and you are in need of care right now, QCareNow is for you:
<br>• Flu-like symptoms
<br>• Fever
<br>• Vomiting
<br>• Coughs, colds or sinus problems
<br>• Earaches
<br>• Sprains
<br>• Back pain
<br>• Rashes
<br>• Minor eye problems
<br>• Minor cuts and abrasions
<br>• Minor aches and pains
<br>• Bladder infections

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Only one day<br> :date: __2021-01-26 20:08:39__

> Works pretty darn good to be honest, didn't know for a while but you can video chat with someone on demand, it took me about 10 minutes from tapping the thing to speaking with a clinician, neat! Also crucial was the fact that I told this guy that I had sent a message to the med team, and he was able to pull it up and see it. Well integrated and actually easy to use, which is insane for a medical app<br> :date: __2020-12-16 01:23:25__

> Great medical service, pretty good app I'm a huge fan of one medical service, the app mostly upholds their high standards. At times I get notifications that I can't seem to clear, And it's difficult to manage my child's account, who's also a one medical patient on the same app. All told though, I'm pretty happy with the way the app makes finding remote care easy<br> :date: __2020-07-28 14:58:50__

> How do I create a second account or change my present one such that I can get separate messages for myself and a dependent customer on the app? I am the medical POA for the 2nd customer.<br> :date: __2020-07-15 01:14:24__

> The features all work well but the UX could be improved so that it's easier to figure out "what do I want to do" and then follow a clear path to receiving care from there.<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:46:17__

> Stuck at 66% download. Not sure why. Help!<br> :date: __2020-07-02 04:59:16__

> Would be nice to be able to describe symptoms in my own words, rather than choosing from a list. Other than that, good app. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-02-28 20:49:59__

> Great app, very helpful option for video visits. I was traveling and needed a prescription and they got it to a local pharmacy.<br> :date: __2020-02-04 16:23:53__

> I enjoy the (mostly) user friendly design. Medical team responds quickly to questions and requests. I'm disappointed that the app does not correctly sort medical centers by distance from me. I've enabled location tracking, but it still defaults to downtown San Francisco as my location , so I have to scroll down dozens of entries to find the locations that are actually near me.<br> :date: __2020-01-15 00:16:56__

> *Updating my review. The app team contacted me and after much back and forth got it working. The app now functions as promised.* I can't get the app to login. I can login to the website but I just keep getting a generic "something went wrong" error when trying to use the same credentials. There is no app support to contact to try and resolve this.<br> :date: __2019-11-05 11:59:47__

> Release notes are no place to promote your branding and ask for review. Changed eating for putting marketing ahead of developers app info. Otherwise it's a decent app.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 04:18:36__

> Don't like that you can't pick a time frame for a call or choose your doctor. But the doctor that I got after about 8 min wait time was great.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 01:16:33__

> The doctors are great. The treat me now feature is fantastic. However, customer service 100% unreachable and insurance admin / billing issues take months to resolve.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 01:00:19__

> Doesn't list the provider and clinic I want to go to...pretty frustrating<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:37:08__

> It would be best if the app remembers the last office I went to and keeps that available on My 1med app . Also be on each page maybe. I only use the app on my android. When I see a dot by messages it should dissappear after I have looked at it. Under care plan, there needs to be an option for "other" to leave specific information. I would say....I tried to go to appointment but got lost, or it was too far, or they don't take my insurance. Love the Chat!!!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 23:55:21__

> Please update home screen icon to adaptive icons to fit in with android 11.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 06:40:12__

> Almost perfect. It works very well. The best of my medical apps. But unread and unread messages look almost exactly the same. The title can be bold, not bold, or grey. Hard to differentiate, even with the screen magnified.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:59:36__

> Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:30:43__

> They removed the bluetooth connection and it no longer connects to blood pressure cuffs. They did this during the last software update. This was a good capability as you didn't have to manually input blood pressure readings. One Medical I.T. should consider restoring this capability.<br> :date: __2020-06-21 23:04:12__

> Could be better in navigation and the resources it offers. I would have preferred if it looked like the desktop site<br> :date: __2020-06-07 10:59:54__

> This app is pretty much trash on Android. The ability to take a clear photo of your insurance card is not possible. I have a Samsung S10. Push notifications are inconsistent. Thank goodness I get email reminders. The questionnaire is not adaptive. Respond with "None of the above" and the following prompt asks you for more details 🙄. This app has a ways to go before it's useful for more than simply booking an appointment.<br> :date: __2020-08-17 18:56:35__

> When an app with more than a few reviews rates higher than 4.8, something other than "app nirvana" may explain. With One Medical, it's a culture of zero tolerance for dissent or constructive criticism. Were it not for this Orwellian imposition of conformity (yes they will retaliate), both One Medical and its app might deserve 4 stars. The app (like the entity) occasionally has glitches (like the 3-year time warp). Putting all that and privacy violations aside (should we?), it can be OK.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 00:58:11__

> A terrible experience. Wanted to get the Pfizer vaccine, so I had to install this app and register for this companies account and on and on. Then despite multiple sites LA County Public Health & others directing me to this company it turns out they aren't in fact giving out the vaccine as described. Avoid this one.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 20:14:17__

> Money-grabbing company. They require you to book an appointment for literally everything, so that they can bill your insurance. A few days after an appointment, they told me to schedule another visit just to get a prescription for a medication I've been taking for ~2 years without issues. What's the point of paying for this service when they can't help on demand?<br> :date: __2021-04-17 06:00:47__

> want to call a doctor and set up an appointment? well it's 2021 and you can't do that anymore. one medical extorts $200 out of you so they can play middleman to a phone call.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 00:36:18__

> During a pandemic this company forces you to create an account, sign up for a free trial, and download this app just to try and get a vaccine appointment. Immoral and putting company & profit before what they claim as their mission: providing care to those who need it.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:56:21__

> Really frustrating. Impersonal. Lots of flaws. They cancelled my Covid Vaccination appointment when I went inquire about it. I scheduled my Covid Vaccine over a week ago for an appointment a week later. I tried to call to make sure I had everything I would need to verify my occupation, I waited on hold for almost 20 minutes and finally had to leave a message. They never called me back like they said they would. Then I left another message. No call back. I had to use their chat service. Their representative was impersonal, wasn't aware of Los Angeles guidelines, and was no help. I inquired using their message service and was told that the facility I made the appointment at isn't where they are doing vaccinations (despite the fact that that's what I specifically made the appointment for). Rather than trying to help me, the representative cancelled my appointment and basically said, "good luck." I can't believe they are charging $200 a year for this.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 22:30:10__

> The app does not even open and immediately crashes<br> :date: __2021-02-01 15:50:40__

> Horrible, steer away at all costs<br> :date: __2021-01-30 21:06:27__

> Unable to make a Covid-19 vaccination appointment.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 00:58:43__

> Great unless you move outside an office area. Then extremely unhelpful. Their customer service staff also play games on phone calls. Will not sign up again for the same service I can get elsewhere without paying $200 extra.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 20:51:23__

> Trash bag of an app that gets stuck on a perpetual reload screen when you sign in. Oh and it signs you out by itself. Pretty sure this app gave my phone the electronic version of covid.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 20:44:22__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | UnityPoint Health |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | unitypointhealth.developers2@gmail.com |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UnityPoint+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=UnityPoint+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is fine but I was out of town and needed to input a Pharmacy in the town I am visiting. The App did not give me an opportunity to do that. Thankfully I remembered this and told the doctor. i would have been very frustrated if the prescription was sent back to my hometown.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 22:49:27__

> They double charged my card for one visit. Was on hold for 30+ minutes with customer support and still wasn't able to get ahold of anyone. Extremely frustrated. The app itself is a good idea and talking to a doctor was convenient from home. Just dont like being charged twice.<br> :date: __2020-03-19 13:50:21__

> the doctors are knowledgeable and it's wonderful to have an option to see a care provider virtually. my major issue is connectivity. i waited in queue for 30 minutes to see a provider and was kicked out, having to start all over again and wait for even longer to get assistance.<br> :date: __2019-01-10 16:27:45__

> It's a good start.  When signing up I had to enter my DOB which was difficult.  The calender defaulted to 2016 and no way to easily change it.  I had to tap 60 times to get to my DOB.<br> :date: __2017-06-20 01:16:28__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Avera Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.avera.org](http://www.avera.org) |
| **Email** | averanow@avera.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> WI Exposure Notification is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app in the State of Wisconsin supported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WI DHS). WI Exposure Notification helps to contain the spread of COVID-19 by complementing the ongoing contact tracing programs carried out by the local and tribal public health agencies and DHS. 
<br>Using WI Exposure Notification is voluntary and free of charge. It was built with your privacy and security in mind. The more people who install and use the app, the more effectively it can be in helping us contain the virus. 
<br>Once you install and activate WI Exposure Notification and turn on Bluetooth, the app works in the background and exchanges anonymous signals with other devices. These signals, or keys, are long random strings of characters that are not tied to any personal information. Devices with the app installed will remember the keys generated by other devices nearby. The app will also record the signal strength, which is used to estimate the distance between two devices, as well as the duration and date of the exposure. 
<br>To protect users’ privacy, these keys are only kept on the user’s own device. After 14 days, the keys are deleted. If a WI Exposure Notification user tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive a verification code from the State of Wisconsin.  Users must activate the verification code that is only available from the State of Wisconsin in order to report a positive result via the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. 
<br>WI DHS wants all app users to feel confident that, when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event to be trusted. When users choose to share a positive test result, this notifies other app users that were close enough to the infected person for a long enough period of time (approximately within 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes in a single day) that they are considered a close contact and at risk of infection. 
<br>Anyone who receives a notification should follow the guidance in the app for next steps. WI DHS takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. WI DHS does not need to know where or who you are for WI Exposure Notification to work. The Wisconsin COVID Notice Privacy Policy is available at https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/app-privacy.htm. 
<br>Please note that WI Exposure Notification is intended for users ages 18 and up. The app was developed using the Google Apple Exposure Notification API through a collaboration between Google, Apple, and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So simple, doesn't drain your battery like some say. The more people who get this the more chances it has of doing what it's supposed to... Not getting a notification is the goal and a good thing. Zero exposures so far and I hope it stays that way.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 21:03:23__

> The app reminds me when I have Bluetooth turned off and otherwise operates entirely in the background. There doesn't appear to be any impact on battery life. The more people who download it, the more useful it becomes. I've done my part.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 23:58:29__

> The app sits there and doesn't do much. I haven't received any notifications and I haven't sent any; hope that doesn't change. Does this work with other states or only other people who have this app installed? What do people in Illinois use?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 01:47:32__

> Wonderful app. Since installing the app I have not had the covid. I had concerns about my privacy but since I always wear my medically approved covid mask those concerns vanished since they can't see my whole face. I am also constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands so they can't track my DNA. Wonderful app, everyone should install and take the privacy precautions I do 😷 🧴🧼<br> :date: __2021-01-10 07:01:51__

> This is the officially released app you the state of Wisconsin. I was initially uncomfortable with the idea of using this app due to privacy and data collection concerns, but after thoroughly reading the short and straightforward privacy policy I was put at ease of these risks.

> Sounds like a great Idea and im going to try it out for a while but ppl arent going to like the fact that Bluetooth and location hafta be on all the time so not only will it kill everyones batteries but ur going to be followed everywhere you go and to alot of ppl its going to sound like a gov plot to control ppl thru this "backdoor" method!<br> :date: __2020-12-24 12:49:04__

> Seems good so far. I wish it would encourage people to stay home if they are infected. The University app is supposed to be used as a building access pass. If you are positive or have not been tested recently then entry is denied. Seems like a good thing.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 23:05:01__

I've had this app since the first day it became available in Wisconsin, traveled throughout the state several times and not once have I received a notification? With the high case numbers in WI, I find this very hard to believe. Better to wear your mask, stay safe and don't waste your time with this spyware.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 23:05:19__

### Description
> AlohaSafe Alert is a voluntary new service that helps slow the spread of COVID-19. AlohaSafe Alert is the official exposure notification app of Hawaii and has been designed for use in Hawaii in coordination with the Hawaii State Department of Health.
<br>The goal of AlohaSafe Alert is to support the re-opening of Hawaii communities and economies.
<br>If you have enabled Exposure Notifications on your phone, whenever you are within close proximity (approximately 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes), your phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens. If that person later tests positive for COVID-19, you will receive a notification about a possible exposure. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can share these anonymous tokens, which will send a notification to anyone with whom you have exchanged tokens recently, notifying them of possible exposure.
<br>This service has been designed for use in Hawaii. This service does not collect any personally identifying information or share it with the State of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health, Apple, or Google. AlohaSafe Alert is a source of up to date COVID-19 information & guidance. The AlohaSafe Alert app was built using the open source project developed by PathCheck Foundation.

| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works ok, still not sure what it's use for.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 03:32:43__

> Very easy to use, doesn't require any personal info. It does require bluetooth but it's anonymous and you can keep it off at home and just use it when connecting to wireless headphones/remember to turn it back on when you go out. Only criticism is it's only in english and spanish, needs more languages. You shouldn't have to know english to be safe and keep others safe. It's just accessibility.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 05:04:18__

> Easy, easy, easy. The app installed in seconds. There is NO setup. It doesn't ask for any input at all. You don't need a username, password, or email address. Just open the app, read the screens, and press the button to enable notifications. The whole process takes about 15 seconds, and then you never have to open the app again unless you receive notification that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 21:22:54__

> This app has a bug in it. On a moto 6 it grabs the Bluetooth and won't release it. So you have to reboot your phone to connect to your car's hands free system. It should also allow you to adjust exposure time. 15 mins is way too long given the higher contagion strain.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 22:11:42__

> This app shares the weakness of all of these apps in that it doesn't warn me of shorter exposures rather only if I've been exposed for 15 minutes. Plus it doesn't tell me where the hotspot areas are so I have no way of knowing where or when I should avoid certain places. A minor but annoying point was that this app interfered with the playing of Bluetooth in my car.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:32:00__

### Description
> CURE ID is a reporting site that gathers information on how clinicians around the world are caring for patients with infectious diseases which lack adequate treatments. 
<br>With the CURE Mobile App and Website, you can submit your experience treating an interesting patient and review the experiences of other clinicians with “drug repurposing” – i.e. using existing drugs in new ways (for new diseases, in new combinations, or new doses/durations). You can also participate in discussions with a global clinical community.
<br>We are interested in all cases, including those where the patient improved, deteriorated, or even had an indeterminate outcome. 
<br>Join the global community of clinicians sharing their real-world experiences using repurposed drugs for infectious diseases that lack adequate treatment!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> HEALTHCARE, RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
<br>The Virtual Care Anywhere app brings the doctor visit to you – when and where you need it. Within 30 minutes of requesting care, you’ll be speaking with a board-certified doctor or registered nurse practitioner.
<br>Our team of board-certified doctors and nurse practitioners are available 24/7 to provide consultations, diagnoses, and treatment via video chat or phone. No appointment is needed. Our team can also call prescriptions (those that are deemed clinically appropriate) into your local pharmacy. 
<br>Use Virtual Care Anywhere for common conditions, such as:
<br>•	Cold and flu
<br>•	Pink eye
<br>•	Rash
<br>•	Stomach flu
<br>•	Allergies
<br>•	Back pain
<br>•	Urinary tract infections in adult women
<br>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
<br>1. What does it cost?
<br>Each Virtual Care Anywhere visit costs a flat fee of $35, always. There are no hidden or added charges. At the beginning of your visit, the provider will determine whether your health concern is appropriate for virtual urgent care. If it’s not, you will not be charged for the visit.
<br>2. Will insurance cover my visit?
<br>Most insurance plans do not cover virtual health services at this time, and we cannot guarantee reimbursement. However, a Virtual Care Anywhere visit is a qualified medical expense and you can typically use your HSA or FSA account to pay for it. An invoice that you can submit to your insurance plan for reimbursement will be available through the web portal for your Virtual Care Anywhere account after each visit. 
<br>3. How does a virtual visit with Virtual Care Anywhere work?
<br>You will meet with one of our medical providers via phone or video chat. You can request a video chat through the mobile app, via our website, or by calling our toll-free number.
<br>Our website requires that JavaScript and cookies be enabled. If you are unable to access the website or experience technical difficulties, please call our patient concierge team at (855) 356-8053.
<br>4. Who is eligible?
<br>Virtual Care Anywhere is available to people of all ages, across the United States. Virtual visits are not available to those covered under a federal insurance program such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, or Tricare, unless you are specifically set up by your insurance plan administrator.
<br>5. Will my primary care provider receive my visit summary?
<br>After every virtual visit, the Virtual Care Anywhere provider will write a personalized visit summary that outlines the visit, treatment recommendations and outcomes. You can choose whether to share it (or not) with your primary care provider at the close of the visit. This visit summary is accessible at any time from your Virtual Care Anywhere account page.

> I won't go back to the urgent care I will use this app virtual care everytime and I would recommend this to everyone.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 03:45:05__

> Great doctor and fairly quick response. I felt comfortable with the quality and care.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 17:03:14__

> Took a little while to see someone even though it said I was next in line. It threw me into another doctors que after I'd been waiting in another room for 10 min.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 15:50:19__

> Cool efficient experience.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 11:35:23__

> Took about 2 hrs to see a dr. But was very pleased when I finaly got thru. Stood in line 3 times and was transferred to a different on each time. Any way my daughters getting the treatment she needs with out getting exposed to anyone else's germs I'm pleased.<br> :date: __2020-03-28 20:21:32__

> It took me a LONG time to FINALLY get thru plus i kept getting switched back and forth from doctor to doctor but then I called customer support and was told to "choose a specific provider" instead of "first available provider." When I finally got connected to a doctor, he was a very nice, patient, and helpful doctor. Thank you 😊<br> :date: __2020-03-23 02:47:06__

> The Dr's on here are pretty nice and the fee is reasonable at only $30. I used this when I didn't have health insurance and needed Dr's notes for my work. However, this app has no support email or phone number. They have a "number" but when you call its just static. I emailed the developer email when I had an inquiry, and there was no response. On top of that, there's no option to delete your account or your payment info, if you want to stop using the app.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 18:40:42__

> The app clearly says you can use it to diagnose rashes but of course the doctor then says it's hard to diagnose rashes through the app and then guesses what it might be. I'll have to go in to a clinic which I was trying to avoid in the first place. The app is fine and easy to use. It would be nice if you could choose the gender of the doctor. I like the follow up message for my records. I liked that I could upload photos of my symptoms but the doctor I got didn't seem to have looked at them.<br> :date: __2019-10-30 15:06:21__

> Mediocre. Couldn't connect video, though every other video call app works for me. Call quality was iffy. There's no written summary of my visit?! No email. No receipt for my payment. No way to send a message within the app with questions. My local hospital system is linked to this and my virtual chart there has no record of my "visit".<br> :date: __2020-07-17 18:27:19__

> I was skipped over multiple times and put behind other patients after I had been notified the Dr was about to see me. This is pretty unacceptable. I'm guessing they felt other cases were more urgent than mine, when in actuality I needed to be headed for the emergency room. Very upsetting.<br> :date: __2020-06-25 06:42:22__

> Due to being late at night and unsure of current urgent care procedures for COVID opted to try Virtual Care. Talked on the phone to nice professional, who agreed with me on symptoms, will write a prescription for antibiotic and i can pick up tomorrow. Next morning i go to my pharmacy ( double checked to make sure it was the right one) they said no prescription was written. Tried calling on call nurse who said call virtual care and get charged again. Now sitting in urgent care anyway.<br> :date: __2020-05-23 22:48:25__

> App is garbage. Has NO customer service support, a pathetic description of services and no where to input insurance information<br> :date: __2020-08-24 13:53:43__

> I wouldn't get connected for 2 full calls. Waited for 40 minutes for both calls. They said that they couldn't even diagnose me and that I still had to physically go to a provider. I wasted 35 dollars and now I have to go in and pay another 60 dollars. Save your money they like to say everything is associated to Covid. A simple stomach ache.<br> :date: __2020-07-04 05:42:02__

> This smells scam. Doesn't seem to belong to any network. Not even sure it was a real doctor who called me. Misspelled both my last and the first name on the referral to practically nowhere. Left me guessing "What was it?" I used the government sponsored code, definetely wouldn't give them my credit card. Some shady money making app.<br> :date: __2020-06-23 21:19:00__

> I just waited, not even exaggerating, FOUR HOURS!! Because I neeeed to see a doctor and get into one in person. After 4 hours and wasting most of my day I excited out just for me to see the doctor I was waiting on was still available. Very unhappy!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-04-28 00:56:15__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | MetroPlus Health Plan |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | Customer.Support@AmericanWell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MetroPlus+Health+Plan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MetroPlus+Health+Plan) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A very nice doctor I just saw there love the way she help me.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 01:27:53__

> What a great first virtual experience with a REAL doctor. I only had to answer a few questions, pick a provider (they even show you how many patients are waiting for the doctors on the list!)and wait until the doctor shows up on your screen. I waited about 15 minutes top and she had a patient before me. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who needs URGENT CARE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. That's what this app does! It's awesome.

### Description
> This app was developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) as a component of their COVID-19 homeless response strategy. The app is designed to equip homeless outreach workers across LA County to triage the sick and most vulnerable and monitor spread among the 50,000+ people experiencing homelessness in LA County. 
<br>This app enables outreach teams and coordinators to…
<br>- Conduct surveys with individuals experiencing homelessness to determine best safety advice or course of action for those who are symptomatic (survey developed by doctors at Housing for Health, Division at the Department of Health Services based on FEMA and CDC guidance). 
<br>- See locations of individuals in need of outreach follow up.
<br>- View hotspots of individuals and homeless encampments to track resource and response needs countywide.
<br>Use of this application is available to any current or new homeless outreach worker tasked with triaging the sick and most vulnerable and monitoring spread of COVID-19 (authorized by homeless service providers and governing bodies like the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority).


### User interface

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app works great but I happened to be out of state during my video visit so the doctor refused to see me. She said it was considered practicing medicine across state lines which violates her license and that UW was very strict about that. I totally understood and told the doctor to disconnect our call. But that requirement should be made clear in all communications made with patients. Many of us travel extensively for work. Make sure you are in the state when you have an appointment.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 21:19:35__

> Got transferred twice, waited a half hour, and spoke with the rudest doctor. They can't handle common things like ear infections so it's pretty worthless app and process. Coupled with the charge (should be fully covered by insurance) this app and essentially the entire process is useless. If you have a runny nose I guess this might be up your alley, but otherwise it's a complete waste of time and technology for them to offer this service and then not offer care.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 03:10:22__

> Covid19 hotline told me to talk to a doctor immediatly, and i put in my insurance and it still wants me to pay exactly 50 bucks to video chat. America is better than this.<br> :date: __2020-03-30 05:29:22__

> Won't connect me to video chat despite having permissions to do so. Tried twice which took two hours cuz each time I had to wait for a doctor to try to connect which then ended up not connecting and the doctor disconnected. Not what we need in this health crisis!

> Easy interface, worked well<br> :date: __2020-08-19 22:06:36__

It has a mayor issue with the login screen where the mask it use to hide the remembered email results in a wrong email or password message if you don't delete and write everything. It becomes a hassle specially when you're in a hurry because the appointment is about to begin and you have to upload pictures and everything.

> Clinicians need to wear headsets to avoid feedback during calls. Took two hours to troubleshoot issues and I'm a Healthcare IT security analyst. App does not sync with patient portal / EMR natively which caused part of problem. Other problem is that for most Google users, the email coming from domain will go into spam.

> Overpriced. Classist. Our doctor's office plugs them. I downloaded the app and immediately deleted it when I saw there's a $59 copay even with insurance! Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2019-11-09 00:23:06__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Augusta University |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | itc@americanwell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Augusta+University](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Augusta+University) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> UT Exposure Notifications is the official Exposure Notifications app of Utah and the Utah Department of Health. Exposure Notifications is a voluntary new service developed in partnership with Google and Apple to help slow the spread of COVID-19. No GPS, location information or personal identifiers will ever be collected, stored or shared by this service.
<br>UT Exposure Notifications can quickly notify you if you've likely been exposed to COVID-19. Knowing about a potential exposure allows you to reduce the risk to your family, friends, neighbors and community.
<br>By enabling Exposure Notifications, whenever you were closer than 6 feet from someone who has the virus for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or longer in a 24 hour period, both phones will exchange secure, anonymous tokens using Bluetooth. If another user you’ve been near tests positive for COVID-19, they can upload their result to the app which will send a push notification to you and anyone else their phone has exchanged tokens with recently, notifying you of a possible exposure.
<br>If you test positive, you can easily and anonymously notify others to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm excited for an app to notify about exposure, if we had this 6-9 months ago we could have seriously flattened the curve and saved lots of lives. This app will need pretty good installation rate to be effective. It looks like 5k installations today so far.(I think this is the first day), hopefully the adoption continues. We needed this 6-9 months ago, before the vaccine was available to slow the spread. Well here's hoping lots of people install it!<br> :date: __2021-02-17 23:44:40__

> I appreciate that this app allows people to be notified anonymously that they've been exposed so maybe people will feel more comfortable communicating testing status vs trying to reach out to everyone they may have been in contact with.

### Description
> NM Notify is the official Notification App of New Mexico and the New Mexico Department of Health. It uses Bluetooth technology to alert you when you have been in contact or close proximity to someone that has tested positive for COVID-19. The app uses the Bluetooth technology on your phone to exchange anonymous codes with anyone in your proximity with the same app. If one of those people should become infected within 14 days of your contact, you will be alerted. You'll be told that you have been in contact with someone that has tested positive for COVID-19. Then it will advise you on what steps to take to keep you and others around you safe. Likewise, if you test positive for COVID-19 you can upload your "positive" code and anyone that you have been in contact with will receive an alert. It's completely anonymous, you won't know and others won't know who exposed who.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NM DOH |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | nmnotify@nm.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NM+DOH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NM+DOH) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Good<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:38:06__

> This app has saved me hours of drive time to and from specialists for me and my daughter. The providers have always been knowledgeable, helpful, and take time to listen to my concerns. I had an issue with my daughter's visit. While we both have UPMC, we each have different plans. I was unable to add her insurance and had to pay $59 for her visit, but later had it refunded. If that glitch is fixed I'll change my review to 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-07-07 04:14:08__

> Good except the wait was long.<br> :date: __2020-02-24 14:00:05__

> Not bad...just strange to talk to some on the phone and they give u medical advice. But so much better than guessing what you may have by searching online. That aspect it's really nice. So just keep taking over the counter meds.<br> :date: __2019-12-30 18:47:04__

> Other than my phone didnt show video it seemed well for a first time experience.<br> :date: __2019-11-10 11:45:07__

> very good<br> :date: __2019-06-29 21:21:56__

> My first time using this was much more favorable in comparison to leaving my house, waiting for hours, paying a high co-pay at an urgent care, or not getting an appointment at my Drs office for days. My only complaint would be having more than one provider available before work/school in my area.<br> :date: __2019-01-16 13:56:18__

> The nurse was very efficient. However, we had a hard time getting the call through properly. She could hardly hear me on her end. I had to wait for over 2 hours to be seen. Then she seemed to rush me through. I spent about 3 minutes total in my call. In the end though she gave me a prescription. I don't know if I would use this again.<br> :date: __2020-03-17 20:08:08__

> I keep getting booted from virtual visit<br> :date: __2020-11-03 05:14:21__

> Used the app as told to do by my PCP doctor and insurance company(UPMC). Got charged $60 (when told fees are waived by insurance company) just to see a doctor after a 2 hour wait and be refered for COVID testing. Called UPMC was told they where refunding my $60 and would take 7-10 business days to reflect on my credit card, yet never got a refund and now it is "to late" to process a refund. Save your time and money, go to the ER or walk-in clinic.<br> :date: __2020-09-02 05:18:39__

> Out of nowhere for no reason it's suddenly kicked me on would not let me back in. No matter how hard I tried, it locked me out.<br> :date: __2020-06-02 06:47:25__

> concept is nice but I just wasted 15 dollars. all they told me was go in to the doctors. going in would be nice if I could take time off to do it. which is why I did this in the first place. frustrating......<br> :date: __2019-04-11 05:51:33__

> UPMC rocks in real life, their IT is not so much fun. The number of times I got an error message; if they were dollar bills I'd own a good chunk of the profits. Error message after error message no matter how carefully I entered sensitive information. I gave up trying to get a Virtual Appointment. Found out they had my information entered incorrectly and guess what, I had to engage a person to fix it. Including an email and a phone call and a lot of headaches.<br> :date: __2019-04-10 02:34:09__

> Do you really have to have UPMC insurance....if so that should be made clear... so I have to delete the app disappointing<br> :date: __2018-10-18 16:57:57__

> I tried it out late tonight due to experiencing UTI symptoms that I'm too 
uncomfortable with to wait til morning to go to an urgent care for. The 
site closed a few times while I was filling out my info, and the nurse 
practitioner I was connected with was not at all friendly, very curt and 
abrupt like I was bothering her or something. She listened to my symptoms 
and said she would have a prescription sent in to my chosen 
pharmacy...which I'm still waiting to hear from saying the prescription had 
even been called in. Maybe its just because its the middle of the night and 
things are slowed down, but I'm in pain here! I hope it goes through soon 
or else they charged me $50 for nothing<br> :date: __2018-08-07 06:45:42__

> Needs to be de-bugged. Repeatedly tried to get past naming my Pharmacy and the process would crash and then I had to re-enter all of my data. Finally resorted to the PC version and everything worked out great.<br> :date: __2017-09-11 00:14:39__

> I can never get the video connection to work on this app, yet have no problems at all connecting to virtual visits on the MyUPMC app. I have no idea why this app never works. Providers never called me back after they cancel the call, so a waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 10:45:51__

> I tried the video appt. I dont mind waiting. Honestly an hour & 1/2 isn't bad when youre home & not doc office. So the convenience of it (in theory) is a wonderful idea. The 2 attempts for an appt were more headache than necessary. 1st attempt I was kept waiting with 1 person in front of me for nearly 2 hours. 2nd try the 6 patients before me went fast. My turn and the doc cant get video working and cancels on me - no phone call. This isn't a good tool if the med staff cant operate the tech.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 01:56:58__

> I honestly feel very leery about all this and also i dont think it is being very honest as a chronic care patient of my personal MD. Dr. David Tucker... I have very much high respect for him because he is a very caring, and a complete genious!! I have been with my Dr. for over 10 year's now!!..

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | ProMedica Health System, Inc. |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | digital.communications@promedica.org |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProMedica+Health+System,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ProMedica+Health+System,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Bozeman Health |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bozemanhealth.org](http://www.bozemanhealth.org) |
| **Email** | mobileapps@bozemanhealth.org |
| **Physical address**  | [915 Highland Blvd Bozeman, MT 59715](https://www.google.com/maps/search/915%20Highland%20Blvd%20Bozeman,%20MT%2059715) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bozeman+Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bozeman+Health) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Mercyhealth |
| **Website**  | [http://www.mercyhealthsystem.org](http://www.mercyhealthsystem.org) |
| **Email** | tom@tomjensen.net |
| **Physical address**  | [1000 Mineral Point Ave Janesville, WI 53547](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1000%20Mineral%20Point%20Ave%20Janesville,%20WI%2053547) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mercyhealth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mercyhealth) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I love this service! In this day and age, with Covid protocols and the stigma following even the common cold - it was a relief to be seen in less than five minutes and have a prescription ready in less than an hour - without having to disrupt my day.

> Needed a simple antibiotic for an ear infection which I get about twice a year. Would not prescribe anything for me, even tough that's listed as one of the benefits of the site. Today, my eardrum ruptured due to the extreme pressure of the infection, causing quite a bit of bleeding onto my neck and pillow. Would a picture of the blood convince anyone of what I needed and did not receive ??? Complained to " customer service ". Never got a response. Nothing. Time to look for another provider...<br> :date: __2020-07-10 05:29:19__
