### Description
> ACCESS HRA mobile - your benefits on-the-go!
<br>View Case Details and EBT Balances
<br>The Cases section of the app lets you view the current status of your SNAP or Cash Assistance case, the EBT balance for each of your benefits, and any upcoming Recertification dates. You can also track your Fair Fares NYC discount status, your Fair Fares NYC renewal period, or Access-A-Ride status. 
<br>View Appointments
<br>The Appointment section of the app lets you view appointments that are upcoming, missed, or completed. It also lets you add a reminder for your appointment to your phone or tablet.
<br>View Payments
<br>The Payments section of the app lets you view upcoming and past payments for your case, such as payments made to your landlord, utility company, or to your EBT card.
<br>Required Documents
<br>The Required Documents section will show you a list of the documents that you need to return to the agency to support an application, recertification, periodic report or special grant request. You can take a photo of each document or select an image from your camera roll straight from this list. Your history of documents that you have uploaded can be seen on the My Uploads screen. Each document will stay on the list for 100 days.
<br>Note: Uploaded documents must be of good quality for the Agency to review. Submitting documents does not mean that your documents prove the eligibility factor. Please visit the My Documents section to check if the Agency accepted the documents you submitted. Only documents that are listed in the My Documents section were accepted by the Agency.
<br>View Accepted Documents
<br>The Documents section of the app lets you view a list of documents the Agency received from you about your case. Each document that you submit and is accepted by the Agency stays on the list for 60 days from the date it was accepted.
<br>Profile Information
<br>The Profile section of the app provides you with the contact information and notification preferences you have previously provided to the agency. If you have a CA or SNAP case, you can only update your profile every 24 hours. If you are only a Fair Fares NYC client, you can update your profile as often as you need.
<br>Additional Information
<br>You can also get real-time notifications on your smartphone about your case, such as when your case ‘Recertification’ is due, confirmation of an online application submission, upcoming appointments, required documentation and E-notices.
<br>ACCESS HRA mobile is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Korean, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NYC Human Resources Administration |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | ACCESSHRASuppapp@hra.nyc.gov |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I like the app but I haven't been able to recertification my case online like I've been able to in the past. Right now its the only safe way for me to do so. And on the verge of losing benefits that my family desperately needs . Hope someone hears my cry for help, otherwise the app is great.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 09:15:06__

> I dl it on my iPad and have always used it and now its telling me it may not be optimized with my device .Please fix this<br> :date: __2020-10-24 22:56:58__

> Pdf uploads not allowed. Only photos.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 19:59:15__

> It's not link to my case.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 17:24:49__

> It has improved, but now i can no longer log in. It just infinitely loads after I enter my log in info. I force closed, restarted my phone and all. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 17:18:38__

> They need a feature that we can communicate with the workers. Also I was rejected because I was supposed to supply a document which was never in the required documents portion. Then when they say to call one can never get through. Just like the city to make an app where the needy can not communicate with the workers<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:08:17__

> No longer able to open app....it was very useful while it last<br> :date: __2020-10-17 10:41:41__

> It wont open<br> :date: __2020-10-14 17:46:22__

> They need more options. You can no longer upload documents through PC, which was so much easier than on mobile. It only accepts PDF as a document or you can take it through screenshot. The process itself was a pain, since as PDF I had no clue how to rotate the image to make it the right position. Whereas, I can easily do it through other applications such as paint, but it will be saved as Jpeg.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 21:59:49__

> After the update the app got worst. It's better to go into the office.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 14:45:17__
