## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> The Austrian Red Cross publishes the “Stopp Corona” app on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Health as the responsible authority of the Austrian Federal Government.
<br>„Stopp Corona“ helps you to keep track of encounters with friends, family or co-workers and save them anonymously. Should you contract the corona virus all your encounters of the last two days will be informed automatically and anonymously. 
<br>You too will be notified instantly and anonymously should one of your saved encounters report to have contracted the virus. Helping all of you to take appropriate measures such as.
<br> 
<br>- Keep a safe distance (1–2 meters) from others
<br>- Avoid social contacts
<br>- Self-quarantine as a precaution 
<br> 
<br>Together we can break the chain of infection. Not only by protecting ourselves, but also by preventing others from being infected. 
<br> 
<br>Say hello with a digital handshake
<br> 
<br>It will definitely be a while before we’ll actually shake each others hands again. In the meantime: use “Stopp Corona”s digital handshake. 
<br>If you and the person you encounter have installed Stopp Corona the app will anonymously save your meeting. Should one of you fall sick with the corona virus the other will receive an instant notification. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Self-check your corona status
<br> 
<br>How are you feeling today? Just answer the clinically proven questionnaire to check yourself for corona symptoms daily. 
<br> 
<br>Report suspected infections
<br> 
<br>Should your symptoms match those of a corona infection, you can choose to inform your encounters. This is extremely important so stop the virus from spreading. Everyone you saved in the last two days will get an anonymous notification. So don’t you worry: your personal data is safe with us. 
<br> 
<br>If you suspect to have contracted the corona virus, please stay at home and contact your attending physician via telephone. If that is not possible, call the Corona-Hotline 1450. Please do not visit your doctors office or a hospital in person!
<br> 
<br>Medical confirmation
<br> 
<br>If you are officially tested for the corona virus and your test comes back positive, please notify your encounters immediately. Of course the notification will also be anonymous. 
<br> 
<br>This app was developed in cooperation with the UNIQA foundation. 
<br> 
<br>App concept and implementation was created with the support of Accenture Austria. 
<br>The Stopp Corona App is based on the Google/Apple Framework. 
<br> 
<br>Care for you. Care for me. That’s how we protect ourselves.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

### Description
> Wat is Luscii?
<br>Luscii maakt moderne zorg mogelijk. Met de Luscii app is het op voorschrift van een zorgorganisatie mogelijk om:
<br>- lichaamswaarden/symptomen in de gaten te houden
<br>- gerichte educatie te ontvangen over (omgaan met) ziekte of gezondheidsrisico's
<br>- op afstand te communiceren met zorgverleners
<br>Hoe werkt het?
<br>- Mensen dienen zich eerst aan te melden. Dat gaat normaal via een ziekenhuis. In geval van inzet in de corona crisis is aanmelden ook mogelijk op www.olvgcoronacheck.nl
<br>- De app vraagt dagelijks een aantal lichaamswaarden of symptomen door te geven. Deze zijn gebaseerd op een door zorgverleners voor de gebruiker ingesteld programma. Ook is er educatie in de app en contact op afstand.
<br>- Achter de app staat een medisch team paraat. Dit beoordeelt de antwoorden die gebruikers geven in de app (ondersteund door de techniek van de app). Als er een medische reden is om contact op te nemen, doen zij dat binnen 24 uur. Dat kan telefonisch of via een bericht. Ook is contact via beeldbellen mogelijk (let op: deze functie gebruikt OLVG corona check nog niet).
<br>OLVG corona check
<br>- Door de uitbraak van het coronavirus neemt de zorgvraag toe. Ziekenhuizen bereiden zich hierop voor door nieuwe middelen in te zetten naast de reguliere zorg. Samen met het Amsterdamse ziekenhuis OLVG heeft Luscii daarom de Luscii app hiervoor geschikt gemaakt. We noemen dit OLVG corona check.
<br>- OLVG corona check is bedoeld om grote groepen mensen met klachten die mogelijk door het coronavirus wordt veroorzaakt op afstand te kunnen begeleiden. Een medisch team beoordeelt de metingen die binnenkomen via de app van Luscii die voor OLVG corona check wordt gebruikt. OLVG corona check is gratis.
<br>- OLVG corona check is gestart voor mensen in de regio Groot Amsterdam. Er wordt gestreefd de regio's waarin de app beschikbaar is, uit te breiden. Meer informatie is te vinden op www.olvgcoronacheck.nl.
<br>Medisch hulpmiddel en gegevensverwerking
<br>Luscii is een CE gemarkeerd medisch hulpmiddel. Gegevens worden verwerkt volgens de Algemene Verordering Gegevensbescherming (AVG). Het privacyreglement en gebruikersvoorwaarden zijn te vinden op www.luscii.com. Luscii is gevestigd in Amsterdam, Nederland.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Luscii Healthtech |
| **Website**  | [http://www.luscii.com](http://www.luscii.com) |
| **Email** | support@luscii.com |
| **Physical address**  | [Spuistraat 114A 1012 VA Amsterdam The Netherlands](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Spuistraat%20114A%201012%20VA%20Amsterdam%20The%20Netherlands) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Nougat, version 7.0 (API level 24) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Prima app. De applicatie heeft 2 meldpunten en één meldpunt in Kenia. Ik woon, werk, verblijf in Marokko. In de app wordt je doorgeleid aan het kisumu meldpunt. In Marokko kan ik hier niks mee. Overigens is in Casablanca een centraal meldpunt waar je in meerdere talen kan praten, Arabische, Frans maar ook Duits, Engels, Italiaans, Spaan. Mag ik de app ontwikkelaars adviseren om de app in meerdere talen aan de passen, óók de meldpunten toe tevoegen en interne mailadres om te antwoorden.....<br> :date: __2020-07-16 12:35:11__

> Mate van klachten kun je niet aangegeven. Ik ook andere veelgehoorde klachten. Beste medewerker, De app heeft al dagen technische problemen. Ik verwijder 'm van mijn telefoon. Waarschijnlijk bent u gestopt met uw onderzoek.  Ook uw vragen zijn inmiddels achterhaald. Ben inmiddels al 4 weken ziek, zoals zo velen met mij. Ik had hier meer van verwacht.

> Een app die niet werkt de-ïnstalleer ik in de regel meteen. Weg ermee! Maar deze, waar je elke dag je gegevens naartoe stuurt, schuif je natuurlijk niet zomaar terzijde. Een app die (mogelijk) cruciale data verzamelt en verzendt mag natuurlijk nooit falen. Misschien zijn nu al mijn ingevoerde gegevens verdwenen en heb ik voor Jan dinges meegedaan. Mocht dat zo zijn, dan was dit de 1e en laatste keer om mee te doen aan zo'n (voor mij althans) toch wel belangrijk meetinstrument, gelet op mijn fragiele gezondheid. Het kan trouwens niet bestaan dat deze app al enkele dagen eruit ligt. Er moet toch érgens een bel zijn afgegaan dat er géén meetgegevens meer binnenkomen? Ik meende dat dit professionals zijn/waren. Ik heb nu toch wel ernstige twijfels<br> :date: __2020-05-17 15:29:26__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.

| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Help slow the spread of COVID-19 by self-reporting your symptoms daily, even if you feel well.
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at King’s College London to help our health services by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the UK
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading scientific institutions like King’s College London and TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the NHS website at: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) is designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation up and down the country, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the UK has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health information, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

### Description
> Met deze app verzamelen we gegevens van Nederlanders voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar het bestrijden van het coronavirus (COVID-19). We willen beter kunnen gaan voorspellen welke zorgbehoefte er in Nederland straks is: hoeveel corona-patiënten verwachten we waar en wanneer? 
<br>Dit is een app van het Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC). Alle gegevens worden anoniem verwerkt. De geanonimiseerde gegevens worden veilig opgeslagen in Nederland. Lees hierover meer in de disclaimer. 
<br>In Nederland testen we beperkt of mensen het coronavirus hebben. We testen iemand alleen als hij/zij symptomen heeft en tot een kwetsbare doelgroep behoort. Hierdoor weten we niet precies hoeveel mensen in Nederland besmet zijn met het virus. 
<br>Door van zoveel mogelijk mensen in Nederland gegevens te verzamelen, kunnen we onderzoeken hoeveel mensen het coronavirus hebben (gehad) en waar zij in Nederland verblijven.
<br>Met deze gegevens proberen we de toekomstige zorgvraag te voorspellen: hoeveel coronapatiënten verwachten we waar en wanneer? 
<br>Uw bijdrage aan dit onderzoek is erg belangrijk om de behoefte aan zorg te kunnen voorspellen. 
<br>Help mee! Samen tegen het coronavirus in Nederland!
<br>Deze app is een initiatief van het Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC), gesteund door het Landelijk Netwerk Acute Zorg (LNAZ).
<br>Installeer de app en deel regelmatig gegevens over uw fysieke gesteldheid en die van uw huisgenoten voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Stimuleer familie, vrienden, kennissen en collega’s om hetzelfde te doen. Samen tegen het coronavirus in Nederland!

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Zinvol. Helpt ons allemaal<br> :date: __2020-05-20 12:49:53__

> Het lijkt me nuttig als je een opmerking kunt plaatsen. Ik heb nl hooikoorts en vul dus klachten in die daarbij horen, wat een verkeerde indruk kan geven.<br> :date: __2020-05-06 21:17:49__

> Goed! Dank hiervoor! Vraagje: bij het aangeven hoeveel tijd iemand buiten het huis is geweest, is de schaal alleen in uren en niet in andere tijdseenheden. Wordt dit in de toekomst nog aangepast of bestaat hiervoor geen relevantie?<br> :date: __2020-05-01 08:34:30__

> Laatste vraag over hoeveel mensen er te dicht bij kwamen invullen lukr niet altijd daar de versturen balk ervoor zit en een antwoord blokkeert.<br> :date: __2020-04-26 15:25:04__

> Sommige schuiven zijn nogal aanraakgevoelig, geeft onbedoeld verkeerde waarden. Sinds de laatste update valt de Versturen knop over de laatste schuif heen en is niet meer bereikbaar.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 21:18:13__

> Laatste vraag kan niet worden ingevuld, het veld "Versturen" staat ervoor en dus in de weg. Verder een onzinnige vraag over 5 meter afstand. Als je alleen al aan het fietsen bent, komt iedereen die je tegenkomt binnen die 5 meter....<br> :date: __2020-04-24 08:12:08__

> Heel makkelijk de app opent direct.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 19:24:13__

> Op mijn telefoon staan de 2 knoppen annuleren en bevestigen voor het balkje beroep, waardoor ik het beroep niet kan aanpassen. Ik heb het antwoord nu gelaten wat er al stond maar dit klopt in mijn geval niet.<br> :date: __2020-04-19 18:11:48__

> Ik ontvang niemand thuis en toch val ik ongunstiger uit tov het Nederlands gemiddelde in de uitslag. Dat kan beter.<br> :date: __2020-04-17 22:17:31__

> Ik werk op een PG afdeling. We hebben 21 bewoners die gewoon verzorgd moeten worden dus 1,,5 meter, onmogelijk. Tevens werk je ook als collega's dicht op elkaar. Dus het aantal mensen is meer als 20. Maar dat kan je niet invullen. Dus vraag ik me af, moet je dat nu wel of niet invullen? Want dan kom ik elke dag boven de 20 uit en vertekend dit het beeld wellicht en merk ik dat ik dus waanzinnig veel risico loop.<br> :date: __2020-04-14 20:02:38__

> Het lukt na de versoepelingen van de lockdown niet meer om de waarden in te vullen. Hoeveel mensen binnen 1.5 of 5(!) meter zijn gekomen in de supermarkt of in de stad? Geen idee!<br> :date: __2020-06-25 20:55:45__

> De vraag hoeveel mensen binnen 5 meter kwamen is niet te beantwoorden als je dagelijks een wandeling in het park maakt. 5 of 50? Ik stop ermee<br> :date: __2020-06-20 20:29:35__

> Meerdere gebruikers schreven het al : de schuifbalken zijn veel te gevoelig waardoor onbedoeld hoge waarden worden doorgegeven. Gebeurt vooral bij scrollen. Bijvoorbeeld 15 bezoekers gehad terwijl dit eigenlijk 0 had moeten zijn. Mijn inziens worden de uitkomsten dus onbetrouwbaar. Kijk het nog weekje aan, anders stop ik.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 15:13:12__

> Leek een aardige app. Kap ermee want de 5m regel is niet uitvoerbaar<br> :date: __2020-04-25 19:37:29__

> goed idee, alleen jammer dat je gelijk 'besmet' ben als je op een vraag ja antwoord, variabelen zoals hooikoorts worden niet meegenomen althans niet toen ik er mee startte, app dus verwijderd!<br> :date: __2020-04-25 17:44:07__

> Sinds laatste update zitten de navigatie knoppen over de velden in de laatste vraag te beantwoorden.<br> :date: __2020-04-24 20:54:20__

> Na de wijziging in de vraagstelling kan ik de laatste vraag niet meer beantwoorden omdat de knop 'versturen' er overheen ligt. Verder werkt het prima.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 07:21:18__

> Kan na de update/ aanpassing de laatste schuif niet gebruiken voor de laatste vraag, want daar zit de knop versturen voor<br> :date: __2020-04-22 21:24:49__

> Goed initiatief. Bij scrollen verschuiven de scores soms onbedoeld. Verbetering is noodzakelijk om geen foute scores te krijgen. Ik heb vragen die ook door anderen zijn gesteld en hoop dat antwoorden komen. In winkel en buiten let niet iedereen even goed op de 1,5 mtr. en het lukt niet altijd om zo iemand te ontwijken. Ik schat in hoe vaak dat is geweest en vul dat in. Is dat juist? Als je hoest door allergie, vul je dan "ja" in?<br> :date: __2020-04-14 09:09:26__

> mooie app. leuke update tip:. via gps als iemand in buurt komt gaat app rinkelen blijf uit buurt. of houd afstand. of meld ik was / ben ziek / ziek in buurt pas op. dit helpt<br> :date: __2020-04-14 08:29:17__

> Ik ben gestopt met invullen omdat het onmogelijk is om aan te geven hoeveel mensen binnen een straal van vijf meter zijn gekomen. De makers van de app hebben kennelijk weinig ervaring met de realiteit van het leven.<br> :date: __2020-05-26 10:22:15__

> App blijft hangen. Als ik na het beantwoorden van de vragen op versturen gedrukt heb, blijft de app aangeven dat er een nieuw bericht is.<br> :date: __2020-04-25 21:46:39__

> Hele rare nieuwe vraag: hoeveel mensen kwamen binnen 5 meter. Daar weet ik echt het antwoord niet op, die vallen buiten mijn aandacht. Die mensen op de fiets, die passeren, in de supermarkt, aan de overkant van de straat. Die tel ik niet. Zal gauw meer dan 20 zijn<br> :date: __2020-04-25 08:20:27__

> Achterliggende chronische aandoeningen worden niet meegenomen. Zou 1 alg. vraag kunnen zijn. 2. Zou thuis niet beter veranderd kunnen worden in: binnen uw erfgrens?<br> :date: __2020-04-08 09:28:40__

> Eens met vorige reviews. Zelf heb ik last van hooikoorts. Telkens bij een niesbui, vol lopen van neus, rillerigheid ga ik bij mezelf te raden of het een bekend allergie symptoom is. Misschien hooikoorts ook meenemen in app en combineren met de polleninformatie.<br> :date: __2020-04-08 08:40:21__

> Crash loop, dus kan nu niks... En waar blijven die dagelijkse meldingen, heb er pas 1 gezien!<br> :date: __2020-04-07 08:50:17__

> Vragen zijn gedateerd en veel te beperkt. Ik werd namelijk 4 weken geleden ziek en had alle symptomen, na een bezoekje aan Noord Italië. Lijkt me interessante informatie maar kan dat nergens in de app kwijt. De App heeft weinig meerwaarde... Niet installeren.<br> :date: __2020-04-06 16:03:56__

> Erg summier. Ik zou juist graag de klachten over de afgelopen periode willen omschrijven. Die begonnen op 9 maart, maar zijn nu vrijwel over. Voor mij dus niet zo zinvol deze app.<br> :date: __2020-04-04 12:57:31__

### Description
> Johns Hopkins COVID Control is a fast, user-friendly tool for controlling the spread of COVID-19 based on self-reported body temperatures and, optionally, other symptoms, from users around the country. 
<br>Designed by doctors, epidemiologists, and engineers at the Johns Hopkins University (a collaborative endeavour between the Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine and the Whiting School of Engineering, all at the John Hopkins University), this app was born out of a desire for us as individuals to make an impactful contribution in this worldwide effort to contain the spread COVID-19. 
<br>In these difficult times, while we may feel helpless as individuals, the real-time insights gained from the information entered in this app will equip our frontline healthcare workers to make more informed decisions. By downloading and using this app regularly you would be contributing to a rapidly growing collaborative effort to monitor the spread of COVID-19. 
<br>Note that submitting your data directly greatly reduces the delay experienced in hospitals/laboratories in identifying new outbreaks of the disease, and expands basic monitoring of our health.
<br>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>This app allows you to help researchers and government agencies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html
<br>This temperature information entered in this app by users across the country will be used to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in a region. By using spatial science analytics applied to these data and by comparing the observed trends against the historical data we have,  we will identify anomalous emerging activity in ILI and generate real-time, pre-clinical, risk estimates of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. 
<br>For more information about the project and this app, please visit our website https://covidcontrol.jhu.edu/


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions
