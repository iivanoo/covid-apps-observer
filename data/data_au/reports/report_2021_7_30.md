## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Up to a few days ago this was near perfect. I used it everywhere. For some reason this weekend it fails to launch on my S7 Samsung mobile. I have uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled, but still it fails to launch. Something is now incompatible. I hope it's fixed asap. UPDATE The problem is now fixed.

> App worked fine on my Moto G5 Android (8.1.0) until a week or so ago, since when it won't even open. I have just downloaded the latest version - no change. Please fix whatever you did to break it EDIT: following update 1.8.2, the app now opens and functions as before. Thanks for taking action, as the 'solution' provided to many people below was really not acceptable in 2021<br> :date: __2021-03-03 06:26:53__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's really good to have this app on your smartphone or PC but one thing to be improve is, scanning of number plate doesn't function well and can't get the job done. Please fix this as I need this function every day. Thanks for servicing NSW<br> :date: __2021-07-23 16:19:31__

> Good app with the best of intentions. 5 stars if an option to turn off the authentication screen could be added. Annoying that I have to unlock my phone, then unlock the app before I can Check In/Check Out. The double-authentication is quite redundant considering other "sensitive" apps like PayPal, MyTelstra etc simply retain your credentials between phone restarts. 22/07/21 EDIT: Bug with "nested" check-ins? I checked in at the entrance to a shopping mall, then checked in/out of the various shops I visited. When leaving the mall I couldn't do a final check-out. The Check-in history shows "(check out pending)" with no way to access it.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 05:41:39__

> Just a minor problem which might not be able to fix On Sunday I tried to check out of a business and it didn't work and needed to check in to the next shop Later that day I was checked into the 1st business again even though I had not scanned in for checking in and I was about 4 km from there and had checked into another shop for essentials I noticed yesterday that it tried to do this again to me but was able to quickly get out of the app Is there a way to delete this check in<br> :date: __2021-07-22 03:41:29__

> Very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-18 14:40:31__

> If you go to a shopping centre and scan in at the front door, and then scan in when you go in a store it will let you scan out for the store, but will not let you scan out when you leave the shopping centre. As you can't get back to the first scanned in. And says scan out pending in history.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 08:32:11__

> Can't check out of 2 places, say u go into a shopping centre, check in and go to another shop inside that shopping centre check in u can check out of that shop u just came out but can't check out of the shopping centre when u leave and sometimes when I check in to another place it comes up the last place I checked in and I have to go back to the check in screen and do it again the qld check in app has a way faster check in system open, scan, check in now done no check out b.s<br> :date: __2021-07-23 14:13:52__

> Takes too many clicks to check in. I've signed out so that I don't need to authenticate every time I check in, but now I don't have check-in history. Can't the authentication be only for parts of the app that need it like the driver's license?<br> :date: __2021-07-23 06:47:23__

> Mostassistingthank ton Thoughts k<br> :date: __2021-07-21 09:00:21__

> Would be great if COVID check-in had offline functionality. Reception is horrible in some shopping centers and check-ins are being skipped when customers can't sign into the app. Fingerprint Auth dialog is very buggy. Sometimes leaving a blank white box after successful scan.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 00:29:14__

> Why do I have to enter a pin number everytime I open this app it just slows things down.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 11:00:44__

> Please add the ability for an employee to check-in at the start of their day/shift, and then check-out at the end, instead of constantly being reminded to check out when they know they'll still be there for hours and hours.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 05:32:16__

> Hi Team,I c other people with the same issue ,I'll wait for the fix, there is a problem with the Check in and out, I checked in to the shopping centre and then Woolies but when I checked out from Woolies it cleared the shopping centre and now in the history it says that I haven't checked out from the centre and no way to check out.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 03:48:34__

> Can't add my digital license?!!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 12:57:25__

> As others have mentioned, need to improve the check out function. So many pending check outs which can't be done due to being over ridden by another check in within the complex (i.e shopping centre then store within shopping centre). Being able to check out 2 most recent check ins would be a huge improvement.<br> :date: __2021-07-18 21:25:57__

> You cant check out of a venue if you jave alreay checked in somewhere else. You need to allow users to check out venues listed in the history<br> :date: __2021-07-18 15:18:53__

> Most of the time it works OK but it has some serious bugs. 1, there has been many times I've checked in, then when I get back to the app to check out, it's not there. As if I never checked in! And yes I did get the Green Tick. 2, There is an instance I can't check out believe it or not! Checked into 2 placrs & can't check out of one of them!

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

> An amazing app where you can help find treatments for Cancer and Covid-19 and possibly help save lives. It hasn't affected my battery yet after 68 days worth of use. I only wish everyone used it on their phone.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:16:43__

> Easy to set-up and then it does its thing without any further intervention. Great to know I am helping solve these difficult projects.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 23:49:24__

> EXCEPTIONAL.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 14:46:15__

> Fight #covid<br> :date: __2021-07-26 22:59:14__

> Happy to help.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 17:03:19__

> Great app to assist universities and other institutions with peer support.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 13:08:05__

> Odd that there's a new project (AIRC Cell Identity Hunter) that says "Update to power", and yet, the newest version of the app is from the 23rd of November last year... Said project will remain at 0% until whatever version of the app it's expecting is actually pushed out.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 02:02:37__

> Solar so good<br> :date: __2021-07-22 11:49:42__

> The accrued satisfaction exceeds the frisson garnered from being a benfactrice, the essential progress in research is a reward that enriches everyone.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 13:22:29__

> Number crunching for good causes whilst you sleep is great karma. Just be warned that all that processing does mean your battery won't charge as quick or even at all if using a low power charger.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 08:24:40__

> Been using this since it launched, but at least one project says you need to update before you can help. But the app won't let me update. Does this mean eventually I will no longer be able to help fight cancer?<br> :date: __2021-07-23 10:46:33__

> Edit: since a past update, it doesn't always turn itself on when charging at 80%+. Easy to turn on manually *if* you notice. Original: Had it running fine on Android 6 & 7. Unfortunately had to change both phone and tablet! It's running equally well on 8.1 & 9. Currently using it for Covid project but will swap when it's over. If anyone used SETI@home, or uses BOINC on their PCs, it's exactly the same principle. If it stalls it's probably due to overheating so turn off & it'll be okay.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 14:03:37__

> Not 100% sure how the app actually works but I use it most days while charging my phone<br> :date: __2021-07-15 05:10:44__

> Its working fine on my Android A71. Suggestions: Some way to send info/ad about it to friends. Also an autostart or at least a reminder to start whenever phone is plugged in or at a set-able time every day.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 22:43:47__

> I've used this app for a long time now and was happy to do so but in the last month or so it randomly switches my selected contributions from cancer to Corona. It hadn't finished the phase it was working on, it just switches. I feel quite strongly about this so if it happens again it's getting uninstalled. Otherwise, the app and idea are 5 star. Vodafone and Dreamlab didn't reply to my concerns when I reached out via Twitter.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 13:40:21__

> Positive<br> :date: __2021-06-25 23:48:05__

> Easy to use and good it's good to help<br> :date: __2021-06-10 11:39:23__

> It's good to put idle resources to use. Id like the stats updated more frequently<br> :date: __2021-06-06 00:07:35__

> It's not too clear whether it's actually running in the background or not.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 16:03:53__

> This is working on a Chromebook. There should be some kind of setting to reduce performance when the device gets too hot.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 04:28:34__

> The app works well and is easy to get started with, my only concern is that my phone battery gets too hot during use even when it's already at 100%<br> :date: __2021-07-29 17:26:50__

> Why can't this app keep running in background even after screen goes to sleep?<br> :date: __2021-07-28 02:24:06__

> Thought I was doing a good thing, but it keeps defaulting back to tracking Corona and not the Cancer research that I want! Deleted it.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 17:19:01__

> spectacular to be able to make a real contribution. If only the Damm app would STOP changing what I'm contributing too. I made my decision but apparently the app knows better.....<br> :date: __2021-06-25 22:49:37__

> The idea is great, but the app could be better: it should automatically start every time the supply is pugged in, instead with my xiaomi I have to manually start the computation every time...<br> :date: __2021-05-22 20:36:56__

> Seems to resort back to the covid 2 project but hasnt completed any calcs in the last few months (Amazon Fire left on charge). Selection of other projects seems to get overwritten. Uninstalled, sorry.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 19:46:21__

> Great app & concept. Recently doesn't seem to work. Can run all night and not do a single calculation. Has been that way for a couple months now.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 09:26:55__

> It's a fantastic concept. But for all the hours I ran the app I got 3 calculations done in 20 hours I think. I don't feel I'm contributing, more than I'm just destroying the life of my phone.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 01:05:22__

> Not sure, but i think these apps will kill your battery over time .<br> :date: __2021-05-01 21:44:25__

> Been supporting the Covid-ai project for some time. No one explains how many stages are planned and stage 3 had those awkward 1 hr long calculations. No wonder Stage 4 only has 6.02% and 29k+ users, across 16 days. If there's even a Stage 5, don't expect much participance.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 17:28:48__

> It's a shame that a lot of bothersome issues are still present after such a long time. Suggestions: 1. Better tracking of contributions, possibly user-based and with highscore lists across multiple devices, which motivates additionally. 2. The app is still hardly usable on some devices. LG G8S gets so hot after a few seconds that most mornings show me not a single completed calculation. Just give us an option to run the calculations at 50% of CPU power to avoid this.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 14:44:27__

> Seems to spawn multiple copies of itself and kicks off even when the battery is still low, so phone gets hot and fails to charge properly. There seems to be no way to set a minimum battery level for it to start.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 00:14:28__

> This is a very good idea but is buggy and crashes all over. Please fix it<br> :date: __2021-07-05 20:40:59__

> I've been using this app for a while but recently it has been overheating my Nokia 5.3 too much to the point the battery is draining and I've woken up a few times to a phone that has turned itself off! This has now been uninstalled.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 04:34:42__

> The app increase the heat on the device!!<br> :date: __2021-06-04 00:29:33__

> Won't stay working on Android 11<br> :date: __2021-05-25 13:42:18__

> Reset my phone and 29k solved gone. This app needs an account you can log into so you can store your progress at least.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 05:47:23__

> I think it's a good app and I have supported it for 3-4 years but I was disappointed when I changed my phone twice now and just recently and I lost all the calculations I contributed all over this time AGAIN and they were not forwarded onto my new phone which had the same number which amounted to thousands! This is most annoying and as Dreamlab are obviously NOT concerned and are not gratefull so I am now abandoning your projects. Goodbye.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 07:54:54__

> Keeps stopping. I use a wireless charger which still seems to work but in the morning the app is closed. Over 2 days I've contributed less than 2 hours.<br> :date: __2021-04-20 08:29:26__

> Was great, now causing issues. Now causing my phone to overheat and not charge above 86%<br> :date: __2021-03-30 08:52:27__

</p>

> The concept is amazing but why force the Corona project so intensely. I'll choose a project to support, Demystify for example, and the app auto changes my selection to the Corona project. No matter how often I change it back, it continues to push that project. Completely unnecessary.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 04:33:32__

> 6 hours on and no calculations<br> :date: __2021-07-22 01:29:23__

> I've just lost mum to cancer , this App is brilliant. Using your data while you're sleeping. It's a WAY better contribution to search than hearts on a page. I'm actually doing something. Plug in charge and start the App, do it. 💗 Please stop hijacking my dream lab project. When I want to support corona virus research, I'll do it. I should be able to choose who I want to support and when.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 11:02:56__

> Revises to one star because the app is automatically changed twice the project I want to support. It chose Corona-AI (Phase 4) instead Cancer Research (Phase 2). Also no news in the news section for the last 6 months so for me app looks abandoned<br> :date: __2021-07-08 00:22:15__

> Sadly it now jumps from project to project and no longer makes any calculations.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 19:19:36__

> Revised down to one star. App constantly switches to Corona AI (Phase4) rather than the project I wanted to support (Cancer Phase 2). Have raised with DreamLab & Vodafone support. Additionally, Cancer Research (Phase 2) Project is now getting further from completion every day - now showing 18 days to completion. I've lost confidence in what was originally a great idea. 30/06/2021 - Cancer Research (Phase 2) is now showing 35 days until completion.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 06:27:53__

> 1* for ethics recently. EVERY time a new release comes, and a new Covid project is added, my choice to support a cancer project is overridden. The time in my phone is changed to what the developers want without even the courtesy of a notification. If you do not wish us to have a choice of projects be honest and don't offer it in the first place. You do a disservice to the projects you divert us away from and mislead people not carefully watching where their donation is sent. Disgraceful.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 00:09:29__

> Useless as the app stops working for no good reason. It now does appear to work. But for some reason Dreamlab restricts data download to 1gb per month. Many have Unlimited data plans so why won't Dreamlab facilitate any amount of data a donor wishes to donate?? I could if allowed donate 1000gb per month on my mobile tariff. Instead it gets to mid-month and my data donation is blocked because I have used 1gb!! It costs Dreamlab nothing to receive any amount of data from individual donors<br> :date: __2021-05-26 08:18:07__

> The App came pre installed. It's supposedly using my phone to tackle Covid whilst on charge. It seemed petty to uninstall. I was not aware that the App served any other function. I don't appreciate the little 'Well done' messages. They come over as being a bit patronising, considering that I am not actually doing anything. My self esteem isn't that low, yet 😄<br> :date: __2021-05-17 09:19:17__

> I installed and ran DreamLab with my phone a Moto G6, running Android 9, switched on and charging. Doing this caused my phone's battery to overheat, expand and force the back off of the phone. Was I supposed to switch the phone off and leave the app running in the background, or unplug the phone and leave it switched on?<br> :date: __2021-05-17 00:15:47__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again.

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__
