## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Downloading and using this app is a civic responsibility. Contrary to views expressed by conspiracy nuts and the fake news media, this is a good app, and it strikes a good balance between privacy and the need for public health officials to get data. It now incorporates a Linux Foundation sponsored open source project, which makes it even better, and the contact tracing more reliable.

> In one day (with lots of travel), 16 hours background use, 1 min active use, most battery percentage app used at 22%. And it's been for several days that's likely from the new update as some others have said. Although I just found an option to "Optimise battery usage" on as it was off before.

> From Innisfail, Qld: clubs, pubs, stores R ignoring 1.5m. Tourists & travellers in town. Displayed instructions are UNclear and scattered. I took photos of the QR Code with my Data On and no green tick appeared. Then I sent an SMS with name email and Venue. I'm taking a photo of the QR Code but nothing happens.

Ever since installing I've had BT issues with other devices not being able to reconnect, without clearing cache and data, then all other devices reconnect for a few days, then problems start again. Edit 27 Dec. 2020. Sick of this randomly burning battery. Fix it dev or will be uninstalling. We are trying to do the right thing, but this app leaves my family vulnerable with potential flat batteries on our phones, which negates usage of this app!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 01:23:22__

> Large increase in battery usage after 18th December 2020 update.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 02:18:06__

> It drains my battery like nothing else. It is great to be covid safe but if my phone dies at 2pm it doesn't help anymore. In average it takes about 20-25% of my battery which is unbearable.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 03:53:44__

> The recent 2.0 update seems to have done something to it's battery use. Judging from the feedback here, I'm not alone in noticing a marked increase in battery drain since the update. In my case, with Covidsafe on, the phone will no longer go on deep sleep/doze. It seems to have borked something with wakelocks. I adopted the app immediately on release and have repeatedly encouraged others to do the same, but in it's present state, I can no longer continue. One kludge I can think of is killing the process when not out and about, but that would require remembering to turn it back on again, which, let's face it, is a losing proposition.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 03:49:42__

> Was working just fine in background. A week or so ago it appeared to update. After that it began draining the battery. Now uninstalled. Fix it please.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 21:50:40__

> Latest update killing my battery. Really disappointing that the government decided to release a half baked update eroding the confidence of all users who are trying to do the right thing. You just can't afford to skimp on testing on such a large scale and important app.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 09:52:09__

> Unable to update. Tried numerous times.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 04:40:24__

> I was previously an advocate of this app because of the purpose of it. But since the latest update my Samsung S6 with Android 7 runs extremely hot and uses the whole battery within 4 hours. This makes both the app and the phone useless. I have turned off the location permission on this app, and now I have my phone back. The app tells me it cannot operate without location permission - I call bull, it worked fine without location services before. If it doesn't work now without the location permission, so what, it doesn't work with the location permission either. There is clearly some pretty poor coding in this version. Let me know when you fix this, until then locations stays off.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 04:10:23__

> Pathetic doesn't work not worth the effort of installing<br> :date: __2020-12-27 10:54:55__

> I wondered why my phone was suddenly unable to go a full day without charging. Turns out since the last update, this app has started using a lot more battery charge. Needs to be fixed asap or I will have to uninstall it, and I won't be the only one.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 09:04:53__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

> Cool app! I prefer this much more than writing my name down with a pen 50 other people have used that day. Great to see more places in Canberra are using it too.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:50:38__

> Red es DVR DVR you vf you have any other information you can get the best regards<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:24:49__

> Used it a few times at the library, worked quickly, easily, and without issue. Wish more places would use this.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 07:32:34__

> Now that you remember frequent guests (eg, my husband) it takes under 5 seconds to check in. Great job.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 02:09:59__

> Good job Canberra! This is more in line with the privacy requirements than signing a sheet of paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 02:40:40__

> Works really well, much better than using a google form<br> :date: __2020-10-06 11:10:27__

> Easy to use but don't just scan QR and expect app to open. The QR does nothing but open a website, thats what they mostly do. Scanning a QR will just take you to website to download. It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> Quick and easy to use, really good!<br> :date: __2020-09-27 10:53:21__

> Much quicker and easier to use than scanning a QR code to click to load a website and manually entering your details. Better security is a plus too, it'd be hard to tell if random QR code is linking to a legit website or not.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 06:20:23__

> Seems to work ok. Slow to load, requiring data connection to do so. Cannot access QR code scanner without data connection. Suggest allowing access to QR code scanner without needing data connection to allow check in, uploading locations when data becomes available.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:58:59__

Poor choice of registering option by Portrait Gallery Cafe. Portrait Gallery itself is nicely using web registration. Not to mention, this slow app is to be uninstalled after that single use. Not good enough, ACT Health.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:53:42__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> With Service NSW QR codes about to become mandatory, I'd like to see the following things to come up to five stars: - a widget to create a shortcut on your home screen directly to the QR check-in function - a persistent notification while you're checked in somewhere with a shortcut to check out - ability to save details of frequent companions so that you can quickly and easily check them in with you.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:40:57__

> A pain to set up but easy to use once it is going<br> :date: __2020-12-17 12:46:54__

> There should be only one kind of QR Scan, it is too confusing and very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:56:32__

> Easy to use, but not all Riverina venues use it. What are its limitations?<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:32:42__

> Only used it once.. it worked ok, but I had to copy and paste confirmation numbers. I don't like the way that some venues don't use the dot Gov website. You have to entrust your information with strangers. If this is law that we must comply with.. venues should use the same website. The app for ACT is less intrusive.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:23:05__

> Current HTC phone with updated Android OS. This app appears to auto update, ignoring the settings to not do so on the phone.

> The App wont work on my pure android Nokia7+ because i choose to have all permissions that can be denied...denied and still have the phone operate as a phone. My phone is factory standard and hasn't had the operating system modified in any way. The fact that I don't log in to google shouldn't prevent me from accessing my details held by the government....simple two factor authentication is all that is needed for security. So now it works.....and when it works it is handy.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 02:06:53__

> Inaccessible. Allows drivers licence scan, but not photo id or any disability related info. In other words it neglects us. Typical nsw govt attitude.

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's good to help. The only problem I have found is that when charging my phone on a Pixel Stand it will not get above 80 percent as both the app and wireless charging cause the phone to get warm.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:44:09__

> I like contributing but would like more options e.g I'd like it to only work on WiFi and I'd like the app to automatically start and work when I plug in my phone to charge....sort of download set and forget.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 17:36:43__

> Works fine on my phone, drains my wife's Samsung faster than the charger can keep up<br> :date: __2020-12-22 08:05:18__

> Great to help research while asleep<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:24:22__

> Really great cause. I would encourage everyone to use this app, it works very well too and is lightweight on data if that's a concern. No ads at all. Would be 5 stars if I could login and keep my progress/contributions across devices.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 00:21:24__

> Needs an option to suspend processing if screen is on. On some phones it's using more power than its charging so battery goes down. Need to take a leaf out of boincs book.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 13:32:20__

> Good app but settings are severely lacking, no way of telling it when to run and when not to run. I'd like to be able to customise when to start a session and also why can't it be used without being plugged in? Surely using less CPU when it's not plugged in is better than not running at all? I'd also like to see it automatically start instead of needing me to go into the app and tapping start session.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:40:48__

> Great idea... But app needs more controls to limit cpu and send it can run<br> :date: __2020-12-14 11:23:42__

> I'd like to use this on my phone but it eats power faster than the wireless charger can charge it. The phone charges up to 80%, the app starts calculating, next thing I know despite the phone still being on the charger the battery has 70% in it and still falling. The app needs to check the charge level when it is running and avoid allowing the phone to be depleted if the phone is using more power than it is getting from the charger.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:38:48__

> It is a worthwhile app, however I find if it stops due to battery temp, it doesn't automatically restart, which is not so good as I find I may only gain 15 or 20 mins running each night..<br> :date: __2020-12-10 00:04:38__

> I am on Vodafone with unlimited Max, or whatever it is called.. Around 4 months ago, the app, or Vodafone seem to have applied a 500mg per month limit to the data usage, consequently, after the first week of the month, this app remains idle! Vodafone weren't much help, other than confirming the 500mg cap exists. Not happy.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 14:25:48__

> Great idea, however it caused my Galaxy Note 10+ 5g to overheat.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:57:34__

> Great idea, but I tend to wirelessly charge my phone. This doesn't provide enough power to run the app and charge, so my phone runs out of battery while on the charger. It would be great if the app could tell the difference between wired and wireless charging.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:36:49__

> It seems like a great idea. However, I have an issue where the app appears to not be working when I move to another app or turn the screen off (the contribution amount does not increase) but is shown as running on my task manager. The app also continues to run even when the phone is unplugged. It might be that its not compatible with my Vivo x50.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 15:06:23__

> Stops calculating when charged but still plugged in, doesn't automatically start. Fix please!<br> :date: __2020-12-25 14:24:10__

> Uninstalled. Great idea, but too power intensive. Left the phone on charge over night and the battery only gained 2%.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:34:19__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> Insgesamt natürlich eine wichtige und wertvolle Idee, die App an sich hat aber noch Luft nach oben. Vorschläge: 1. Eine Option die Berechnungen erst ab einem gewissen Ladestand des Akkus zu starten. 2. Ein besseres Tracking der eigenen Beiträge, evtl. userbasiert und mit Highscore Listen (wie z.B. bei Folding) über mehrere Geräte hinweg, das motiviert zusätzlich. 3. Aktuell kaum nutzbar wenn man sein Smartphone per Schnellladefunktion lädt, weil es zu heiß wird. Hier muss nachgebessert werden.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 14:52:04__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'take a break' to cool down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again.

> Worked for about 3 days. After that, the app keeps crashing. Reinstall helped just for the first use. Now keeps crashing down again. Pity<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:12:55__

> Having to uninstall as phone runs way too hot when this is running<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:29:49__

> The idea is nice, but it drains the battery instead of having settings to work only when charging and from some battery percentage. EDIT: You say that it works only when charging, but there is no indication for it. Please update the app to show it. Also please have settings, to disallow it being used when below some percentage (I want it to stop when below 95% for example).<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:34:48__

> This app should have an option to work at 50% or even less of the processing power while not charging my phone. It doesn't really make sense when most smartphones have an ultra fast charging and doesn't need to be charged overnight. EDIT: App stopped working and doesn't do any calculations anymore...<br> :date: __2020-10-31 22:27:03__

> Interesting idea but still having issues with the app crashing.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:54:04__

> I tried the app on my phone. My phone got red hot. So I tried it on my iPad. It drained the battery completely; unfortunately even while on charge. Had to delete it. Shame. I wanted to help....<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:45:36__

> Haven't a clue what is it<br> :date: __2020-12-07 18:42:59__

> I'm sorry. I wanted to help. But my phone won't charge. It drains faster than it charging. After 1 hour it got from 86% to 80% while plugged in. It's a Samsung S7 with a fast charger. You might want to look into this.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 14:13:42__

> This app used to work perfectly but now refuses to work at all. It just claims that I've reached my data limit for the month despite the fact that I'm using WiFi. I have tried deleting it and reinstalling it several times but it still doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:21:34__

> Used to be great but now everytime I charge my phone the app crashes<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:32:30__

> I used to love this app but something in the most recent updates has been causing the phone's temp to rise and it keeps having to take a break. It never used to do that and it's to the point where the phone is hot to touch when it runs and this is when there are no other apps running in the background.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:09:32__

> Worked well for the first day, then crashed constantly every night/ charge following. Made the phone almost impossible to use prior to uninstalling due to all the crashes occurring.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:07:07__

> Idea itself is worthwhile, however after a few days the app will stop working or crash when you plug in the power. No support, no replies to messages. Constantly requires uninstalling and install if you want to continue supporting the projects, however your history/contributions are erased.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 23:10:19__

### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again. There was so many freebies it was hard not to take advantage and get motivated.<br> :date: __2018-04-12 02:16:35__

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__

> Can you please include rowing on the list of activities? The app can be a bit slow and sometimes crashes. I like the tracker and snapshot.<br> :date: __2019-04-11 21:35:52__

> it'd have been better if it could get connected to apps such as Samsung health, Google fit, strava etc and directly imported data from there...<br> :date: __2019-04-08 16:56:41__

> Before April it was working fine, but now I try to add activity or view the fitness videos and it lags and then crashes<br> :date: __2019-04-03 10:35:43__

> Wish there was a way to link to Fitbit, or Google health<br> :date: __2019-02-23 02:10:20__

> Slow to start.  Postcode summary not working. Reports 0 hrs for my postcode<br> :date: __2018-04-07 13:23:29__

> Looks good but once you try to use it, it is very slow and clunky - and my phone is moto g 3rd gen with 2GB - shouldn't have these kind of problems for this type of app for my type of phone<br> :date: __2017-04-10 14:32:10__

> Buggiest app I've got. Freezes constantly, can't click on stuff, have to constantly close and reopen.<br> :date: __2017-04-04 08:32:33__

> Very frustrating app. Lots of text looks clickable but its not. Eg the Red Activity Snapshot box. Maybe it will improve when it's live and useable. Also no Rowing option.<br> :date: __2017-03-29 14:33:34__
