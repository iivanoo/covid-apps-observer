## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Unfortunately it's back to having battery issues. clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, worked initially, allowing my phone to last more than a day again, but issues seem to have returned. Want to do the right thing and use the app, but it's killing my phones battery. Would appreciate a fix. Android system now also reported the app was draining the battery heavily. Thanks for the reply, unfortunately I am already on the latest version.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 04:22:44__

> Revising my review in 2021 (originally posted in early 2020). The app didn't work, despite the millions of dollars spend developing it. Phones that have it should have had 'hand shake'/'contact' with other phones, but so far, only four cases can actually be attributed to this COVIDSafe app. A waste of phone space, so I have uninstall it.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 04:30:14__

> Australian government, please fix your app. It drains my battery flat by the afternoon. I'm a sole trader, I must have a phone with working battery in order to get work (so that people can reach me). Currently it's 12:15pm and I still have 88% battery after uninstalling the app yesterday. If the app was running, I'd be sitting on around 50% now, draining the battery flat by 3pm. How can you ask people to use this app when you're making it impossible for them?<br> :date: __2021-02-23 03:13:40__

> Battery drainer. Had to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 21:08:44__

> Battery usage had been quite low, but today used 50%! Currently showing 0 total cases recovered (so no-one in Australia has recovered yet?) Hopefully the Bluetooth bit is working, hard for us to tell. Might be useful, but can't be sure. I've installed this app and so far haven't got Covid 19 (that I know of). Registration was easy, and can be done using a pseudonym.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:57:27__

> Yep. Got to have this app and still scan into venues. Apps don't talk to each other. What's the point.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 04:29:28__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Pros: good to know the official safe links here. Cons: it's really just a collection of web links, nothing more.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:47:47__

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> App makes check-in easy and I like how it remembers dependents for easy future check-ins. Would be nice if locations you frequented could be remembered and used in the same way for easy repeat check-ins without needing a code or to huddle around a QR code that someone had posted on the wall.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 07:37:19__

> First try today - so very relieved to have no issues at Restaurant. Guess there's no need to checkout on departure?<br> :date: __2020-12-04 03:55:33__

> Not enough businesses on it. Many still using pen and paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:00:51__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app but the biometric login is broken.... So if your fingerprint scanner and home button are built into one (as is the case on most devices) I'll place my finger on the scanner and it'll go back home not actually log me in! Frustrating especially when you're trying to check-in for covid safe every 2mins.....<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:48:36__

> Cannot access form<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:52:11__

> Works ok on newer phones but plenty of older people have pre Android 6.0 devices and guess what? Not suitable for your device message is all you get. Surely you can make it work on older devices that can't be updated?<br> :date: __2021-02-17 05:01:46__

> Frustrating.... No issues checking in but for the last 2 days it won't let me check out. Comes up with "unable to check out please try again. Physically can not check out until I check in at another location. I have been checked into one place for 15hrs until I have needed to check in somewhere else. Covid tracing data hard to get right if I am not able to check out ☹<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:32:07__

> After check in it often shuts down and I can't check out<br> :date: __2021-02-15 02:51:39__

> Checking in appears to work just fine including providing a confirmation that I'm checked in, but... When I go to check out, the check in feature has restarted and no check in was recorded. I've tried reinstalling the app and still have this issue, the rest of the app is great. The covid check in feature literally does not work. The UX could use some work also, if i've recently checked in somewhere and then I open the app, it should open up to the check out page.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 03:26:43__

> Mostly good at what it should do. The Covid check-in dad been moved to the app allowing you to scan a business' barcode. However, when the app is sent to the background, upon resumption the app's forgotten you've just checked in and brings up the confirmation of details screen again. If you proceed here, the app then checks you in again to the place you had just checked in at. Trying to check out is just as painful as once the app resumes, it again wants to check you in. It all works backwards<br> :date: __2021-02-12 02:47:57__

> Unable to load digital copy of recreational fishing licence<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:23:01__

> Having trouble getting some basic information<br> :date: __2021-02-10 02:10:39__

> Does what it needs to. With all the covid check-in I do, would be faster & easier if the covid check in feature was an app on its own.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 11:15:27__

> This app was working fine for me for almost a year then all of a sudden out of nowhere it will no longer let me in. It rejected my (correct) 4 digit code and after logging out to see if that aids the problem, it won't let me log back in. I've reset my password and I can access my account on the website, but the app still won't log me in. Despite ensuring correct log in information, I'm still being told it's incorrect. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:40:27__

> Can't log out of location very easily. Have to book in again and then log out straight away.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 01:18:36__

> Does anyone know how to add this icon onto their home page for quicker access? Fed up having to access play store to open it every time I need to sign in at places.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 23:12:15__

> I have to continuously logon to checkin or checkout. It chews my battery. I should not have to rescan the qr code for places I visit regularly. The covid checkin should have its own widget . Designed by people with no app experience.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 00:41:10__

> I am so frustrated with this app. Initially it was working with no problems, then all of a sudden it stopped allowing me to check in saying to check the accuracy of the time on my phone? I have since been trying to log in and it continues to say incorrect password even though I know it is correct as I can sign in via the web. Dead set frustrating and I still have no reason why it happened to begin with. Uninstall, here I come.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:08:09__

> I'll DC<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:42:15__

> As no data on my phone the QR code login will not work. Many places I have visited get annoyed . Some have said they will check us in, in a while but either forget or just don't. Some have said they will have no other choice but to refuse entry !. I looked this up and now know they can not do this. Again today another cafe did not sign us in !!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 11:54:27__

> Check in at a venue on a bus etc, check out. Next place I check in it loads previous location or the one before saying I haven't checked out or to check in there again. You need to sort out the bugs to make the contact tracing precise. Attention to detail is important here.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 07:26:52__

> Latest update has created check-in/out issues, unable to do either<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:52:16__

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very good easy to use I think it's a brilliant idea<br> :date: __2021-02-26 15:23:43__

> Works well on Note 8 Oreo notice I am leaving on charge more often so doing more calculations than at beginning. Excellent project. Now Note10+. Blowing my trumpet I have over 136 days 05 hrs 52 minutes calculated 33623 calculations helping several projects. Currently helping with Corona A1 phase 3. Being 68% complete needs you n me n many others to speed this & other projects up n save our lives.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 00:48:49__

> It's a nice idea but has a few things that bug me. It doesn't always connect to the server, sometimes if I reboot my phone it fixes the issue but I can't usually be bothered. It doesn't just auto run when I connect power so I often forget to start it. I hope you get to see the papers that are produced from the data you have crunched.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 13:01:58__

> I want to give this 5 stars because the idea is great. Only knocked down to 4 because it doesn't always work, starting automatically at 80% charge. Maybe this is a problem with the APIs available, but it would be good it they could find a way around it. I'd be happy if it always started when charging, even if that slows charging a bit. Maybe that could be made an option.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 09:28:14__

> Darei 5 stelle, ma non sempre l'app parte in automatico quando attacco il telefono alla presa<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:17:15__

> Can make my phone a bit hotter than I am comfortable with.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 23:03:54__

> App is good but could be better. The platform & institutions should take cues from BOINC's Android app's advance settings & notification feature. Also, as others have mentioned, you need to keep the calculations coming at a steady rate or at least inform users if there will be a slow down. BOINC institutions do this - they inform users if there will be a pause for maintenance or other reasons.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:45:34__

> I love the fact I can use this app and feel like I'm making a difference, currently I'm at home alot so when I'm not actively using my phone or I'm asleep I just let the app run, I would not recommend powering a project if your actively using the device however because it's using your phone as a processor for constant calculations it gets very hot and slows down all other stuff, but if you dont actively use your phone much while it charges it's a great tool to make a difference!<br> :date: __2021-02-09 13:29:37__

> Like helping out<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:40:23__

> Please add an option for unlimited data usage, i have an unlimited plan with a Samsung fold 2nd gen and would like more of its power to be used for a good cause<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:49:42__

> The apps really good.. Provides details and sources for the research you're helping with. Tells you the amount of time spent and problems your phone has solved. Best part is that it only works when plugged-in. So you don't have to worry about it draining your battery. The only drawback is that it kinda heats up the phone. But hey, your phone is helping humanity solve important issues without you having to anything... So pretty much a win-win.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 14:56:43__

> Only draw back is need to charge when in use<br> :date: __2021-01-28 08:50:26__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-02-24 19:10:42__

> It's ok but the app causes overheating of phone. Battery got really bloated and caused the handphone casing to bend. Was told if I replaced the screen one day, it would put extreme pressure on the battery and possibly cause the battery to explode.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 19:48:38__

> Leaves me wondering. I try to give lots of time to the calculations but sometimes I get a calc done every 10 seconds and other times every 5 mins or so. I do not feel the owners update at their end often enough. Users need to see progress if they are to stay motivated to do this work<br> :date: __2021-02-20 02:57:49__

> App has a nasty habit of switching away from the project I selected to covid-19. For those of us on an unlimited plan there is no way to set the data is can use to unlimited. I would also like more options/projects to choose from to support. Any chance you could find ones in USA?<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:32:49__

> Good idea, but only seems to run for 10 minutes a night on my phone. The rest of the time it says it's letting the phone cool - phone is stone cold...<br> :date: __2021-02-08 09:21:24__

> Great to help out but sometimes have difficulty starting a session due to 'used all daya' message<br> :date: __2021-01-30 17:01:33__

> The app is strange. Compred to folding@home it does not stimulate competition by giving you and Id, points, and the ability to gain more points by putting more devices under the same ID. Also it doesn't have any settings to allow me to use more or less resources. For instance it was initially using only one big core and now it seems to have settled for some of the little cores and I have no control over this behaviour. The app does not work in landscape mode which is very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 22:23:05__

> A great idea this but it does not automatically start calculations when I put my phone on charge. I have to manually start the calculations - it's rare I think to do so. There should be an in-app setting to allow automatic start upon plug in. 1 star lost because it's missing this obvious function. 1 star lost because without this function, the app is simply a waste of memory on my phone.

> Needs more settings. 1. Pause if screen is on. 2. Max processor %. 3. Min % battery to begin processing. For some reason the jobs become stuck with no processing occuring while clock continues - maybe a download issue, it doesn't retry though. Needs a % & time counter per job counter so we can see if it's stuck or just a long job. Phone also slows when it's processing, the % processor option may help with this.

### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again.

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__
