## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Australian Department of Health |
| **Website**  | [https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#covidsafe-app-help](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#covidsafe-app-help) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> Good application<br> :date: __2021-01-05 03:37:02__

> This needs to incorporate the ability to use QR code scanning in addition to the existing features. I avoid QR checkins due to the fact that none of the data is regulated in any way and there are just too many providers. If it could be incorporated in to the app itself it means only one registration and the QR scanning is simply to verify precisely your location at a specific time. If the QR logins can be available to contact tracers in real time it would greatly simplify the process. A notification can be sent to the user of the app that someweher they have checked in to is now an exposure site and the remaining data can be uploaded.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:26:52__

> App has started to drain my battery.... When it first came out I installed it and it only used about 1 to 2% battery in a day but now it's over 20% of my battery and I can not get a full day's use out of my phone as of this I might have to delete it as what is the point of havin git if I can not use my phone anyway if it's flat<br> :date: __2021-01-07 10:05:45__

> Great idea. Originally I couldnt keep the app open on my Oppo phone but I finally solved it. I turned off all the battery saving features as described on the Covidsafe help page, but the missing link was on the open app page, you have to swipe down on Covidsafe to lock the app. This prevents Oppo's aggressive battery management from shutting it down.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 11:49:27__

> Something seems to be seriously wrong with the current version. I was woken up this morning by my phone buzzing as it turned itself off due to 0% battery. It was 90%+ less than 7 hours ago. Battery manager shows it was the Covidsafe app that caused it. It has always hit my battery fairly hard but it's getting ridiculous now. (Update) Uninstalling, reinstalling, and clearing the cache seems to have helped. Next night I went from 100% to 83% in ~ 7 hrs.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 22:58:44__

> 2 problems with this app, not enough people are using it and it is chewing up too much of my battery. Otherwise, the app does not track my location. It keeps a log of all the installed phones I have been near for last 21 days. It does not upload this information unless I give the permission; and I will only be asked to do so in the event I had contact with someone who is infected. When I uninstall the app, all the data on my phone are deleted.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 23:49:12__

> Battery drain is caused by them implementing something called the herald protocol.1.If you have an iOS device with app on, it can use a nearby Android to find other iOS devices with the app. Ergo all users record all close contacts in the same area. 2. Location services become active when you use your phone or are looking at your screen. 3. Improves ability to get digital handshakes by continuously exchanging info like distance between contacts while users are near each other. AKA dead battery.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 15:20:58__

> I supported this application not because the Government said so, but for the good of the people that I love and for all of us. I installed the app the moment it was first released. After nearly 9 months of use I believe this app is not fit for the purpose. I am disappointed that the only thing this app does properly is draining my brand new phone battery by 38% in one day. So yes I support the initiative and the idea but cannot give higher than 1 star rating.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 12:26:25__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Cool app! I prefer this much more than writing my name down with a pen 50 other people have used that day. Great to see more places in Canberra are using it too.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:50:38__

> Red es DVR DVR you vf you have any other information you can get the best regards<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:24:49__

> Used it a few times at the library, worked quickly, easily, and without issue. Wish more places would use this.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 07:32:34__

> Now that you remember frequent guests (eg, my husband) it takes under 5 seconds to check in. Great job.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 02:09:59__

> Good job Canberra! This is more in line with the privacy requirements than signing a sheet of paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 02:40:40__

> Works really well, much better than using a google form<br> :date: __2020-10-06 11:10:27__

> Easy to use but don't just scan QR and expect app to open. The QR does nothing but open a website, thats what they mostly do. Scanning a QR will just take you to website to download. It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> Quick and easy to use, really good!<br> :date: __2020-09-27 10:53:21__

> Much quicker and easier to use than scanning a QR code to click to load a website and manually entering your details. Better security is a plus too, it'd be hard to tell if random QR code is linking to a legit website or not.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 06:20:23__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> 5 stars for the app, easy, convenient, etc, great app. One critisism though...I have two Service nsw logins, personal and my company, there is no way to switch users!

> I agree with the masks rule & wear a mask at church, in supermarkets, shopping malls etc. I visited 2 nearby malls today. At Southgate Sylvania, all adults & most children were wearing masks. I later visited Westfield Miranda & numerous older people, male and female had masks slung under their noses, some with both mouth & nose uncovered. NO idea what good they thought the masks were worn in this way! Please publicise & warn people that this is NOT correct wearing of masks.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 09:29:56__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:01:14__

> For covid check-ins, can the app please remember the details of my dependents? I'm always checking in myself and my child and usually my wife, and it remembers / supplies my details, but not those of my family, so I'm always re-entering their details. Ideally it would have a check list of previously added dependents, where I could just tick their names to add when checking in. Ideally this information would be stored locally on the device, not on the server, for privacy.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 07:17:27__

> Good app. I suggest for the covid check in an option to save your dependants. If I'm shopping and have my kids with me, everytime I enter a store I have to add them individually, an option to click on their saved names would make it so much faster and I could get in and out faster.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 04:52:33__

We went to Service NSW at Tweed Heads South today and spent the best part of an hour trying to get this rectified with absolutely no success. We kept getting a message that a code would be sent, but nothing came through for either of us. When you're in your 70s and attempting to do the right thing and the technology doesn't allow it what is one supposed to do. The suggestion that we get another phone was not at all helpful.

<br>Many health issues can be solved through Telehealth and it’s a great pre-screener to touch base with your healthcare practitioner. Sometimes, the practitioner will need to see you in person and ask you to come in for a follow up appointment, or provide you with the next steps.

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works away in the background without fuss. Nice to be able to contribute<br> :date: __2021-01-09 09:09:13__

> Once set up, this is simple to use. You must be on an unlimited tariff and wifi to make the most of it. Make sure you set the app to operate only when charging, then it is no hassle to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 11:16:02__

> Dreamlab works fine on Galaxy tab no overheating no problem no worries can leave on all day better still if worked without having to be on charge all the time thank you can you please fix this please Vodafone<br> :date: __2021-01-07 12:09:53__

> Great idea. Could use improvements to encourage more users.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 09:17:07__

> Took a while to get used to it, phone needs to be fully charged for best use otherwise battery drains rapidly. Very happy to help science.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:04:10__

> Good, but should be better. It says in the app, that you can use this just on battery when not charging - you can't. If you could I'd give it 5 stars. Otherwise fab app where you can help solve major issues and possibly help save lives. It hasn't affected my battery yet after 40 hours use.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 08:14:30__

> Please make your application's user interface compatible with Android TV and also Google TV with Chromecast. I certainly don't mind donating CPU time of my Google TV with Chromecast.

> Good concept. My problem is that it kicks in whenever the phone is charging, not desirable when plugged into a powerbank. I use my phone as cycling computer and also with maps and use a powerbank so i can have the screen on all the time. If dreamlabs kicks in it drains the powerbank and phone battery at an amazing rate. It would help if it was possible to define the time period when dreamlab is active so it is restricted to overnight charging time.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 09:22:17__

> Needs a progress bar/% as while some jobs take several minutes, others go on for hours and it's not clear if it's frozen or not. 12 calculations over 10hrs on a snapdragon 865?Needs an option to suspend processing if screen is on. On some phones it's using more power than its charging so battery goes down, therefore needs an option to reduce processor % to counter this + % battery required before activating. You guys definitely need to take a few leaves out of boincs book. Poco F2 pro android 11<br> :date: __2021-01-07 13:56:27__

> Not as configurable as BOINC eg scheduling work. Too many thumb's up notifications. Can't adjust CPU usage.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 18:08:25__

> Good app but settings are severely lacking, no way of telling it when to run and when not to run. I'd like to be able to customise when to start a session and also why can't it be used without being plugged in? Surely using less CPU when it's not plugged in is better than not running at all? I'd also like to see it automatically start instead of needing me to go into the app and tapping start session.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:40:48__

> Great idea... But app needs more controls to limit cpu and send it can run<br> :date: __2020-12-14 11:23:42__

> I'd like to use this on my phone but it eats power faster than the wireless charger can charge it. The phone charges up to 80%, the app starts calculating, next thing I know despite the phone still being on the charger the battery has 70% in it and still falling. The app needs to check the charge level when it is running and avoid allowing the phone to be depleted if the phone is using more power than it is getting from the charger.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:38:48__

> It is a worthwhile app, however I find if it stops due to battery temp, it doesn't automatically restart, which is not so good as I find I may only gain 15 or 20 mins running each night..<br> :date: __2020-12-10 00:04:38__

> I am on Vodafone with unlimited Max, or whatever it is called.. Around 4 months ago, the app, or Vodafone seem to have applied a 500mg per month limit to the data usage, consequently, after the first week of the month, this app remains idle! Vodafone weren't much help, other than confirming the 500mg cap exists. Not happy.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 14:25:48__

> Great idea, however it caused my Galaxy Note 10+ 5g to overheat.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:57:34__

> Great idea, but I tend to wirelessly charge my phone. This doesn't provide enough power to run the app and charge, so my phone runs out of battery while on the charger. It would be great if the app could tell the difference between wired and wireless charging.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:36:49__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> Insgesamt natürlich eine wichtige und wertvolle Idee, die App an sich hat aber noch Luft nach oben. Vorschläge: 1. Eine Option die Berechnungen erst ab einem gewissen Ladestand des Akkus zu starten. 2. Ein besseres Tracking der eigenen Beiträge, evtl. userbasiert und mit Highscore Listen (wie z.B. bei Folding) über mehrere Geräte hinweg, das motiviert zusätzlich. 3. Aktuell kaum nutzbar wenn man sein Smartphone per Schnellladefunktion lädt, weil es zu heiß wird. Hier muss nachgebessert werden.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 14:52:04__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'take a break' to cool down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again.

### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again.

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__
