## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Disclaimer

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App working again since update 1/3/2021.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 02:19:18__

> Great app to use! Only have to enter your details once at setup, unlike interstate arrangements. Just a simple click to check in at arrival, no check out required. Just needs more extensive testing before updates are released.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 22:40:12__

> Once loaded this app is easy to use, so much easier than NSW or Vic!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 00:06:07__

> Was easy to install particularly for a tech challenged person. Only issue is that does not allow me to check out unlike the nsw app<br> :date: __2021-02-12 01:47:53__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Update 4/4/21: Thanks for prompt & helpful developer response. I understand my earlier review in Jan was during a temp outage; Updates and check-ins since have gone well. [Jan review: Couldn't use CovidSafe check in on multiple attempts, as verification code/s to mobile took ~1 hour to arrive (after shop closed) - signal wasn't an issue. Not sure if this is an app problem or somewhere else in Service NSW's system, but its most important function needs to properly work.]<br> :date: __2021-04-04 11:45:30__

> It was ok<br> :date: __2021-04-03 01:27:54__

> Not that smart. I already have my digital license on the apps for a while but when I select for NSW $100 voucher, still asked me to manually put back my Drivers license details & address. It makes me think for a while that my details are compromised. Also need to provide 1 more documents (e.g. passport, Medicare etc) to claim it. Hope this is a very secure apps.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 21:16:14__

> Congrats .gov.au Compared to the rest of the world, you did good. Pat yourself on the back... Public servants in aps levels that actually worked for the public did really well.

Now forgets all the work done by those who knew what they were doing'<br> :date: __2021-04-01 13:53:19__

> Good App. But QLD app for QR Code is better , QLD government sign in System enables you to create QR codes for different venues belong to one ABN & Address while only change the venue name/discreption which make sense if you own large site with multiple venues belong to the same address & ABN. sorry that's made me feel jealous of QLD 😊.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 14:27:51__

> Check in not currently working. Well let you check in, but when you go to check out there is no record of check-in. Shows previous one instead.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 00:57:08__

> Dark mode is a joke. When I go to check out of the covid safe check in, I can't see the time at all. So if I forget to check out of a venue, and try to check out later, can't see the time. So I just reverted back to light mode.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 04:19:12__

> Like all of No Service NSW, it does not work properly and gets worse with every iteration. Now it won't let me qr in unless I log into it first, before scanning. Plus I had to re-enter my details again. Why can't we go back to private ones that worked?<br> :date: __2021-03-22 23:12:46__

> I have applied for dine n discover vouchers and they display in the app. But unless you search a specific postcode or suburb it's useless, why can't the map show all businesses near ne not just a searched suburb?

> Only works at some shops<br> :date: __2021-04-02 08:34:01__

> Thank you for your response, but what I meant was all the categories are visible, only the bottom half of each category label is visible, they have no top. Why would the app only work properly on a mobile and not a tablet? Android and iOS both operate on mobile phones and tablets. Some tablets can make phone calls. The feedback section does not work on either phone or tablet. Also, it would be nice if the screen could be rotated.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 06:11:01__

> I felt the person I was talking to was not friendly and after waiting for 40 minutes the person hung up on me. Very poor service.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 02:03:00__

> Frustrating, took five goes to get acceptance for the vouchers. I finally got the go ahead & that I would receive a email with the vouchers. I did & was able to download them on the computer, but on the service app. the vouchers do not appear...just says let's get started. Annoying. Will try that site for help<br> :date: __2021-03-29 07:08:50__

> Has worked fine until a few days ago, it has logged me out and says 'incorrect email or password'. I have reset my password, uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous time but nothing fixes the issue. I can log onto the Service NSW website with no problems, so the password is not the problem, it is a glitch with the app<br> :date: __2021-03-27 02:31:31__

> I'd l like to give this app five stars as it has functioned well in the past, but now it refuses log in on my mobile phone because my "device may be using non-standard software" and "for your security" I am not allowed to log in. Why is the NSW Government now dictating what I can or cannot do with my own personal device? Does this mean I need to spend hundreds of dollars on a new device simply to claim my $100 voucher? Or revert back to unsafe insecure out-dated official software?<br> :date: __2021-03-21 13:47:34__

> This apps has some frustrating bugs, particularly when it comes to checking out of venues. For instance, I'm currently unable to check out of my last venue because 'PM' times are not available. Instead, the two options available are 'AM' and 'AM'. In a previous occasion, the number '5' from missing from the list of hours, so I had to use 4:59 to be able to check out. This seriously baffles me and I expect a far better standard, especially as we are required to use this app.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:38:12__

> UPDATE ON REVIEW: After a bumpy March '21update caused appointment fail for my doc booking, I reported the problem and developer was attentive and gave advice. I will need to await my next booking before I can report it as fixed. Hope. Updated & failed.. what a shame the March '21 update caused the booking appointment service to become inactive.

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is useful. Covid 19 Stage 4 though needs some tinkering: my battery temp is going up to 38 celcius and it is really sucking up my cpu on Samsung A50. I can't run other apps like Spotify and games without massive lag. Edit :maybe Dreamlab can do a push notification to encourage people on phase 3 to join phase 4.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 16:03:16__

> I sometimes forget it's there, since it runs in the background. Is simple, and great premise. Help cure diseases by simply plugging in your phone. The one nitpick I have with it, is if I optimize my phone with the Device Care, I will have to open the app manually next time to get it to work. After that one time, I do t have to touch it again until the next optimization.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 19:24:48__

> Dreamlab works fine on Galaxy tab no overheating no problem no worries can leave on all day better still if worked without having to be on charge all the time thank you can you please fix this please Vodafone now working on Galaxy A50 fine 🙂 🥰😆<br> :date: __2021-03-25 23:23:18__

> Works away on my phone overright while charging. If, as occassionally happens the phone gets too hot, it takes a break till the phone cools down. Good for me<br> :date: __2021-03-22 12:32:11__

> This app is a fantastic idea, but I wish it would start automatically, rather than replying on me switching it on each night. Sadly, I often forget.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 18:20:01__

> a great way to help the fight when you can't donate money or time. Love the idea of the app, only problem is that the app doesn't always automatically turn on when on charge and hits 80%.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 13:56:20__

> A really good app, shame it doesn't run all the time, using less power and slower processing when not in charge. Not keeping track of overall progress on Samsung S10.

> Good app with great intentions. The problem is that the program I chose keeps getting switched for another program which I do not wish to support. All. Trying to do is support coronavirus research and the app keeps trying to make me support hyperfoods which is suspiciously run in the UK.

There is no option to disable dreamlab, sometimes I just want to charge my phone and not run the app. It frequently gets stuck on 1 job and doesn't do anything all night.

### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Better+Health+Channel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Better+Health+Channel) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again.

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct.
