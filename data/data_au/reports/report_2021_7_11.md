## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let’s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you’ve had with other users by securely logging the other user’s reference code. If you or someone you’ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used—with your consent—by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who’ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>• Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>• Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>• Turn on Bluetooth®
<br>• Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>• If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you’ve been exposed to the virus by someone you’ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Migration Council Australia |
| **Website**  | [https://migrationcouncil.org.au/](https://migrationcouncil.org.au/) |
| **Email** | info@migrationcouncil.org.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Up to a few days ago this was near perfect. I used it everywhere. For some reason this weekend it fails to launch on my S7 Samsung mobile. I have uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled, but still it fails to launch. Something is now incompatible. I hope it's fixed asap. UPDATE The problem is now fixed. Thanks for the support.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 10:20:44__

> App worked fine on my Moto G5 Android (8.1.0) until a week or so ago, since when it won't even open. I have just downloaded the latest version - no change. Please fix whatever you did to break it EDIT: following update 1.8.2, the app now opens and functions as before. Thanks for taking action, as the 'solution' provided to many people below was really not acceptable in 2021<br> :date: __2021-03-03 06:26:53__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Service+NSW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Service+NSW) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App won't let me log in after last update. suggests there is an issue with my app or device, and refers me to service nsw gov au slash non-standard-software Decided is play certified, and there are no detected issued when scanning with the play protect in the play store. Can only check in as a guest. Kogan Agora xs, running android 8.1.0<br> :date: __2021-07-11 08:38:10__

> Good app with the best of intentions. 5 stars if an option to turn off the authentication screen could be added. Annoying that I have to unlock my phone, then unlock the app before I can Check In/Check Out. The double-authentication is quite redundant considering other "sensitive" apps like PayPal, MyTelstra etc simply retain your credentials between phone restarts. 11/07/21 EDIT: despite the developer's reply the app is *not* improved in the area described above.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 03:38:04__

> As pensioners my wife and I only have one phone. when we check in does this cover both us since there is no way to create separate qr codes on the same phone.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 07:46:59__

> With shopping centers now requiring checking it would be good to have multi check ins for some sites. Go to Westfield woolies, checking to Westfield then woolies, I can't check back into Westfield's on the way out??<br> :date: __2021-07-11 05:05:00__

> Now that we must sign into every single place we go, it really is essential that complications such as double sign in are removed, it just takes too much time and guaranteed this is reducing compliance. Separate the COVID app from other service NSW functions if necessary and have it start up straight to QR scanner. Must have an easier way of checking out of somewhere such as a persistent notification with instant checkout button.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 03:48:23__

> Today it wouldn't let me use the shortcut icon on my home screen, opening the app and displaying a security message about my phone not being trusted, and logging me out. Resolved that by clearing all data and restarting, logging back in. But the shortcut icon is gone, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get it back. Release notes?<br> :date: __2021-07-10 07:24:54__

> Annoying method of covid check-in. Why is it necessary to first having to sign it to app before you can scan covid? It should be a one tap action so you don't have to stand and fiddle to check in!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 04:44:37__

> App is slow, login screen should display a numpad not the full keyboard because the password is only numeric. Such a small thing that's a huge hindrance when i have to sign in everywhere<br> :date: __2021-07-10 00:25:29__

> Won't let me log in despite same login details on my laptop being confirmed. I can't believe your IT ppl get paid to work. Then despite me being logged ok on laptop, blocked me out with a 30 minute lockout warning and still won't let me log in on app!!! Arrrgghhhh!!!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 04:48:11__

> I have exactly same experience with you Terry. NSW should develop this how can be easier to use, In term of managing, changing or editting account infor consider about many of seniors among us use phone just for basis use.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 01:32:05__

> The problem is, the app keeps asking for pass word, that is annoying<br> :date: __2021-07-09 23:25:45__

> I had this app a month ago it was good I had all my licenses on tap then I was locked out . I can still check in to places for covid but every thing else is blocked. I rang the number that was supplied and was transferred three times, so I just gave up. Get you're act together .Robert.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 17:12:47__

> Why do i have to sign in everytime. A better option would be to tap the app and you go to qr code and checkin. If you want to do something else on the app then you sign in. Too much waiting for people in the long line to checkin. Come on make it quicker and more people will checkin. The latest update said it would be easier to checkout but not on my samsung s9.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 08:32:00__

> Often fails to allow me to log in which will be a huge problem when check in becomes compulsory next week. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 23:43:34__

> Sort of good. But can't use the covid check-in if I'm signed in for some reason. I don't have a driver's licence to store in it but would like to see my check-in history. I'm now having to take screenshots of my check-ins just incase it's not being stored anywhere<br> :date: __2021-07-07 00:34:11__

> On Covid SignIn - QR is great for first sign in at venue, but when I go to same work, cafe, supermarket regularly can we just have a favourites list that uses location services to sort to closest and sign in without fiddling with QR scanner? Also having inside secure section of service NSW app means I need to enter passcode in phone, open app, add passcode to app, click covid button. You are forcing me to hover around a common QR and spend longer in potential contact locations which is uncool.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 00:18:24__

> I've made 2 app requested feedbacks now to no response, about major bug issue with the Covid Safe QR code check in function of the app. The issue is that regardless of signing into a business, and also sign out. The next time you sign into another business, it more often then not brings up a previous business you've signed into, but it gets confused and thinks you're signing in again, even of its a different day, at a wildly different time frame parameter. And it's been happening a lot!<br> :date: __2021-07-11 12:39:09__

> The app cannot remember my details for the covid check-in and I have to re-enter them every single time I check-in to a new location, yet it has no trouble remembering my dependents details. This is extremely frustrating in a shopping centre where you are entering and exiting many places. The ACT app by comparison is really simple and easy to use, and much quicker at checking in.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:04:39__

### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Its working fine on my Android A71. Suggestions: Some way to send info/ad about it to friends. Also an autostart or at least a reminder to start whenever phone is plugged in or at a set-able time every day.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 22:43:47__

> I've used this app for a long time now and was happy to do so but in the last month or so it randomly switches my selected contributions from cancer to Corona. It hadn't finished the phase it was working on, it just switches. I feel quite strongly about this so if it happens again it's getting uninstalled. Otherwise, the app and idea are 5 star. Vodafone and Dreamlab didn't reply to my concerns when I reached out via Twitter.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 13:40:21__

> Positive<br> :date: __2021-06-25 23:48:05__

> Easy to use and good it's good to help<br> :date: __2021-06-10 11:39:23__

> It's good to put idle resources to use. Id like the stats updated more frequently<br> :date: __2021-06-06 00:07:35__

> It's not too clear whether it's actually running in the background or not.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 16:03:53__

> This is working on a Chromebook. There should be some kind of setting to reduce performance when the device gets too hot.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 04:28:34__

> Sometimes the number of calculations is zero. Uninstalling and reinstalling usually works. Otherwise worthwhile app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 10:08:34__

> Thought I was doing a good thing, but it keeps defaulting back to tracking Corona and not the Cancer research that I want! Deleted it.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 17:19:01__

> spectacular to be able to make a real contribution. If only the Damm app would STOP changing what I'm contributing too. I made my decision but apparently the app knows better.....<br> :date: __2021-06-25 22:49:37__

> The idea is great, but the app could be better: it should automatically start every time the supply is pugged in, instead with my xiaomi I have to manually start the computation every time...<br> :date: __2021-05-22 20:36:56__

> Seems to resort back to the covid 2 project but hasnt completed any calcs in the last few months (Amazon Fire left on charge). Selection of other projects seems to get overwritten. Uninstalled, sorry.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 19:46:21__

> Great app & concept. Recently doesn't seem to work. Can run all night and not do a single calculation. Has been that way for a couple months now.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 09:26:55__

> It's a fantastic concept. But for all the hours I ran the app I got 3 calculations done in 20 hours I think. I don't feel I'm contributing, more than I'm just destroying the life of my phone.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 01:05:22__

> Not sure, but i think these apps will kill your battery over time .<br> :date: __2021-05-01 21:44:25__

> Been supporting the Covid-ai project for some time. No one explains how many stages are planned and stage 3 had those awkward 1 hr long calculations. No wonder Stage 4 only has 6.02% and 29k+ users, across 16 days. If there's even a Stage 5, don't expect much participance.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 17:28:48__

> Getting worse. Great premise, but the app is unreliable. Being greeted by a notification saying " well done you powered this for 7 and a half hours and completed zero calculations" makes you wonder what the point is. It used to be much more reliable.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 11:56:46__

> A really good app, shame it doesn't run all the time, using less power and slower processing when not in charge. Not keeping track of overall progress on Samsung S10. I have to clear everything to see how much progress has been made. Reported a while ago but still not fixed<br> :date: __2021-04-03 07:55:06__

> It's a shame that a lot of bothersome issues are still present after such a long time. Suggestions: 1. Better tracking of contributions, possibly user-based and with highscore lists (compare Folding) across multiple devices, which motivates additionally. 2. The app is still hardly usable on some devices. LG G8S gets so hot after a few seconds that most mornings show me not a single completed calculation. Just give us an opportunity to run the calculations at 50% of CPU power to avoid this.<br> :date: __2021-06-24 10:21:54__

> I've been using this app for a while but recently it has been overheating my Nokia 5.3 too much to the point the battery is draining and I've woken up a few times to a phone that has turned itself off! This has now been uninstalled.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 04:34:42__

> Won't stay working on Android 11<br> :date: __2021-05-25 13:42:18__

> Reset my phone and 29k solved gone. This app needs an account you can log into so you can store your progress at least.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 05:47:23__

> I think it's a good app and I have supported it for 3-4 years but I was disappointed when I changed my phone twice now and just recently and I lost all the calculations I contributed all over this time AGAIN and they were not forwarded onto my new phone which had the same number which amounted to thousands! This is most annoying and as Dreamlab are obviously NOT concerned and are not gratefull so I am now abandoning your projects. Goodbye.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 07:54:54__

> Keeps stopping. I use a wireless charger which still seems to work but in the morning the app is closed. Over 2 days I've contributed less than 2 hours.<br> :date: __2021-04-20 08:29:26__

> Revises to one star because the app is automatically changed twice the project I want to support. It chose Corona-AI (Phase 4) instead Cancer Research (Phase 2). Also no news in the news section for the last 6 months so for me app looks abandoned<br> :date: __2021-07-08 00:22:15__

> Sadly it now jumps from project to project and no longer makes any calculations.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 19:19:36__

> Revised down to one star. App constantly switches to Corona AI (Phase4) rather than the project I wanted to support (Cancer Phase 2). Have raised with DreamLab & Vodafone support. Additionally, Cancer Research (Phase 2) Project is now getting further from completion every day - now showing 18 days to completion. I've lost confidence in what was originally a great idea. 30/06/2021 - Cancer Research (Phase 2) is now showing 35 days until completion.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 06:27:53__

> 1* for ethics recently. EVERY time a new release comes, and a new Covid project is added, my choice to support a cancer project is overridden. The time in my phone is changed to what the developers want without even the courtesy of a notification. If you do not wish us to have a choice of projects be honest and don't offer it in the first place. You do a disservice to the projects you divert us away from and mislead people not carefully watching where their donation is sent. Disgraceful.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 00:09:29__

> Useless as the app stops working for no good reason. It now does appear to work. But for some reason Dreamlab restricts data download to 1gb per month. Many have Unlimited data plans so why won't Dreamlab facilitate any amount of data a donor wishes to donate?? I could if allowed donate 1000gb per month on my mobile tariff. Instead it gets to mid-month and my data donation is blocked because I have used 1gb!! It costs Dreamlab nothing to receive any amount of data from individual donors<br> :date: __2021-05-26 08:18:07__

> The App came pre installed. It's supposedly using my phone to tackle Covid whilst on charge. It seemed petty to uninstall. I was not aware that the App served any other function. I don't appreciate the little 'Well done' messages. They come over as being a bit patronising, considering that I am not actually doing anything. My self esteem isn't that low, yet 😄<br> :date: __2021-05-17 09:19:17__

> I installed and ran DreamLab with my phone a Moto G6, running Android 9, switched on and charging. Doing this caused my phone's battery to overheat, expand and force the back off of the phone. Was I supposed to switch the phone off and leave the app running in the background, or unplug the phone and leave it switched on?<br> :date: __2021-05-17 00:15:47__

> Infringement.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 17:54:55__

### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Better Health Channel |
| **Website**  | [https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/](https://www.activeapril.vic.gov.au/) |
| **Email** | activeapril@sport.vic.gov.au |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Better+Health+Channel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Better+Health+Channel) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again. There was so many freebies it was hard not to take advantage and get motivated.<br> :date: __2018-04-12 02:16:35__

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__

> Can you please include rowing on the list of activities? The app can be a bit slow and sometimes crashes. I like the tracker and snapshot.<br> :date: __2019-04-11 21:35:52__

> it'd have been better if it could get connected to apps such as Samsung health, Google fit, strava etc and directly imported data from there...<br> :date: __2019-04-08 16:56:41__

> Before April it was working fine, but now I try to add activity or view the fitness videos and it lags and then crashes<br> :date: __2019-04-03 10:35:43__

> Wish there was a way to link to Fitbit, or Google health<br> :date: __2019-02-23 02:10:20__

> Slow to start.  Postcode summary not working. Reports 0 hrs for my postcode<br> :date: __2018-04-07 13:23:29__

> Too slow to start up. What is it doing. ? Would track more time but it's tomorrow by the time the app has dtarted<br> :date: __2018-04-02 10:52:17__

> Looks good but once you try to use it, it is very slow and clunky - and my phone is moto g 3rd gen with 2GB - shouldn't have these kind of problems for this type of app for my type of phone<br> :date: __2017-04-10 14:32:10__

> Buggiest app I've got. Freezes constantly, can't click on stuff, have to constantly close and reopen.<br> :date: __2017-04-04 08:32:33__

> Very frustrating app. Lots of text looks clickable but its not. Eg the Red Activity Snapshot box. Maybe it will improve when it's live and useable. Also no Rowing option.<br> :date: __2017-03-29 14:33:34__
