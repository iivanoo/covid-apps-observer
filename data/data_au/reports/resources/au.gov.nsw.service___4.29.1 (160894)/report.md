## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My wife has tried to download the NSW Service App to comply with Covid 19 check-in ans check-out new rules. Her mobile phone is a Samsung S5, not too old bit certainly not the latest mobile phone on the market. Download failed after attempting many times. After some research I have found that Mobiles need to be operation on Android 6. My wife's phone operates on Android 4.4.4 and cannot be updated, this confirmed by speaking to a Samsung help line earlier today. We are both in out late 60's and are not prepared to buy new phones. What can be done?<br> :date: __2020-11-22 07:39:19__

> Hard to link services<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:58:25__

> It is useful having this information handy, especially the driver's licence.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 09:45:52__

> Great app only 1 complaint, every single qr check in I try to do does not work?<br> :date: __2020-11-14 02:42:54__

> Wait until you get on your own network if it won't work for you<br> :date: __2020-11-12 09:52:04__

> My QR code usage has been working well until today. How do I get it working again?<br> :date: __2020-10-29 05:48:08__

> Simple and easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 15:12:54__

> It's a good app but one thing that really is annoying is that you can not check Historic Plates so if you own a old vehicle with Historic Plates don't wast your time downloading it. On the other hand it is a great app. Please Fix It!! When it is fixed I will rate 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 10:11:04__

> Need it<br> :date: __2020-09-27 01:55:00__

> No worries. Nice staff<br> :date: __2020-09-17 03:30:59__

> I thought Service NSW was offering a QR reader download. I can find lots of support for businesses, but do you offer a QR reader for citizens like me?? If so, how do I find it?<br> :date: __2020-11-23 04:42:31__

> State government is encouraging residents to use the Services NSW app to scan in, but the QR reader doesn't work anywhere, and I mean anywhere. How ridiculous not to have a integrated system. Clearly lacked end user experience testing.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 07:35:37__

> I have been using digital license since it is available has worked for couple of emergency situation but it cannot replace the card completely. For an example- when we use license for identity purposes, some websites ask for the number on the back of the card which is not available in digital version!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:36:43__

> Not much to explore 🙄<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:35:13__

> Why can't I down load the app and keep it on my screen<br> :date: __2020-11-17 02:45:30__

> All good except the driver license page freezes and the app becomes unresponsive on my phone<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:47:16__

> App freezes on my pixel 3a at license display. Can't check in to a venue or prove the license isn't a screenshot as app freezes there every single time even after a reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:27:03__

> Injusticemmm, mNwe,yy5566iuiuuuuii. Because k<br> :date: __2020-09-20 00:32:33__

> Hopeless took bloody 3 days of attempts to get a activation code finally. Reinstalled app and got it to work.<br> :date: __2020-09-16 03:28:38__

> Keeps freezing when digital licence is loaded<br> :date: __2020-11-21 00:33:15__

> 3 hours to try and down load the app and it times out. Have tried over 4 days and it still wont download.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 01:59:06__

> The app freezes when I access my driver's licence. This is a new development over the last week or so. Running Pixel 3a with latest operating system and app is up to date.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 00:02:56__

> This app doesn't recognise my email address. I have an account with RMS. It wouldn't recognise my password. It all started trying to get a mobile app for sighning in for covid with my camera<br> :date: __2020-10-20 03:35:39__

> Unable to scan my fingerprint. Doesn't appear to be working?<br> :date: __2020-10-19 02:20:04__

> Very good 😊<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:17:55__

> No way in if you forgot your password. It sends you a one time code but that opens and logs you in on the web. When you switch back to the app you're still logged out. Frustrating<br> :date: __2020-09-11 13:06:28__

> Memory hog, big time.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 01:24:23__

> Ridiculous as it doesnt work on rooted phones. I have my banking app which works on my phone which I really should be concerned more about of it's security leaks than your frustrating app! So next time when you push an update please disable "root check".<br> :date: __2020-07-26 13:06:33__

> Why is it that you can send a push to tell me that I'm not allowed over the border for covid but you can't push notifications to suggest that there is an expiring registration or a traffic infringement or anything that is important and time critical?<br> :date: __2020-07-23 07:47:39__

> Unable to do anything directly through the app without calling. This includes digital licence and covid check-in<br> :date: __2020-11-21 04:15:50__

> Says I should upgrade in the store, but no upgrade button for selection. If you click open (install button not active) it just goes to app again saying to upgrade.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 22:56:37__

> Was working great for months until it randomly told me my device is using nonstandard software and blocked my device from logging in? Now it is useless to me. Would appreciate a fix.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:29:01__

> I can't even sign up it keeps going around in circles once I try n put my ph number in ..<br> :date: __2020-11-17 04:25:57__

> Can not even start an account .App just keeps taking me back to enter my email after sending a code. Uninstalled... it's terrible<br> :date: __2020-11-17 01:19:36__

> This app is useless for covid because NO venues use it! Now I need to give my details to random 3rd party providers.. who knows who they are selling my info too.. Wake up state gov and put in data privacy protections.. we want to be safe but....not when I open myself up to identify fraud every time I go to a venue.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 20:47:46__

> Don't lock out users of 'nonstandard software'. Some of your citizens prefer to have an actually-secure non-corporate-spyware OS on their phone. Also, your login screens are not using the appropriate input fields for email and numeric entry, which makes entering this data more tedious than it has to be. And your feedback form CAPCHA is broken. Overall the kind of amateurish outsourced effort one expects from Australian governments. :-/<br> :date: __2020-11-16 20:39:00__

> Minus 50 stars. Need digital drivers licence so car rental company can see my licence is valid. Make several attempts over 3 days to reset my password. I don't receive a single Email. I phone and hold 20 minutes for no answer. Branch then tells me after queuing to visit that "The system is down". System is beyond broken.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 03:25:09__

> Many venues are not using your QR print out..<br> :date: __2020-11-15 23:54:23__

> Crashes all the time, especially when filling in important information.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:33:41__
