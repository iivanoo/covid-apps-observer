## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great, easy to use better than the Victorian app<br> :date: __2021-06-15 06:47:08__

> Good app with the best of intentions. 5 stars if an option to turn off the authentication screen could be added. Annoying that I have to unlock my phone, then unlock the app before I can Check In/Check Out. The double-authentication is quite redundant considering other "sensitive" apps like PayPal, MyTelstra etc simply retain your credentials between phone restarts.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 01:45:06__

> ok<br> :date: __2021-06-18 01:45:48__

> To complicated<br> :date: __2021-06-14 06:02:15__

> It's a good app but I keep running into issues where if I login with the fingerprint reader on my Samsung S21 Ultra, the fingerprint overlay doesn't disappear and blocks me using the rest of the app. The only way to fix it is to force close the app and re-open which is frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-06-13 05:44:05__

> No can do<br> :date: __2021-06-12 06:12:48__

> Update being annoying as it is not going to address straight away but back to app?? Have to scan more than once.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 05:32:08__

> User friendly<br> :date: __2021-06-12 02:49:31__

> Whilst the app has good intentions, I can not get the vouchers on my phone through the app, I also can not do the covid check in with it, it tells me to check the time on my phone.... the time is exactly the same as everybody else's. I think the app was intended for the more common type of phones such as Samsung, nokia and the such.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 01:57:17__

> Not very user friendly, takes too long to login etc.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 01:51:30__
