## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Check in is easy<br> :date: __2021-01-23 11:42:33__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-23 05:24:25__

> Generally works well. However, some more improvements would be great: 1: face unlock for devices with this functionality to save typing in PIN for check-in and check-out. 2: move the COVID Safe Check-in higher up the screen for all OSs (surely these days the COVID check-in is more important and used far more often than checking your registration details!). 3: Status bar on top of other apps to remind you to checkout. Also, my Pixel 4XL camera doesn't open the app - time consuming and tedious!<br> :date: __2021-01-22 23:20:03__

> Tops<br> :date: __2021-01-22 21:58:40__

> Easy to use. Would be even better to move the Covid QR code closer to the top of the page or have the option to create shortcut to open the QR code scannon the mobile's Home<br> :date: __2021-01-22 11:37:31__

> Works well enough. For checkins, it would be great if the sms code that's sent was input automatically into the app like in many other modern apps. This would save so much trouble looking up the code and typing it in.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 09:09:40__

> Covid Check Ins... Will bump to 5 stars if you release an update to store/autofill First/Last/Phone for all dependants. I have a big family ;)<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:45:31__

> Very glad gov check-in is now mandatory, hated giving my details to random 3rd party providers. Sometimes the QR code doesn't work. Not sure if it's a camera issue, the code or the app but two phones from seperate manufacturers couldn't get it to work.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 10:36:35__

> Overall the app is doing some things well. 1. The blue Photo ID cards issued by service NSW should be able to be stored in addition to licences. 2. The 'sign into a venue' is stupidly hidden under the 3 dots. It needs to be more accessible and obvious than that. 3. There needs to be an accessible trail of log ins to covid safe venues which also allows you to choose which one you are signing out of and when. 4. There needs to be an off-line version of the digital licence (and photo ID card).<br> :date: __2021-01-18 09:04:54__

> Got the covid app to work our fault not having mobile data turned on.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 06:30:37__

</p>

> Pretty good<br> :date: __2021-01-18 23:04:43__

> Ok......but there should be a button for people with you without phones. That are not dependants!!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 23:01:26__

> Difficult where limited connectivity. Would be much more usable if you could save dependants, rather than having to type them in every single time.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 03:24:32__

> On Android, when attempting to enter the PIN, the text 'Forgot PIN' cannot be selected if font size is large. Have to change font size, login with email, set PIN, logout, reset font, then login with new PIN.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 22:28:06__

> Okay on my work phone but please make a version for older 32bit phones so I can use it on my own phone. What is so amazing about this app that it needs 64bit anyway?<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:01:27__

> I think everything is more complicated than it really needs to be<br> :date: __2021-01-14 01:25:53__

> Re COVID: no idea if it works or not. How do ordinary people tell??<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:06:29__

> App is fine for rego, licence etc but does not work for covid sign ins. Apparently a common problem for most. If you have this problem, uninstall the app and use the webform, it works the majority of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-12 21:55:35__

> Checking in/out of a location is ok. Suggestions: - Last checked in place was front an centre when you re-enter the app so you can click to check out. Time consuming and difficult to find the last check-in when you are in a rush. - Pre-set dependants during the checking in process. Very annoying to have to "add dependant" over and over again esp when you have kids with you. - Check in location/time/date history. To be able to go back and see if you have been in hotspot locations.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 11:12:37__

> Shocking experience trying to scan into most places. The thing keeps coming up saying there's an error. I'd expect that if the govt have made their qr code mandatory then it would work!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:33:09__

> Went out of town and tried signing in to places through their covid check in. Unfortunately, wherever I tried, it told me I was at one of the places I visited from my home town. Every. Time.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 23:22:43__

> There is a major issue with the COVID check-in feature for this app. When I scan a code at one venue, it automatically tries to check me in to the previous venue that I checked into, even if that was a few days ago. There is no screen telling you the venue the app assumes you're at until you actually check in. If I notice this has happened I immediatlely check out and scan again - but it's easy for this to slip past, particularly for venues which have unusual names such as a company name that does not match the business. If this problem occurs for others, it's likely that this app is registering thousands of incorrect checkins for people which will substantially impact contact tracing.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 22:54:04__

> How can I get it to work . Everything downloaded but will never scan .no one can tell me why<br> :date: __2021-01-18 07:36:37__

> How can I BBC uninstall the app as it hasn't downloaded properly. The app icon has not downloaded and I cannot access the Covid QR app<br> :date: __2021-01-17 23:25:11__

> Why do we have to sign in with the app and sign in with our club that is twice👎<br> :date: __2021-01-17 06:11:15__

> Covid check-in function keeps showing previous checked in venue rather than the current one at scan.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 02:14:35__

> Will not check in covid register<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:55:49__

> Pop-ups too small to read.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 00:47:09__

> Still has a bug with covid checkin. 3 times this week it has checked me in to my last check in place when I scan somewhere new. Not very accurate as a result.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:50:30__

> Rubbish. I already have a MyServiceNSW account, and it won't allow me to log in, but keeps coming up with a "check your connection" , but my connection is working to uninstall and reinstall the app several times to try and fix it. Should allow me to give rating of Zero. All permissions are enabled (camera & SD card access)<br> :date: __2021-01-23 04:35:23__

> Been trying to link my driver's licence for 8 months and every time the system is ''temporarily'' unavailable. The contact us button is a broken link and other methods of linking just lead to waiting for 3mins then a crash page.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 10:05:24__

> There's no point of having an app if it just sends you to a Web browser - and forces you to log in all over again. Epic fail. New: Covid-safe checkin: "Cannot check in at this time" 🙄<br> :date: __2021-01-22 08:46:05__

> Difficult to use<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:00:09__

> I spend a collective THREE HOURS on the phone only to find out that nothing on this app works for me because I have a Huawei phone. 😤<br> :date: __2021-01-21 10:16:33__

> It never scans!<br> :date: __2021-01-21 08:06:43__

> Very hard to sign up. ACT check in app much easier and less frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 06:23:14__

> Now they add qr code. Still Inaccessible. Allows drivers licence scan, but not photo id or any disability related info. In other words it neglects us. Typical nsw govt attitude. QR codes are not accessible to people with vision loss . No alternative. Typical nsw govt. Also you Put fishing licences above anyone with photo id. Poor priorities there. Both are easy to set up but you ignore disabled people. Your IT people should have a long hard think. Equity must be addressed. NOT changing my review because you haven't fixed it yet despite repeated promises. Remember that the law applies to you too. Not just google reviews. You must make this stuff accessible,<br> :date: __2021-01-21 04:18:05__
