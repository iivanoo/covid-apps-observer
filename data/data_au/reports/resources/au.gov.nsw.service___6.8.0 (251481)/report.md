## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

It is good for my licence, but when I want to log in to a Covid Safe site it locks up. I don't want to be too critical of someone's effort it providing the information it does provide. Buy really! It does seem to have some serious limitations.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 06:49:43__

> Edited: Yes, changing the time to automatic network settings worked. Odd but there you go. Cheers! ❓❓❓❓❓ Frustrating! Keeps saying password incorrect (I can login on the website with it, I even changed it just in case, no go), keeps glitching, does not update properly...

Whats the point of pushing people to use the app when it does not work? Makes me wonder if this is the quality of the programming being applied to protect our personal information.
