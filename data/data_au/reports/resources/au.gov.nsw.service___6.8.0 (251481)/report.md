## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It works great then after a month it won't focus on code, I have uninstall the install to get it to work again??<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:43:49__

> Functional improvements needed * login: takes a lot longer than it should because keypad doesn't immediately pop up. Makes people in lines impatient, and I bet some people don't checkin because of this hassle * Manual edits for check-in Covid Safe function: occasionally I need to update my checkin/out times but I can't seem to. This would give more accuracy to Health contact tracers.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 04:08:27__

> Can't login with my correct credentials recently, including fingerprint. I can login to the Service NSW website though. Clearly the app is broken at the moment. Reinstall did not fix. EDIT: Make sure your time and date is set to automatic on your phone or the login won't work even if the time is correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:37:03__

> This app is so glitchy and a pain to use.when it works its great, but if it decides not to work - wrong pin; something went wrong try again later ..... Shortcomings and glitching need to be fixed when this app is required to login before entering anywhere these days.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 10:43:45__

> Doesn't accept my valid email. Doesn't work with recovery ph number. Uninstalled due to above issues. But will just rely on my phones inbuilt QR scanner. Less stress, and it actually works better and as intended. If apps don't work properly they automatically get 1 out of 5 stars. Edit: oh and got a suspicious txt which had a mobile number which doesn't match any official numbers any .gov uses. Yeah nah. Pass.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 17:15:24__

> On library advice for covid safe, tried setup new account, discov already had account. Attempts to login slowed by p/w issues. Finally accessed, but got error saying "details mismatch". Accepted req to get emailed ident code. Code didnt arrive after 2 tries, then threatened with lockout. Half hour time wasted, still have to sort out over phone. Wont be using app to use library. Stress & wasted time - for what?<br> :date: __2021-05-12 23:27:12__

> How dare you delete my review ! it's the truth it is useless! and a waste of time . and how dare you not get back to me! I did not swear in my review you deleted im telling the public your app is pathetic useless! I can't log in with correct password I created new one and still not get in! service nsw in store couldn't help me ! your app is worth 0 stars and I'm telling you not asking you don't delete this review im disgusted! unacceptable! #CENCERSHIP!!!😡<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:12:01__

> I changed email address for my services ap to new email and updated all details but since then my pin to log into services ap will not work. I am asked to change my pin, by logging in which I can do. I change the pin get message that says it has successfully changed my pin but then when I log out and try to log in with pin it does not work. I have tried clearing ap cache, clearing ap data, restarting my phone, changing time setting and constantly get message that my new pin is incorrect. Help<br> :date: __2021-05-10 07:10:53__

> Edited: Yes, changing the time to automatic network settings worked. Odd but there you go. Cheers! ❓❓❓❓❓ Frustrating!

Driving me batty! 🤯🤯🤯<br> :date: __2021-05-08 08:28:48__

> Recent update has broken everything. My license is no longer visible and I can't re-link it to my account. I enter me email and after a minute it says "Something went wrong". Whats the point of pushing people to use the app when it does not work? Makes me wonder if this is the quality of the programming being applied to protect our personal information.
