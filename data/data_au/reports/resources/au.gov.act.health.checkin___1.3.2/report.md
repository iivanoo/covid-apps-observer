## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Cool app! I prefer this much more than writing my name down with a pen 50 other people have used that day. Great to see more places in Canberra are using it too.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:50:38__

> Red es DVR DVR you vf you have any other information you can get the best regards<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:24:49__

> Used it a few times at the library, worked quickly, easily, and without issue. Wish more places would use this.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 07:32:34__

> Now that you remember frequent guests (eg, my husband) it takes under 5 seconds to check in. Great job.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 02:09:59__

> Good job Canberra! This is more in line with the privacy requirements than signing a sheet of paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 02:40:40__

> Works really well, much better than using a google form<br> :date: __2020-10-06 11:10:27__

> Easy to use but don't just scan QR and expect app to open. The QR does nothing but open a website, thats what they mostly do. Scanning a QR will just take you to website to download. It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> Quick and easy to use, really good!<br> :date: __2020-09-27 10:53:21__

> Much quicker and easier to use than scanning a QR code to click to load a website and manually entering your details. Better security is a plus too, it'd be hard to tell if random QR code is linking to a legit website or not.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 06:20:23__

> Good!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 08:06:04__

> Its missing a checkout button to end ur visit to a place. It needs a time out to ensure correct contact tracing<br> :date: __2020-12-09 02:30:00__

> First try today - so very relieved to have no issues at Restaurant. Guess there's no need to checkout on departure?<br> :date: __2020-12-04 03:55:33__

> Not enough businesses on it. Many still using pen and paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:00:51__

> Samsung GS7 will not scan QR code. App has camera permission enabled. Phone will scan QR codes, but not in this app. Fixed! Thanks! App now returns "Not a check in CBR code" on invalid QR scans<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:18:26__

> Takes ages to open the camera scanner function.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 09:13:41__

> Seems to work ok. Slow to load, requiring data connection to do so. Cannot access QR code scanner without data connection. Suggest allowing access to QR code scanner without needing data connection to allow check in, uploading locations when data becomes available.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:58:59__

> Would be better if you could check in by typing name of check-in place, geolocation, or select from previous check-in history.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 01:20:33__

> Works for some places, not others, it just says enter manually code<br> :date: __2020-10-08 23:36:53__

> The App has not changed to daylight savings.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:02:09__

> It won't work never get number<br> :date: __2020-12-05 07:21:05__

> Didn't recognise QR codes at a pub and at the Australian National Museum. Strange as other QR code reader redirected me to this Canberra Check in app anyway. Android / Oppo<br> :date: __2020-11-25 22:13:55__

> Won't install!! Running a Samsung Note 10 so shouldn't be a compatibility issue!!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 04:53:26__

> Complete failure. Says enter code but no indication of where to get code.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 00:06:22__

> This app does not work. I've tried at 3 different locations and it has not worked once. Scanning a QR code and entering details manually was far easier. So now have to use written sign in if available or not bother signing in (playgrounds)<br> :date: __2020-10-27 04:01:35__

> Poorly implemented solution. Clunky / inconvenient to use. Uninstalled it immediately after using it for the first time.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 07:41:15__

> Have tried to scan a couple of times and it hasn't worked. Uninstalled and reinstalled. See how it works then.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 12:14:32__

> Doesn't even download<br> :date: __2020-10-07 11:17:45__

> Didn't download while I was at the venue. Now I don't have the QR code so cannot check in. What's wrong with QR link to a webpage? That works well. This app just adds failure.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 12:33:53__

> Poor. Three venues in a row where the QR code isn't recognised.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:04:22__
