In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app works well. Should be used all across Australia.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 23:29:37__

> Cool app! I prefer this much more than writing my name down with a pen 50 other people have used that day. Great to see more places in Canberra are using it too.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:50:38__

> Red es DVR DVR you vf you have any other information you can get the best regards<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:24:49__

> Used it a few times at the library, worked quickly, easily, and without issue. Wish more places would use this.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 07:32:34__

> Now that you remember frequent guests (eg, my husband) it takes under 5 seconds to check in. Great job.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 02:09:59__

> Good job Canberra! This is more in line with the privacy requirements than signing a sheet of paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 02:40:40__

> Works really well, much better than using a google form<br> :date: __2020-10-06 11:10:27__

> Easy to use but don't just scan QR and expect app to open. The QR does nothing but open a website, thats what they mostly do. Scanning a QR will just take you to website to download. It will not open app. Once I downloaded app and added my details, I clicked check in and then I scanned the QR (after giving app permission) Easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:41:02__

> Quick and easy to use, really good!<br> :date: __2020-09-27 10:53:21__

> Much quicker and easier to use than scanning a QR code to click to load a website and manually entering your details. Better security is a plus too, it'd be hard to tell if random QR code is linking to a legit website or not.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 06:20:23__

> App makes check-in easy and I like how it remembers dependents for easy future check-ins. Would be nice if locations you frequented could be remembered and used in the same way for easy repeat check-ins without needing a code or to huddle around a QR code that someone had posted on the wall.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 07:37:19__

> Its missing a checkout button to end ur visit to a place. It needs a time out to ensure correct contact tracing<br> :date: __2020-12-09 02:30:00__

> First try today - so very relieved to have no issues at Restaurant. Guess there's no need to checkout on departure?<br> :date: __2020-12-04 03:55:33__

> Not enough businesses on it. Many still using pen and paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:00:51__

> Samsung GS7 will not scan QR code. App has camera permission enabled. Phone will scan QR codes, but not in this app. Fixed! Thanks! App now returns "Not a check in CBR code" on invalid QR scans<br> :date: __2020-10-02 04:18:26__



#### 3-star reviews

> Takes ages to open the camera scanner function.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 09:13:41__

> Seems to work ok. Slow to load, requiring data connection to do so. Cannot access QR code scanner without data connection. Suggest allowing access to QR code scanner without needing data connection to allow check in, uploading locations when data becomes available.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:58:59__

> Would be better if you could check in by typing name of check-in place, geolocation, or select from previous check-in history.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 01:20:33__

> Works for some places, not others, it just says enter manually code<br> :date: __2020-10-08 23:36:53__

> The App has not changed to daylight savings.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:02:09__

> Takes to long to download<br> :date: __2020-12-06 04:07:36__

> Not easy to use how in the world do you check out<br> :date: __2021-01-29 07:25:04__

> In a word "FRUSTRATING" one minute it works. The next nothing. Tried reinstall and it just sits there "pending " for the last hour and nothing. NOT USER FRIENDLY typical geek app and NO support.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 05:10:49__

> Great idea. Could open app but nothing else, no registration, no login, app unresponsive. Sad face.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:47:25__

> I have been trying now for 2 days (at different times) to download this app without success ...dont know what else I can do ...it doesn't work as easy as others so looks like a manual check in is the only option ...not good !!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:52:54__

> Total waste, every other state uses an internet portal rather than wasting money on a useless app<br> :date: __2021-01-08 03:03:58__

> Went to check in after visiting a store at 10.50am. Scanned went to download app....10 mins later still waiting to download app. Is there an online option. Edit: it took over 4 hours to download. Before suggesting my settings are at fault, I had no problem updating or downloading other apps, just this one<br> :date: __2021-01-04 21:25:00__

> Three times tried to create an account, but it doesn't go beyond the registration page and the Privacy Notice. Must be a glitch in the app. Pls sort it out.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 00:29:29__

> Doesn't work. Tried reinstalling twice and still returns error message about no registered business location at every shop I've tried. Worked for others but not me. Manual also doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 03:21:51__

> I was forced to get this app that collects information on you for the gov. F'ing Nanny State.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 00:53:00__
