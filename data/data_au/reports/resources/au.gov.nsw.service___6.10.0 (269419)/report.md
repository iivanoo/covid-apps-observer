## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very annoying that every time I want to use the covid check-in I have to keep adding the info for the same dependent every time. Why can't we have the option to add a dependent from a saved list.<br> :date: __2021-05-19 04:22:12__

> Hi Service NSW Development Team, Will be great if you can add the login details inside the app, so we can view our email and mobile number that we use. Thanks!<br> :date: __2021-05-16 16:06:32__

> It works great then after a month it won't focus on code, I have uninstall the install to get it to work again??<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:43:49__

> Functional improvements needed * login: takes a lot longer than it should because keypad doesn't immediately pop up. Makes people in lines impatient, and I bet some people don't checkin because of this hassle * Manual edits for check-in Covid Safe function: occasionally I need to update my checkin/out times but I can't seem to. This would give more accuracy to Health contact tracers.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 04:08:27__

> Generally ok, constant issues with covid-19 check-ins as well as inconvenient de-linking of my driver's license.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 06:14:23__

> Have had some difficulty particularly singing out.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 03:04:07__

> Can't login with my correct credentials recently, including fingerprint. I can login to the Service NSW website though. Clearly the app is broken at the moment. Reinstall did not fix. EDIT: Make sure your time and date is set to automatic on your phone or the login won't work even if the time is correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:37:03__

> The app has generally been good to use, however it is slow to recognise a fingerprint or pin & it also has an abnormally high battery usage, draining around 17% each day after just a check-in or two.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 13:47:35__
