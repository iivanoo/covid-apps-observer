## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Directions easy to follow<br> :date: __2021-05-26 03:15:41__

> Great app all over, very useful. However I don't get notifications to remind me to check out of a venue unless I go back into the app itself first, which defeats the purpose. Also, I've noticed many places have difficulty scanning the Dine & Discover vouchers when the app is set to dark mode. Easily fixed by switching back to light, but worth mentioning for possible fixes.<br> :date: __2021-05-23 12:50:50__

> Easy way to carry your licence credentials, however getting them can be a little difficult.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 22:08:17__

> The information on page is half covered over and hard to read top part can not be read<br> :date: __2021-05-24 05:06:35__

> Hi Service NSW Development Team, Will be great if you can add the login details inside the app, so we can view our email and mobile number that we use. Thanks!<br> :date: __2021-05-16 16:06:32__

> It works great then after a month it won't focus on code, I have uninstall the install to get it to work again??<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:43:49__

> Functional improvements needed * login: takes a lot longer than it should because keypad doesn't immediately pop up. Makes people in lines impatient, and I bet some people don't checkin because of this hassle * Manual edits for check-in Covid Safe function: occasionally I need to update my checkin/out times but I can't seem to. This would give more accuracy to Health contact tracers.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 04:08:27__

> Generally ok, constant issues with covid-19 check-ins as well as inconvenient de-linking of my driver's license.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 06:14:23__

> Gr8 app for checkin when rego due ,demerits an vouchers available etc an digital license if u forget ya wallet<br> :date: __2021-05-07 03:35:16__

> Very difficult to complete<br> :date: __2021-05-03 06:36:20__

> Have had some difficulty particularly singing out.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 03:04:07__

> Can't login with my correct credentials recently, including fingerprint. I can login to the Service NSW website though. Clearly the app is broken at the moment. Reinstall did not fix. EDIT: Make sure your time and date is set to automatic on your phone or the login won't work even if the time is correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:37:03__

> The app has generally been good to use, however it is slow to recognise a fingerprint or pin & it also has an abnormally high battery usage, draining around 17% each day after just a check-in or two.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 13:47:35__

> works brilliantly... except now for some dumb reason it makes me enter my PIN in every time. when 99.9% of the time I just want to make a check in, what's the point in protecting the whole app with a PIN? it's been amazingly user-friendly thus far in covid times, let's hope that continues<br> :date: __2021-05-30 03:13:33__

> I have had the app running for about a year or so with no complaints. Today I have been booted off the app for no standard softwear. What ever that means. Don't look like I'll be using it again. Completely blocked even online and my email addresses does not exist anymore.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 01:01:50__

> Doesn't recognise password. I just tried using this on Samsung S21 and reset my password 3 times. It works on the Web browser. Looks like I won't be able to go anywhere as most places require a check in using this app. Please fix!!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 09:24:16__

> Can't sign in, login details correct on web app. Terrible mobile app development.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 05:24:46__

> how can i install this app on my microsoft surface pro?<br> :date: __2021-05-29 03:55:59__

> Wont work keeps asking for add name and address but wont accept anything<br> :date: __2021-05-28 07:53:50__

> Trying to reset password, doesn't seem to work ! Sends you to a website then app doesn't recognise new one. Rubbish and slow<br> :date: __2021-05-28 07:26:10__

> Continuously tries to check you back into the last place you visited again when opening, instead of allowing you to check into somewhere new or check out of the place you left<br> :date: __2021-05-27 12:33:55__

> Has decided to declare my device is running non-standard software so I can no longer log in. Beyond the fact that I am running standard android on a pixel device, which is about as standard software as you can get, to arbitrarily lock me out of using the app is ridiculous. I used to be a big fan of this app but if a bug or policy change declaring pixels are no longer standard can do this then I really can't recommend it anymore and will advise people stay away to avoid being caught out like me.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 04:05:14__
