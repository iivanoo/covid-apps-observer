## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Can't login with my correct credentials recently, including fingerprint. I can login to the Service NSW website though. Clearly the app is broken at the moment. Reinstall did not fix. EDIT: Make sure your time and date is set to automatic on your phone or the login won't work even if the time is correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:37:03__

> Nothing to tell<br> :date: __2021-04-27 22:18:21__

> To many loops that bring you back to the same place. Extremely difficult to make contact without interogation<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:31:30__

> Slow to update<br> :date: __2021-04-15 01:25:49__

> Only giving it 3 because how long is the photo id for proof of age<br> :date: __2021-04-14 14:10:31__

> If this is the Services NSW app, why can't I read the current value of my senior's travel card or see my Dine and Discover details? Where is my Opel card? It is good for my licence, but when I want to log in to a Covid Safe site it locks up. I don't want to be too critical of someone's effort it providing the information it does provide. Buy really! It does seem to have some serious limitations.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 06:49:43__

> I always get the woman who has a attitude problem. Its Saturday, so why am I here. Bad customer service from Grafton office.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 04:12:12__

> My digital drivers licence will no longer load (appear) in this app. Been an issue for weeks now. How can I rectify. Settings appear all correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 04:07:14__

> Issues with checking in to places. Wherever is the first place in the day that I check in for, it will continually keep checking me in to the same place despite me scanning a different QR Code. And before you ask, yes I have the most up-to-date version and yes I have un-installed and then re-installed many times. What's the point if you can't even develop the app to work properly.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 12:18:31__

> This app is so glitchy and a pain to use.when it works its great, but if it decides not to work - wrong pin; something went wrong try again later .....

> Thank you for your response, but what I meant was all the categories are visible, only the bottom half of each category label is visible, they have no top. Why would the app only work properly on a mobile and not a tablet? Android and iOS both operate on mobile phones and tablets. Some tablets can make phone calls. The feedback section does not work on either phone or tablet. Also, it would be nice if the screen could be rotated.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 06:11:01__

> I felt the person I was talking to was not friendly and after waiting for 40 minutes the person hung up on me. Very poor service.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 02:03:00__
