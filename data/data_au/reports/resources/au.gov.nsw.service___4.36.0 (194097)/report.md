## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app. Noissues<br> :date: __2021-02-06 01:42:06__

> Fantastic, easy to use, great idea having covid sign in and digital license , fantstic !well done !<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:29:53__

> Qick and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-02-04 04:33:54__

> The QR Code check in and out feature works fine when its correct use is explained. I personally would prefer that it be intuitive and remember, and show, the last check in when you choose that feature.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 02:59:21__

> Great app to have. Saves you carrying your driver's licence and makes it so easy to check in<br> :date: __2021-02-04 02:45:59__

> When checking in with covid safe repeatedly instructed to try again later???<br> :date: __2021-02-06 05:47:19__

> It's a great app slot better than the Canberra check-in app<br> :date: __2021-02-05 19:16:05__

> Good most of the time, except when it signs itself out. Also hard to work in council library.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 06:27:42__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-02-04 03:09:15__

> I could give 5/5 stars if I could press and hold the COVID icon to move it to the top of the screen so I wouldn't have to scroll down everytime I have to use this most frequenty used app.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 09:30:37__

> Good, but should be combined with another so automatically generated in and out time, wasted too long to scan especially when phone get hit up.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 18:44:09__

> Pretty easy to work out. Wish the covid check in was higher on the toolbar.. app seems to be using a lot of battery life. On my Samsung s9.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 09:59:46__

> Overall not too bad, but given the number one use these days wiuld be covid checkin, surely this should be the easiest thing to access. Ability to customise a home screen like many other apps might be useful - or even a setting for users to define a default button to auto open. As a minimum it should be the top option on the existing layout.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 22:32:42__

> VERY EASY TO USE<br> :date: __2021-01-28 11:22:19__

> Pretty good. Once I'd set it up with my details on first use it's relatively painless. Just wish I could opt not to show "add dependent" cos I'm not gonna be having anyone with me that can't check in by themselves and it's irritating to have to remember to scroll past that to tap Check In.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 09:26:25__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Cooks my s10e<br> :date: __2021-02-06 02:41:31__

> It would be good if you could put the app into "COVID mode" where as soon as it loads and you enter your PIN it's onto the QR code scanning screen instead of having to navigate to the scan QR code screen.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 12:02:26__

> Good, however low stars because some licences not included including Shooters Licence. What's the point if its not complete?<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:47:39__

> Would have given it a higher rating but does not have support for Duck Duck Go browser for payments. Not all of us want to be spied on by big tech<br> :date: __2021-02-03 02:20:11__

> I agree with previous reviews. Should have the ability to say what function is immediate (covid in my case). Also the check out function is a dog's breakfast. Other covid apps, there's the checkout button when opening phone. This one it's PIN (why not offer checkout instead or first), navigate, no I don't want scan I want to checkout. Could I confirm that? Oh, I did all that navigating by mistake? Takes 8 keystrokes/navigates when one should do. What's the stat's on people checking out - 1%?<br> :date: __2021-02-01 01:34:06__

> Digital licence and other services work well. The Covid check in and out process should be smooth but on my phone it keeps checking into places I have been to weeks before rather than the venue I am checking into. It is so frustrating<br> :date: __2021-01-31 03:40:02__

> Only got this because the service NSW QR code became compulsory for all venues. Will sometimes check me in to a venue I was at 3 days ago when I scan the QR code for a very different venue. And I cannot manually change the venue<br> :date: __2021-01-30 20:55:35__

> Pretty good<br> :date: __2021-01-18 23:04:43__

> Ok......but there should be a button for people with you without phones. That are not dependants!!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 23:01:26__

> Difficult where limited connectivity. Would be much more usable if you could save dependants, rather than having to type them in every single time.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 03:24:32__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

> Logged me out. The app keeps saying incorrect password yet logging in online it works. It's since the app has started using qr for covid logins. When I press forgot password it's not sending anything to my email to fix it. Very frustrating<br> :date: __2021-02-05 04:36:48__

> When I use my camera to scan the covid check in QR code and check in without first opening the app, it keeps re-checking me into the last place I was at and not the current place. Once this occurs I can't undo the incorrect check in. This is a major problem in how the app is operating for the last few weeks and will produce incorrect data for contact tracers so is quite concerning.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 21:12:32__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-01-28 23:00:25__

> Shocking experience trying to scan into most places. The thing keeps coming up saying there's an error. I'd expect that if the govt have made their qr code mandatory then it would work!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-22 05:33:09__

> Went out of town and tried signing in to places through their covid check in. Unfortunately, wherever I tried, it told me I was at one of the places I visited from my home town. Every. Time.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 23:22:43__

> There is a major issue with the COVID check-in feature for this app. When I scan a code at one venue, it automatically tries to check me in to the previous venue that I checked into, even if that was a few days ago. There is no screen telling you the venue the app assumes you're at until you actually check in. If I notice this has happened I immediatlely check out and scan again - but it's easy for this to slip past, particularly for venues which have unusual names such as a company name that does not match the business. If this problem occurs for others, it's likely that this app is registering thousands of incorrect checkins for people which will substantially impact contact tracing.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 22:54:04__

> How can I get it to work . Everything downloaded but will never scan .no one can tell me why<br> :date: __2021-01-18 07:36:37__

> How can I BBC uninstall the app as it hasn't downloaded properly. The app icon has not downloaded and I cannot access the Covid QR app<br> :date: __2021-01-17 23:25:11__

> Why do we have to sign in with the app and sign in with our club that is twice👎<br> :date: __2021-01-17 06:11:15__

> Covid check-in function keeps showing previous checked in venue rather than the current one at scan.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 02:14:35__

> Can't login to the app but can online? Reset my password 4 tims thinking it was me but confirmed new password online but app it won't recognise! Waste of time really.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 13:33:42__

> The app jams my phone, messaging. mucks up my keyboard, and my phone won't charge properly. After I uninstall app my phone works without any hitches. Conceot of the app is good, but functionality is bad.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 03:41:40__

> Will not register me<br> :date: __2021-02-05 02:28:48__

> Latest update does not work with Android 11. QR log in no longer works - useless<br> :date: __2021-02-04 21:43:31__

> This app is disgraceful. Absolutely frustrating I downloaded it and worked fine the first time I used it now it won't allow me to sign in saying please enter a valid email address ffs it's the same email i first logged in with and the only email I've ever had. You try and do the right thing and have to deal with this absolute rubbish. How the hell are the elderly expected to use the app?<br> :date: __2021-02-04 11:56:06__

> It doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-02-04 09:24:24__

> Can't login to app. Everytime I type in my correct login details, an error message keeps popping up saying "It looks like your device may be using non-standard software". It use to work fine but then one day it stopped working. I have tried certifying my device via Google but still won't certify. I need to use the app when I check into places.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 08:22:03__

> Cannot sign up. Scan code, add details. App sends a text code. Go to split screen to copy the code. Return to the app and all my details are wiped. Rubbish.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 04:25:55__

> Forced control<br> :date: __2021-02-02 02:40:18__

> Ever since I updated the app on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I can no longer log on. It constantly informs me that my phone is not supported and will not log me in Terrible app.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 11:03:56__
