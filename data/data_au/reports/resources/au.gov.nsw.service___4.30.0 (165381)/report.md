## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> older people (in our seventies) have a problem 1 finding the NSW services APP. as going to the store to download it there is so many scanners to pick from. 2 we ended installing the incorrect scanner. 3 when we did locate the scanner, it said that it has been installed, 4 we have checked the phone we couldn't locate the scanner anywhere. when we go to have lunch etc the young staff are amazed, that we can't install it, This is very embarressing in front of others waiting. can you help us?

> My wife has tried to download the NSW Service App to comply with Covid 19 check-in ans check-out new rules. Her mobile phone is a Samsung S5, not too old bit certainly not the latest mobile phone on the market. Download failed after attempting many times. After some research I have found that Mobiles need to be operation on Android 6. My wife's phone operates on Android 4.4.4 and cannot be updated, this confirmed by speaking to a Samsung help line earlier today. We are both in out late 60's and are not prepared to buy new phones. What can be done?<br> :date: __2020-11-22 07:39:19__

> Could you please create a widget that takes the user straight to the Service NSW QR code scanner? Having to open the app, then go to the Covid-Safe check in button slows things down when queuing in a store or restaurant. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-11-29 05:05:52__

> Went to the pub for a beer yesterday and it wouldn't work with QR code. P my Had to sign in manually. It is not clear if the app has worked.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 05:14:12__

> I have been using digital license since it is available. It has worked for couple of emergency situation but it cannot replace the card completely. For an example- when we use license for identity purposes, some websites ask for the number on the back of the card which is not available in digital version!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-24 08:19:27__

> I thought Service NSW was offering a QR reader download. I can find lots of support for businesses, but do you offer a QR reader for citizens like me?? If so, how do I find it?<br> :date: __2020-11-23 04:42:31__

> State government is encouraging residents to use the Services NSW app to scan in, but the QR reader doesn't work anywhere, and I mean anywhere. How ridiculous not to have a integrated system. Clearly lacked end user experience testing.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 07:35:37__

> All good except the driver license page freezes and the app becomes unresponsive on my phone<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:47:16__

> App freezes on my pixel 3a at license display. Can't check in to a venue or prove the license isn't a screenshot as app freezes there every single time even after a reinstall.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:27:03__
