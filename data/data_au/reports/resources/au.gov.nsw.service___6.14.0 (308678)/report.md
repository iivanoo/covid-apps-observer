## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |
| **Email** | mobileapp@service.nsw.gov.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's really good to have this app on your smartphone or PC but one thing to be improve is, scanning of number plate doesn't function well and can't get the job done. Please fix this as I need this function every day. Thanks for servicing NSW<br> :date: __2021-07-23 16:19:31__

> Good app with the best of intentions. 5 stars if an option to turn off the authentication screen could be added. Annoying that I have to unlock my phone, then unlock the app before I can Check In/Check Out. The double-authentication is quite redundant considering other "sensitive" apps like PayPal, MyTelstra etc simply retain your credentials between phone restarts. 22/07/21 EDIT: Bug with "nested" check-ins? I checked in at the entrance to a shopping mall, then checked in/out of the various shops I visited. When leaving the mall I couldn't do a final check-out. The Check-in history shows "(check out pending)" with no way to access it.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 05:41:39__

> Just a minor problem which might not be able to fix On Sunday I tried to check out of a business and it didn't work and needed to check in to the next shop Later that day I was checked into the 1st business again even though I had not scanned in for checking in and I was about 4 km from there and had checked into another shop for essentials I noticed yesterday that it tried to do this again to me but was able to quickly get out of the app Is there a way to delete this check in<br> :date: __2021-07-22 03:41:29__

> happy with the app QR great although I keep forgetting to logout<br> :date: __2021-07-19 07:38:09__

> As a retailer, we don't know if people are signing in or not, the app should have a ding sound that can be heard to indicate it's been signed in etc please<br> :date: __2021-07-19 05:16:43__

> Very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-18 14:40:31__

> If you go to a shopping centre and scan in at the front door, and then scan in when you go in a store it will let you scan out for the store, but will not let you scan out when you leave the shopping centre. As you can't get back to the first scanned in. And says scan out pending in history.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 08:32:11__

> Can't check out of 2 places, say u go into a shopping centre, check in and go to another shop inside that shopping centre check in u can check out of that shop u just came out but can't check out of the shopping centre when u leave and sometimes when I check in to another place it comes up the last place I checked in and I have to go back to the check in screen and do it again the qld check in app has a way faster check in system open, scan, check in now done no check out b.s<br> :date: __2021-07-23 14:13:52__

> Takes too many clicks to check in. I've signed out so that I don't need to authenticate every time I check in, but now I don't have check-in history. Can't the authentication be only for parts of the app that need it like the driver's license?<br> :date: __2021-07-23 06:47:23__

> Mostassistingthank ton Thoughts k<br> :date: __2021-07-21 09:00:21__

> Would be great if COVID check-in had offline functionality. Reception is horrible in some shopping centers and check-ins are being skipped when customers can't sign into the app. Fingerprint Auth dialog is very buggy. Sometimes leaving a blank white box after successful scan.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 00:29:14__

> Why do I have to enter a pin number everytime I open this app it just slows things down.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 11:00:44__

> Please add the ability for an employee to check-in at the start of their day/shift, and then check-out at the end, instead of constantly being reminded to check out when they know they'll still be there for hours and hours.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 05:32:16__

> Hi Team,I c other people with the same issue ,I'll wait for the fix, there is a problem with the Check in and out, I checked in to the shopping centre and then Woolies but when I checked out from Woolies it cleared the shopping centre and now in the history it says that I haven't checked out from the centre and no way to check out.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 03:48:34__

> Can't add my digital license?!!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 12:57:25__

> As others have mentioned, need to improve the check out function. So many pending check outs which can't be done due to being over ridden by another check in within the complex (i.e shopping centre then store within shopping centre). Being able to check out 2 most recent check ins would be a huge improvement.<br> :date: __2021-07-18 21:25:57__

> You cant check out of a venue if you jave alreay checked in somewhere else. You need to allow users to check out venues listed in the history<br> :date: __2021-07-18 15:18:53__

> It's not scanning at all it only worked three times since I installed it.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 21:21:04__

> There is something wrong with the app, it keeps checking me into a place I went to weeks ago every time I open the app to scan a new QR code.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 01:32:27__

> Have trouble logging into the app. Biometrics feature fails and pin says incorrect everytime. Pin needs to be reset everytime to log into the app<br> :date: __2021-07-21 01:11:18__

> An absolute embarrassment that this app is supposed to keep us safe. Just another example of politicians giving import jobs to mates rather than competent people.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 10:04:31__

> Most of the time it works OK but it has some serious bugs. 1, there has been many times I've checked in, then when I get back to the app to check out, it's not there. As if I never checked in! And yes I did get the Green Tick. 2, There is an instance I can't check out believe it or not! Checked into 2 placrs & can't check out of one of them! Still pending from 9+ hours ago that I left & I can't do anything. 3, There is an instance the app completely logs out after checking in. Great :-(<br> :date: __2021-07-20 02:27:15__

> Very disappointed for the disfunctional check out system. Check in to a shopping center, check in to a shop inside of the shopping center, check out from the shop,,,,and then you can't check out from the shopping center anymore. A very common sense issue, why haven't fixed<br> :date: __2021-07-20 01:54:29__

> I lost the QR Scanner from my mobile and can't find it now. Also this app says I checked in at Bega Nov 2020?? I haven't been to Bega for abt 15 years !!!<br> :date: __2021-07-18 16:54:24__

> Can't check out of venues apart from the current one. All those pending check outs... can't someone fix this?<br> :date: __2021-07-18 07:54:45__

> Consistently being checked in to places I have already been once scanning new check in codes<br> :date: __2021-07-16 23:29:15__

> Pain in the bum having to put pin in each time, A dedicated check in and out app where i can open and scan without typing pin and hitting a button would be faster<br> :date: __2021-07-16 10:08:00__

> I have been unable to check in to certain places as it does not recognize my mobile phone number when trying to input my information. I have checked all of the information/troubleshooting websites asking for my details to confirm if there is an error but unable to get anywhere. I contacted the help line number which stated available 24/7, went through the process of what my enquiry and was and told that they are only available 7am to 7pm Mon to Fri. How am I supposed to go and do essential grocery shopping if I can not check in. I just need to confirm what mobile phone number has been recorded.
