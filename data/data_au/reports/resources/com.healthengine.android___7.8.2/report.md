### Description
> Welcome to HealthEngine, where convenience meets care.
<br>We’re here to make healthcare better by making it easier for you to find, book and manage all your healthcare online. All in one place. Anytime. 
<br>HealthEngine lets you take control of your health, allowing you to:
<br>• Find trusted GPs, dentists, physio and more across Australia
<br>• Book appointments 24/7, whenever is convenient for you
<br>• Save all your health providers in one place for faster booking next time
<br>• Find and book Telehealth appointments with online GPs and doctors
<br> 
<br>We’ve made it easier for you to see your practitioner without leaving the home, safe for you and your family.
<br> 
<br>What is Telehealth?
<br> 
<br>Telehealth is an appointment on phone or video, you’ll speak to your practitioner over secure HealthEngine video, regular phone, or by using Facetime, WhatsApp or Skype (dependent on the practice set up).
<br> 
<br>Many health issues can be solved through Telehealth and it’s a great pre-screener to touch base with your healthcare practitioner. Sometimes, the practitioner will need to see you in person and ask you to come in for a follow up appointment, or provide you with the next steps.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HealthEngine Pty Ltd |
| **Website**  | [https://healthengine.com.au/](https://healthengine.com.au/) |
| **Email** | feedback@healthengine.com.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I will need to await my next booking before I can report it as fixed. Hope. Updated & failed.. what a shame the March '21 update caused the booking appointment service to become inactive.

> This WAS good app for years. Now I can't book, keep getting 2FA codes with place to put it, uninstalled and reinstalled twice and added our profiles over and over again. Not sure what you've done in the last few months but have now got rid of it as it's easier to call the clinic.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 02:40:02__

> Useless. Said appointments weren't available on this app<br> :date: __2021-04-15 09:46:25__

> Can't login as app is stuck at verify mobile number. Clicking next does nothing<br> :date: __2021-04-08 05:33:14__

> Why do I need to get an SMS for verification? We get no mobile signal where I live and by the time I get somewhere to access the SMS, the code has expired. I've just about reached the point of ditching the app. It's s o frustrating that everyone just assumes that everyone else has mobile phone access!!<br> :date: __2021-03-29 00:04:41__

> Need to see my doctor but can't get in till ages when I call up, I get in quickly if I use the app but the update stuffed up the log in process and now I am stuck waiting. Already wrote a review and sent an email to developers but had no reply 🤨 I think if you start an important app like this you have the responsibility to make sure it works and not literally stuff peoples lives around like your doing to me.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 16:29:39__

> You should know that this company had historically been caught selling your medical data. Google it with ABC News.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 02:53:51__
