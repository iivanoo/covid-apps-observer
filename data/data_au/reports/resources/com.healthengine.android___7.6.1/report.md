### Description
> Welcome to HealthEngine, where convenience meets care.
<br>We’re here to make healthcare better by making it easier for you to find, book and manage all your healthcare online. All in one place. Anytime. 
<br>HealthEngine lets you take control of your health, allowing you to:
<br>• Find trusted GPs, dentists, physio and more across Australia
<br>• Book appointments 24/7, whenever is convenient for you
<br>• Save all your health providers in one place for faster booking next time
<br>• Find and book Telehealth appointments with online GPs and doctors
<br> 
<br>We’ve made it easier for you to see your practitioner without leaving the home, safe for you and your family.
<br> 
<br>What is Telehealth?
<br> 
<br>Telehealth is an appointment on phone or video, you’ll speak to your practitioner over secure HealthEngine video, regular phone, or by using Facetime, WhatsApp or Skype (dependent on the practice set up).
<br> 
<br>Many health issues can be solved through Telehealth and it’s a great pre-screener to touch base with your healthcare practitioner. Sometimes, the practitioner will need to see you in person and ask you to come in for a follow up appointment, or provide you with the next steps.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HealthEngine Pty Ltd |
| **Website**  | [https://healthengine.com.au/](https://healthengine.com.au/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Why after each upgrade it forgets my password? And when you try to reset the password it fails.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 23:15:54__

> Great till new update never had an issue till now doesn't show appointments anymore for any doctor can't book<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:58:09__

> Used to be ok now lets you get to adding your name / dob and won't move to next page - obviously not compatible with Samsung Tab 6/ 7 tablets, just broken or not tested properly.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 05:19:45__

> No longer can make appointments at Wantirna Mall Clinic. Have to revert back to making phone calls.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 08:23:57__

> Not all doctors are showing so limited use.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 03:36:42__

> App is ok but need to be able to check time, date and which pratictioner I am seeing. Does not show and txt msg just a reminder you have an appointment no time only a doctor. Time reminder would ui I'd be an excellent reminder.<br> :date: __2020-09-21 08:05:41__

> Why does it keep asking for Medicare card info to be input every single time I make a booking when it's already been saved in the profile? VERY annoying when I just want to make a booking quickly.<br> :date: __2020-09-06 22:41:19__

> Was an amazing and helpful app.Now it is the most useless app on the internet. Im not feeling well and its a sunday, i know my GP is popular but its ok. I have this app and can make an appointment so i dont miss out. NOPE!!!! The app doesnt allow me to make appointments on weekends anymore. So instead i cant sleep tonight out of stress. I will hsve roughly 60 sec when they start answering calls to try and gain one of 5 appointments i can see visible. If i miss out i spend days in pain.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 15:20:29__

> Stopped using this app, my mobile number changed and I cannot change it online or through the app. Can no longer access to app due to access to sms otp. I cannot access app without otp and don't use app enough to waist time calling support to update my phone number.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 07:31:34__

> Didn't appreciate my details being given to a compare the market call centre.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 13:46:16__

> Text automatically redirected me to this app, meaning while already only just in time for an appointment I had to download this on data, login to my password manager, login to this, create a passcode, and then lookup my appointment before realising the app booked me to the wrong medical center...I'm sure its a good app but why is it necessary to go through this process every time I want to do something these days? Answer: It shouldn't be, fix your $hit.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 03:07:29__

> This company was fined for onselling client information.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 09:38:30__

> Made appointments with ap that never made to doctors office my doctor has had enough of this ap and switched to a service<br> :date: __2021-03-02 23:06:57__

> Doctor very rude and Nasty. Not recommended for older people!!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-13 06:44:28__

> Will change to a better ratinh when I dont have to enter a passcode every single time I open the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 23:48:19__

> I book my aappointment online and recieved confmation email and phone with Dr rupali sharp 12:pm afternoon on Monday 04/01/2121 . When I reached i am watting for one hour . After one hour I asked the question resepetionst how much I am watting for she said no idea still three more patient watting meet to Dr rupali before you .. I am surprised and ask resepetionst what you give me time 12.00pm if appionement not avaiable. She give me no any response. really very bad services. I never goi again<br> :date: __2021-01-04 04:30:05__
