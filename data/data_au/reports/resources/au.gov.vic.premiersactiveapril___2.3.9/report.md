## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> After an initial hiccup I updated the app and it's running much smoother now. I like being able to track on the go and having the benefits card on my phone is super useful. The new workouts videos this year are a nice touch too!!<br> :date: __2019-04-04 06:36:48__

> Love this app, I use it for school and I also have a family team. I have a home gym and myself and my parents use it all the time but im assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the fitness activity selection to be cut back so I can no longer add 'gym' to my tracker, I have to put it as 'other'...Why is this???<br> :date: __2020-04-15 12:44:42__

> After Easter I was really struggling to get back into a good health and fitness routine. A friend referred me to Active April through the app and it was such an easy way to start again. There was so many freebies it was hard not to take advantage and get motivated.<br> :date: __2018-04-12 02:16:35__

> Have used in previous years with no issues. This year, I had trouble logging in at 2 stages. One was before the start of April, the other was after the middle of the month. At both times, the app refused to login, even when given the correct details (checked multiple times). It complained about an Invalid username or password. However, they were correct. I had to use the website for entering my activities for the latter half of April.<br> :date: __2020-05-01 13:23:35__

> Can you please include rowing on the list of activities? The app can be a bit slow and sometimes crashes. I like the tracker and snapshot.<br> :date: __2019-04-11 21:35:52__

> it'd have been better if it could get connected to apps such as Samsung health, Google fit, strava etc and directly imported data from there...<br> :date: __2019-04-08 16:56:41__

> Before April it was working fine, but now I try to add activity or view the fitness videos and it lags and then crashes<br> :date: __2019-04-03 10:35:43__

> Wish there was a way to link to Fitbit, or Google health<br> :date: __2019-02-23 02:10:20__

> Slow to start.  Postcode summary not working. Reports 0 hrs for my postcode<br> :date: __2018-04-07 13:23:29__

> It needs to link to Google fit and extract workouts I've completed as all the tracking apps I use log with Google fit<br> :date: __2018-04-03 03:40:26__

> Sometimes works, but for what it does, it's very slow. Clearly a web app, based on its slowness, reliance on the internet and the html error messages.<br> :date: __2019-04-24 01:41:38__

> still crashing<br> :date: __2019-04-11 11:14:37__

> App keeps crashing which is annoying as I can't log all my workouts.<br> :date: __2019-04-07 06:38:26__

> Severely lacking integration with Google Fit, Fitbit, Strava, Garmin, etc...<br> :date: __2019-03-26 23:45:44__

> Too slow to start up. What is it doing. ? Would track more time but it's tomorrow by the time the app has dtarted<br> :date: __2018-04-02 10:52:17__

> Looks good but once you try to use it, it is very slow and clunky - and my phone is moto g 3rd gen with 2GB - shouldn't have these kind of problems for this type of app for my type of phone<br> :date: __2017-04-10 14:32:10__

> Buggiest app I've got. Freezes constantly, can't click on stuff, have to constantly close and reopen.<br> :date: __2017-04-04 08:32:33__

> Very frustrating app. Lots of text looks clickable but its not. Eg the Red Activity Snapshot box. Maybe it will improve when it's live and useable. Also no Rowing option.<br> :date: __2017-03-29 14:33:34__

> What a rubbish app! And every year it's the same. Won't store my username 
and password, and then keeps telling me my password and username are 
incorrect, even though I use them successfully in the web site. Same issue 
as 2017.<br> :date: __2018-04-15 03:17:57__
