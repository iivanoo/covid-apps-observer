## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> For visitors to NSW, this app is too complicated and frustrating to use. SA and QLD apps are a breeze to use in comparison. Additional info: Tks for reply. What I found is that, despite entering my details, every time I use the QR app it wants to sms me a varification code before accepting my scanned entry. This is frustrating and holds up others wanting to enter their QR. Also I have to shuffle between sms screen and QR screen to enter the validation code. In the end I just gave up.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 06:46:46__

> The app for attendance at places out of resistance is not as it should be. This update information has stopped the app alltogether. Now it is not working at all. I am blaming you at the other end<br> :date: __2021-07-04 06:11:24__

> I've always found it useful but can no longer use it as I don't have Google and can't update it. Can you tell me how I can use the qr sign in now Update on 3 July. Can now not even sign in using the qr scanner in my phone. Doing well. It just tells me to update using Google play but won't update. July 4 iphones seem to work but androids have problems.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 03:29:17__

> Since the last update came out, I haven't been able to update this app, it has been 'pending' the whole time. Given the app won't work without the update, and we're currently in the middle of a lockdown, I would think this issue would have been fixed by now. I've read multiple other reviews from other users who also haven't been able to download the update.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 02:20:30__

> I have come to the point where the app request me to update but I can't get past this issue I have uninstalled the app and now can't get it back it's so fustrating .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 23:51:54__

> Wont update or reinstall been like it for a week now<br> :date: __2021-07-03 11:13:09__

> Couldn't update so uninstalled and can't download now.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 10:34:39__
