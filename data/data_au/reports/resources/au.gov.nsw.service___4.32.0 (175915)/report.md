## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> With Service NSW QR codes about to become mandatory, I'd like to see the following things to come up to five stars: - a widget to create a shortcut on your home screen directly to the QR check-in function - a persistent notification while you're checked in somewhere with a shortcut to check out - ability to save details of frequent companions so that you can quickly and easily check them in with you.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:40:57__

> A pain to set up but easy to use once it is going<br> :date: __2020-12-17 12:46:54__

> Issue resolved by reinstalling app :) TY! Check-in option is great feature. Would suggest adding optional location based notification for when you leave a venue so you can checkout right away. Keep up the good work folks!<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:18:45__

> Vulnerable<br> :date: __2020-12-14 23:11:56__

> There should be only one kind of QR Scan, it is too confusing and very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:56:32__

> Easy to use, but not all Riverina venues use it. What are its limitations?<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:32:42__

> Only used it once.. it worked ok, but I had to copy and paste confirmation numbers. I don't like the way that some venues don't use the dot Gov website. You have to entrust your information with strangers. If this is law that we must comply with.. venues should use the same website. The app for ACT is less intrusive.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:23:05__

> Current HTC phone with updated Android OS. This app appears to auto update, ignoring the settings to not do so on the phone. This then crashes the badly written app for managing my hearing aids and needs a 40 minute process to remove and reinstall the hearing aid app and reset the hearing aids.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 23:05:42__

> It was ok<br> :date: __2020-12-11 22:53:12__

> Problematic in use<br> :date: __2020-12-24 05:51:22__

> Licensed needs to be more accessible for quick access<br> :date: __2020-12-22 22:14:27__

> Haven't been able to get the COVID check in to work at any venues. Staff always say it never works on Samsung phones. Everything else is good that I've used in the app, but not being able to check in anywhere is annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 10:54:51__

> The App wont work on my pure android Nokia7+ because i choose to have all permissions that can be denied...denied and still have the phone operate as a phone. My phone is factory standard and hasn't had the operating system modified in any way. The fact that I don't log in to google shouldn't prevent me from accessing my details held by the government....simple two factor authentication is all that is needed for security. So now it works.....and when it works it is handy.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 02:06:53__

> Service NSW covid safe app uses NSW time but Broken Hill in FW NSW is on SA time so the times recorded are 1/2 out.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 01:15:25__

> It takes too long to open the app, wait for it to load, then eventually find the COVID check-in section, all while people are queueing behind you! Please include a long-tap shortcut that immediately opens the scanner section without all this rigmarole.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 21:54:57__

> I have uninstalled & installed again hoping it will work now Thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-18 03:12:53__

> Not working right<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:18:49__

> the old app was good and easy.but getting used to it.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:04:24__

> The covid checkin will not on Oppo A57 it is definitely service Nsw QR Code. It works fine on my Samsung Galaxy note 7. Can you update for Oppo??<br> :date: __2020-12-27 09:40:51__

> Scanned the icon successfully the other day. Since then,am asked for a pin # and doesn't accept any I input<br> :date: __2020-12-22 06:14:34__

> I have only used it to check into the RTA but it worked<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:49:50__

> Buggy - won't link my licence.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:30:38__

> Nothing works. Never recognises my email or password. Can't find my licence or where to add it<br> :date: __2020-12-20 07:20:28__

> It will not read QR codes says they are not gov codes when the are. So useless for that<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:22:46__

> Ok have tried to down load the covid app now for many weeks. It always tells me that something went wrong at their end and will not complete. IF YOU WANT US TO USE IT , FIX IT.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 02:00:27__

> I have poor internet service by the time i get the code the app wont accept it even though its about 10 to 20mins . I give up. Will see if i can actually speak to someone.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 11:17:18__

> The number of businesses that have a different scan are too many. This one doesn't register.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 03:07:54__

> This app was so useful, even just the times I had forgotten to take my wallet with me. Although, I'm unsure if it's an app update or something on my end but the app no longer works at all. When I try to log in I get a message that says " It looks like your device may be using non-standard software" I have the same SG20+ & it definitely has the original OS, doesn't have any ROMs, and has been certified by Google. I'd love for someone to point me in the direction of how to fix this, Thank you :)<br> :date: __2020-12-12 03:20:16__

> Inaccessible. Allows drivers licence scan, but not photo id or any disability related info. In other words it neglects us. Typical nsw govt attitude. QR codes are not accessible to people with vision loss . No alternative. Typical nsw govt. Also you Put fishing licences above anyone with photo id. Poor priorities there. Both are easy to set up but you ignore disabled people. Your IT people should have a long hard think. Equity must be addressed.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 11:20:51__

> Tried using the app DOESN'T WORK tried multi times.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:07:43__

> Doesnt allow me to put in code..must put email again..then code is invalid<br> :date: __2020-12-28 02:22:23__

> Why would I give this nsw covid app access to my phone photos, storage files. Piss off<br> :date: __2020-12-27 23:16:46__

> Too hard for seniors to download. We Ness easy prompts to follow. Don't know if it's ready to use or not<br> :date: __2020-12-27 19:00:59__

> Does not work<br> :date: __2020-12-27 11:01:34__

> Asked me for a 'strong' password. One that I won't remember, probably. I'm only registering to check in for COVID, not to access financial personal info! You had already verified my email. What more do you need? So, no thanks, Service NSW. I used the web form which was quick and painless and only wanted my name and phone number.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 07:24:50__

> Ap wont download. 3rd attempt. Waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:06:33__
