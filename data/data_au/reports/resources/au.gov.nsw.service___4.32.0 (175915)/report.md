## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app works really well. With respect to the COVID registration - when asking for dependents, is it possible to add a drop down list to store names and phone numbers? It needs to be editable.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:46:37__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2020-12-30 07:06:36__

> With Service NSW QR codes about to become mandatory, I'd like to see the following things to come up to five stars: - a widget to create a shortcut on your home screen directly to the QR check-in function - a persistent notification while you're checked in somewhere with a shortcut to check out - ability to save details of frequent companions so that you can quickly and easily check them in with you.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:40:57__

> A pain to set up but easy to use once it is going<br> :date: __2020-12-17 12:46:54__

> Issue resolved by reinstalling app :) TY! Check-in option is great feature. Would suggest adding optional location based notification for when you leave a venue so you can checkout right away. Keep up the good work folks!<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:18:45__

> Vulnerable<br> :date: __2020-12-14 23:11:56__

> There should be only one kind of QR Scan, it is too confusing and very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:56:32__

> Easy to use, but not all Riverina venues use it. What are its limitations?<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:32:42__

> Only used it once.. it worked ok, but I had to copy and paste confirmation numbers. I don't like the way that some venues don't use the dot Gov website. You have to entrust your information with strangers. If this is law that we must comply with.. venues should use the same website. The app for ACT is less intrusive.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:23:05__

> Current HTC phone with updated Android OS. This app appears to auto update, ignoring the settings to not do so on the phone. This then crashes the badly written app for managing my hearing aids and needs a 40 minute process to remove and reinstall the hearing aid app and reset the hearing aids.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 23:05:42__

> Haven't been able to get the COVID check in to work at any venues. Staff always say it never works on Samsung phones. Everything else is good that I've used in the app, but not being able to check in anywhere is annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 10:54:51__

> The App wont work on my pure android Nokia7+ because i choose to have all permissions that can be denied...denied and still have the phone operate as a phone. My phone is factory standard and hasn't had the operating system modified in any way. The fact that I don't log in to google shouldn't prevent me from accessing my details held by the government....simple two factor authentication is all that is needed for security. So now it works.....and when it works it is handy.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 02:06:53__

> Service NSW covid safe app uses NSW time but Broken Hill in FW NSW is on SA time so the times recorded are 1/2 out.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 01:15:25__

> Poor<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:30:22__

> Doesn't auto checkout when you scan the next code... just rechecks in to the first place you scanned. So I went through a whole day checking in to the same restaurant 10 times!<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:01:50__

> The app is difficult to access I have an Android phone and the email address and my usual password don't work I will have to yes a laptop computer to allow a password change.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 06:20:13__

> Use to be able to all sort of thing on this app, even do a notice of disposal. Now every transaction is gone, replace with checking demerit point and pay fine. Totally useless. Bring back notice of disposal, rego check, easy services like that will be tremendously useful<br> :date: __2021-01-02 05:03:40__

> Try as I might I could not change back from my sisters account to mine. Thus no dig DL or QR code camera FOR ME.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:33:20__

> Not good<br> :date: __2020-12-31 09:57:58__

> While the app is easy to use the check in and check out function for covid does not allow you to use any other phone features. If you make a call or search something online then switch back to the app it has automatically reset itself to welcome screen. This means for covid you need to keep a record of when you leave places.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 01:54:51__

> Tried to use this app today in Tarago NSW. Was able to download using wifi, but hit a roadblock because I had no mobile signal so couldn't receive the code sent via sms.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 07:50:44__

> The covid checkin will not on Oppo A57 it is definitely service Nsw QR Code. It works fine on my Samsung Galaxy note 7. Can you update for Oppo??<br> :date: __2020-12-27 09:40:51__
