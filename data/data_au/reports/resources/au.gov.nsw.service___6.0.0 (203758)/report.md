## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app but the biometric login is broken.... So if your fingerprint scanner and home button are built into one (as is the case on most devices) I'll place my finger on the scanner and it'll go back home not actually log me in! Frustrating especially when you're trying to check-in for covid safe every 2mins.....<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:48:36__

> Cannot access form<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:52:11__

> Works ok on newer phones but plenty of older people have pre Android 6.0 devices and guess what? Not suitable for your device message is all you get. Surely you can make it work on older devices that can't be updated?<br> :date: __2021-02-17 05:01:46__

> Frustrating.... No issues checking in but for the last 2 days it won't let me check out. Comes up with "unable to check out please try again. Physically can not check out until I check in at another location. I have been checked into one place for 15hrs until I have needed to check in somewhere else. Covid tracing data hard to get right if I am not able to check out ☹<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:32:07__

> After check in it often shuts down and I can't check out<br> :date: __2021-02-15 02:51:39__

> Checking in appears to work just fine including providing a confirmation that I'm checked in, but... When I go to check out, the check in feature has restarted and no check in was recorded. I've tried reinstalling the app and still have this issue, the rest of the app is great. The covid check in feature literally does not work. The UX could use some work also, if i've recently checked in somewhere and then I open the app, it should open up to the check out page.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 03:26:43__

> Mostly good at what it should do. The Covid check-in dad been moved to the app allowing you to scan a business' barcode. However, when the app is sent to the background, upon resumption the app's forgotten you've just checked in and brings up the confirmation of details screen again. If you proceed here, the app then checks you in again to the place you had just checked in at. Trying to check out is just as painful as once the app resumes, it again wants to check you in. It all works backwards<br> :date: __2021-02-12 02:47:57__

> Unable to load digital copy of recreational fishing licence<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:23:01__

> Having trouble getting some basic information<br> :date: __2021-02-10 02:10:39__

> Does what it needs to. With all the covid check-in I do, would be faster & easier if the covid check in feature was an app on its own.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 11:15:27__

> Ease to install. Thanks.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 12:33:38__

> This app was working fine for me for almost a year then all of a sudden out of nowhere it will no longer let me in. It rejected my (correct) 4 digit code and after logging out to see if that aids the problem, it won't let me log back in. I've reset my password and I can access my account on the website, but the app still won't log me in. Despite ensuring correct log in information, I'm still being told it's incorrect. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:40:27__

> Can't log out of location very easily. Have to book in again and then log out straight away.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 01:18:36__

> Does anyone know how to add this icon onto their home page for quicker access? Fed up having to access play store to open it every time I need to sign in at places.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 23:12:15__

> I have to continuously logon to checkin or checkout. It chews my battery. I should not have to rescan the qr code for places I visit regularly. The covid checkin should have its own widget . Designed by people with no app experience.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 00:41:10__

> I am so frustrated with this app. Initially it was working with no problems, then all of a sudden it stopped allowing me to check in saying to check the accuracy of the time on my phone? I have since been trying to log in and it continues to say incorrect password even though I know it is correct as I can sign in via the web. Dead set frustrating and I still have no reason why it happened to begin with. Uninstall, here I come.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:08:09__

> I'll DC<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:42:15__

> As no data on my phone the QR code login will not work. Many places I have visited get annoyed . Some have said they will check us in, in a while but either forget or just don't. Some have said they will have no other choice but to refuse entry !. I looked this up and now know they can not do this. Again today another cafe did not sign us in !!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 11:54:27__

> Check in at a venue on a bus etc, check out. Next place I check in it loads previous location or the one before saying I haven't checked out or to check in there again. You need to sort out the bugs to make the contact tracing precise. Attention to detail is important here.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 07:26:52__

> Latest update has created check-in/out issues, unable to do either<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:52:16__

> Incorrect password at login stage. It is super frustrating as I need to upload and provide certain information for my new employer however I can't because it won't let me login. I've attempted to reset my password for weeks now and same issue.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 22:26:36__

> App wouldn't update so i deleted it. Now tried to install new app and it won't download??<br> :date: __2021-02-25 07:10:25__

> App doesn't work and won't let me sign in. Reinstalled it and updated the password and still can't use app. Please fix it, businesses get annoyed<br> :date: __2021-02-24 20:59:26__

> Whatever changed with the app has caused my login attempts to keep failing. I can login to the service nsw webpage using the same credentials, but not the app anymore. Such a pity as this was a useful app. :(<br> :date: __2021-02-24 17:08:39__

> There's is a problem with this app it's stop working please fixed asap.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 09:14:55__

> Suddenly my pin was incorrect won't log me in so I tried login in with email says incorrect password. I've changed nothing.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 20:08:34__

> When I try to add licence, it keeps telling me to add email to link Roads and Maritime records. When I click add, it says success but again gets back to that page to add link.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 02:16:46__
