## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app but the biometric login is broken.... So if your fingerprint scanner and home button are built into one (as is the case on most devices) I'll place my finger on the scanner and it'll go back home not actually log me in! Frustrating especially when you're trying to check-in for covid safe every 2mins.....<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:48:36__

> Cannot access form<br> :date: __2021-02-19 00:52:11__

> Works ok on newer phones but plenty of older people have pre Android 6.0 devices and guess what? Not suitable for your device message is all you get. Surely you can make it work on older devices that can't be updated?<br> :date: __2021-02-17 05:01:46__

> Frustrating.... No issues checking in but for the last 2 days it won't let me check out. Comes up with "unable to check out please try again. Physically can not check out until I check in at another location. I have been checked into one place for 15hrs until I have needed to check in somewhere else. Covid tracing data hard to get right if I am not able to check out ☹<br> :date: __2021-02-16 00:32:07__

> After check in it often shuts down and I can't check out<br> :date: __2021-02-15 02:51:39__

> Checking in appears to work just fine including providing a confirmation that I'm checked in, but... When I go to check out, the check in feature has restarted and no check in was recorded. I've tried reinstalling the app and still have this issue, the rest of the app is great. The covid check in feature literally does not work. The UX could use some work also, if i've recently checked in somewhere and then I open the app, it should open up to the check out page.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 03:26:43__

> Mostly good at what it should do. The Covid check-in dad been moved to the app allowing you to scan a business' barcode. However, when the app is sent to the background, upon resumption the app's forgotten you've just checked in and brings up the confirmation of details screen again. If you proceed here, the app then checks you in again to the place you had just checked in at. Trying to check out is just as painful as once the app resumes, it again wants to check you in. It all works backwards<br> :date: __2021-02-12 02:47:57__

> Unable to load digital copy of recreational fishing licence<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:23:01__

> Having trouble getting some basic information<br> :date: __2021-02-10 02:10:39__

> Does what it needs to. With all the covid check-in I do, would be faster & easier if the covid check in feature was an app on its own.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 11:15:27__

> I am so frustrated with this app. Initially it was working with no problems, then all of a sudden it stopped allowing me to check in saying to check the accuracy of the time on my phone? I have since been trying to log in and it continues to say incorrect password even though I know it is correct as I can sign in via the web. Dead set frustrating and I still have no reason why it happened to begin with. Uninstall, here I come.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:08:09__

> I'll DC<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:42:15__

> As no data on my phone the QR code login will not work. Many places I have visited get annoyed . Some have said they will check us in, in a while but either forget or just don't. Some have said they will have no other choice but to refuse entry !. I looked this up and now know they can not do this. Again today another cafe did not sign us in !!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 11:54:27__

> Check in at a venue on a bus etc, check out. Next place I check in it loads previous location or the one before saying I haven't checked out or to check in there again. You need to sort out the bugs to make the contact tracing precise. Attention to detail is important here.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 07:26:52__

> Latest update has created check-in/out issues, unable to do either<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:52:16__

> Ok app in principle...the app used to work ok on my Samsung s8 phone but I got a new Samsung a51 and its glitchy. I can't reliably scan and login nor scan then logout of a premise. I try 10 to 20 times and it doesn't work. Sometimes it works after a few tries, sometimes it doesn't work at all. This happens at multiple sites not just one QR code site. Eventually I give up which isn't good. I have the latest app version on my phone. Can you please help?<br> :date: __2021-02-15 23:01:42__

> Nothing seems to work?<br> :date: __2021-02-15 03:32:21__

> This app is useless for anything other than vovid check-in. I can't add my licence without contacting services by phone. I can't register the car due to the app not being available at this time. Once everything works, it would be a great app!!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 00:21:29__

> Worked fine but now its saying I have the wrong email or password and I know that I am using the correct ones. So I cant log in any more<br> :date: __2021-02-14 09:51:12__

> Says "cannot verify phone number" and then does nothing. However, I am somewhat relieved that this terribly-programmed app fails at its task of facilitating gross government overreach and invasion of privacy so for that it gets an extra star.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 02:24:57__

> When I try to add licence, it keeps telling me to add email to link Roads and Maritime records. When I click add, it says success but again gets back to that page to add link.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 02:16:46__

> Goverment Rubbish cant log in using samsung Galaxy s10, Cant get help from Service NSW they put you on hold than cut me off all to hard for them , Cant log in means cant see digital license cant view my rego so im deleting the rubbish and that means no Covid check in , both service nsw and the developer off this app are scum cant get any help .<br> :date: __2021-02-22 08:44:33__

> Doesnt work after February update. Tried to reinstall AND reset my password AND both to no avail. Login is fine on the web so it's an app problem.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 07:52:04__

> I have downloaded the service nsw app but I cannot access any services or download the co vid sign in app. It will not accept my current email address to log in ? WHY !!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 04:13:54__

> Covid app is useless and doesn't work most of the time and unbelievably not with nsw health. Pin keeps not working, doesn't remember my log in details. Total waste of time<br> :date: __2021-02-22 02:41:48__

> One of the most disfunctional apps in the app store. Not sure where to start. Apps are supposed to make things easier. But this one definitely doesn't. Have to manually re enter everything every time I covid check in. Have to re login whenever I use a different service within the app. If you forget your password you can get sent a code. But can't get the code without the app closing and you have to send for it again. Could only be designed by government.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 07:50:27__

> Latest update QR code not reading at many places.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 04:34:50__

> When you go to create an account, it tells you to make a password of 8 or more numbers, letters & symbols. I've done that & it still won't accept my password. I've tried over 20 times. It's ridiculous!!! No help at all!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-21 04:18:01__

> This is quite a bad experience. I am able to login online into my account but unable to do so on my new phone and a clean install. I have tried this a few times. Quite a poor implementation must say.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 02:43:09__
