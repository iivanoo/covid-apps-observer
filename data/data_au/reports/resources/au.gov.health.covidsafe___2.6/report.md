### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> What a waste<br> :date: __2021-05-30 09:27:22__

> If this app worked we wouldn't be doing QR code scans. Go figure.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 01:36:48__

> Ever since the update it drops out whenever I'm in town. Works best at home on my wifi, but as soon as I switch to data, it drops out at random times. Not very safe.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 04:12:29__

> Im hoping that this update is going to work, my covid app , wouldn't scan, kept coming up with the red alert,this started last friday, switching phone off didnt do a thing,.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 06:27:02__

> Latest update of May is causing phone battery drainage. It is responsible for 50% of battery usage and phone needs charging twice everyday. I have a brand new Samsung phone.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 02:34:47__

> It says the app isn't working because battery optimization is on & it isn't & I updated it & put blue tooth on & it still says the app isn't working! Why? It let's me know when I have blue tooth on or off so it must be working to a certain degree.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 23:51:34__

> Keeps shutting off my blu tooth<br> :date: __2021-05-18 04:51:42__

> SOME feedback might have made this a success. Eg from a daily count of connections, to a ping when a connection was made.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 01:58:39__

> Uses far too much battery power<br> :date: __2021-05-17 05:38:44__

> Consume 50% of my phone's battery... and don't really get any updates if this really works. I may just keep doing social distancing and contact check in.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 13:39:54__

> This app is a heavy battery user.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 12:41:47__

> Running android 7. Won't run for more than a few hours before stopping. Rubbish.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 10:54:44__

> Just doesn't report what it's doing Little impact on tracing<br> :date: __2021-05-30 10:14:41__

> No experience.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 07:32:27__

> Seems like a recent update has significantly impacted battery usage. My battery drained in 4 hrs, not interacting with it at all, with battery usage stats claiming it was 64% the covid safe app. Next highest app was 4%.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 05:15:04__

> With the upgrade the app hasn't worked at all<br> :date: __2021-05-29 11:38:31__

> Hopeless and expensive<br> :date: __2021-05-29 00:20:02__

> Badly run<br> :date: __2021-05-28 13:39:38__

> On Note 10, I don't have any of the problems others mention about bluetooth drop outs to car or Senheisser headphones or Samsung Watch. Edit:The version of the app in March 2021 has been the highest battery drainer in my apps list, battery that used to last 14 hours is lucky to make 10 hours now. April 2021 even worse, phone doesn't appear to go into low use standby, it is linearly draining the battery with Covidsafe app #1 on drain list.This app is killing my and wife battery in May 2021 <7Hrs.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 13:30:37__
