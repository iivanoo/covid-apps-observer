## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well and is informative<br> :date: __2020-07-04 22:02:51__

> Would be great if you could also put how many active cases there are.<br> :date: __2020-05-21 00:11:52__

> Works as expected, an information manager, not a source (otherwise the app would need updating daily). Helps to get at relevant, reliable information, without needing to hunt around the web myself to find it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 10:32:15__

> No idea if it works and hope I never find out<br> :date: __2020-10-29 09:53:40__

> Recent resource.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 05:43:12__

> Pros: good to know the official safe links here. Cons: it's really just a collection of web links, nothing more.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:47:47__

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Keeps turning itself off!<br> :date: __2020-05-19 04:42:12__

> It hasn't updated. Supposed to update at 9:00 AM daily.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 01:15:17__

> Never have received the pin to open it<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:20:55__

> Thanks to covid, father, the Vic Police Ringwood and the Au government I'm now nothing, thanks a lot. My death is all on your heads and I can't do this any more. Keep kicking me while I'm down when I'm unwell and did nothing wrong. I'm now shattered, disgusted and broken. Nothing left :(<br> :date: __2021-05-22 01:20:17__

> 3rd app installed, I hope this check in works<br> :date: __2021-02-06 04:14:58__

> This app works however the information shown in it is no longer being updated daily nor is the information on numbers as detailed as it once was. I write this review on 3rd Jan, the CoVid numbers shown on the app were last updated 21st Dec. Pretty worthless if you can't rely on it to show up to date information.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 04:57:49__

> Miss mash just looking for last 24 hours numbers by state.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 23:13:13__

> Was a pretty useless app, can find out the same info online or by watching the news<br> :date: __2020-07-27 04:56:10__

> Never been able to open app<br> :date: __2020-07-08 12:03:11__

> I'm sure it's a great app but there is constantly a reminder in my notifications that I can't get rid of. Very very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-05-28 18:16:57__

> Not enough real time information I would like to see more statistics especially our Reff number<br> :date: __2020-05-07 11:17:36__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__
