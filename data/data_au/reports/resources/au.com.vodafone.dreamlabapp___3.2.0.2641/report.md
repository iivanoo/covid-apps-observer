### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to start and stop, and feels like an easy and excellent way of helping at no cost to you! Win win.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 17:14:17__

> Very good to be contributing to research whilst charging my phone!<br> :date: __2021-02-06 17:09:53__

> Excellent app. No hassle and contributes so much.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 10:42:40__

> It's been an amazing experience. However, I am still trying to understand the science behind it, but so far I have varied my choices of research I have chosen to support, and my curiosity has brought me this far as I also monitor how I have been able to contribute to the research. It is worth a try if you love research 😊<br> :date: __2021-02-06 08:42:03__

> Thank you for the opportunity to contribute.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 23:35:21__

> Newest version reset my contribution record over 4+ years 😢<br> :date: __2021-02-05 09:43:25__

> Good to be useful<br> :date: __2021-02-04 10:14:31__

> good cause, free bandwidth, what can poosibly go wrong ?<br> :date: __2021-02-03 17:24:00__

> I don't understand how this works and use it only because I trust the person who suggested it. I think many people will be reluctant to download it for this reason.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 11:30:07__

> Please add an option for unlimited data usage, i have an unlimited plan with a Samsung fold 2nd gen and would like more of its power to be used for a good cause<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:49:42__

> App is good but could be better. The platform & institutions could take cues from BOINC's Android app's advance settings & notifications feature. Also, as others have mentioned, you need to keep the calculations coming at a steady rate or at least inform users if there will be a slow down. BOINC institutions do this - they inform users if there will be a pause for maintenance or other reasons.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 01:53:28__

> The apps really good.. Provides details and sources for the research you're helping with. Tells you the amount of time spent and problems your phone has solved. Best part is that it only works when plugged-in. So you don't have to worry about it draining your battery. The only drawback is that it kinda heats up the phone. But hey, your phone is helping humanity solve important issues without you having to anything... So pretty much a win-win.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 14:56:43__

> Only draw back is need to charge when in use<br> :date: __2021-01-28 08:50:26__

> DreamLab is a simple way of contributing your spare mobile processing power to community projects (eg. to help speed up Covid and cancer research). (As my device is a fast charging device, I would find it useful if it could optionally run while not charging.)<br> :date: __2021-01-27 10:35:15__

> Good but would use it more if it would run on battery, say above 50%<br> :date: __2021-01-22 09:19:17__

> Keep forgetting to start it at night when I plug in. A reminder would be good that can be toggled.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 09:03:00__

> I may not be doing much to help during the current crisis but it is nice to be able to make a small contribution<br> :date: __2021-01-20 08:18:34__

> Does tend to make phone get hot<br> :date: __2021-01-19 08:17:18__

> The job it does is fantastic. I'm not convinced it releases resources properly after charging as my battery runs down faster than expected after use...<br> :date: __2021-01-15 17:54:09__

> Great to help out but sometimes have difficulty starting a session due to 'used all daya' message<br> :date: __2021-01-30 17:01:33__

> The app is strange. Compred to folding@home it does not stimulate competition by giving you and Id, points, and the ability to gain more points by putting more devices under the same ID. Also it doesn't have any settings to allow me to use more or less resources. For instance it was initially using only one big core and now it seems to have settled for some of the little cores and I have no control over this behaviour. The app does not work in landscape mode which is very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 22:23:05__

> A great idea this but it does not automatically start calculations when I put my phone on charge. I have to manually start the calculations - it's rare I think to do so. There should be an in-app setting to allow automatic start upon plug in. 1 star lost because it's missing this obvious function. 1 star lost because without this function, the app is simply a waste of memory on my phone. Fix this and it's 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 18:53:46__

> Very nice app, however, I wish it has I control when the app starts crunching numbers, for example after my battery level is up to 99% for example and it will stop if the battery drops Below 90% and so on.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 14:54:10__

> Not as configurable as BOINC eg scheduling work. Too many thumb's up notifications. Can't adjust CPU usage.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 18:08:25__

> Good app but settings are severely lacking, no way of telling it when to run and when not to run. I'd like to be able to customise when to start a session and also why can't it be used without being plugged in? Surely using less CPU when it's not plugged in is better than not running at all? I'd also like to see it automatically start instead of needing me to go into the app and tapping start session.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:40:48__

> Great idea... But app needs more controls to limit cpu and send it can run<br> :date: __2020-12-14 11:23:42__

> I'd like to use this on my phone but it eats power faster than the wireless charger can charge it. The phone charges up to 80%, the app starts calculating, next thing I know despite the phone still being on the charger the battery has 70% in it and still falling. The app needs to check the charge level when it is running and avoid allowing the phone to be depleted if the phone is using more power than it is getting from the charger.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:38:48__

> It is a worthwhile app, however I find if it stops due to battery temp, it doesn't automatically restart, which is not so good as I find I may only gain 15 or 20 mins running each night..<br> :date: __2020-12-10 00:04:38__

> I am on Vodafone with unlimited Max, or whatever it is called.. Around 4 months ago, the app, or Vodafone seem to have applied a 500mg per month limit to the data usage, consequently, after the first week of the month, this app remains idle! Vodafone weren't much help, other than confirming the 500mg cap exists. Not happy.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 14:25:48__

> Not working all the time<br> :date: __2021-01-30 13:13:44__

> Unfortunately after consistant use of the app for a worthy cause, the battery life on my new Samsing S10 no longer lasts day even with minimal interaction. Will have to purchase a new phone.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 19:30:38__

> Needs more settings. 1. Pause if screen is on. 2. Max processor %. 3. Min % battery to begin processing. For some reason the jobs become stuck with no processing occuring while clock continues - maybe a download issue, it doesn't retry though. Needs a % & time counter per job counter so we can see if it's stuck or just a long job. Phone also slows when it's processing, the % processor option may help with this.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 02:23:48__

> use this on my work phone (moto) and a tablet with no issues, vut in my Samsung S7 it causes the phone to get really hot. Can you develop a way to select running at half speed or even less. I don't like the idea of heat cycling my phone every night.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 18:06:32__

> Doesn't show right progress, after every few deletes requires reinstall for knowing progress.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:22:12__

> It just won't stay running.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:36:07__

> Great idea, was excited to help but the app always crashes. Have turned it on every night for over a week and there hasn't been a single morning the app was still running and only clocked up 5 hours<br> :date: __2020-12-30 14:06:28__

> Stops calculating when charged but still plugged in, doesn't automatically start. Fix please!<br> :date: __2020-12-25 14:24:10__

> Uninstalled. Great idea, but too power intensive. Left the phone on charge over night and the battery only gained 2%.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:34:19__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> After having used this app religiously for many years without any problems. They now change your selected project to coronavirus against your will or knowledge. It doesn't matter what project you select. They will secretly change it to coronavirus. I have now deleted this app as I find it unethical.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 04:35:19__

> Good concept. My problem is that it kicks in whenever the phone is charging, not desirable when plugged into a powerbank. I use my phone as cycling computer and also with maps and use a powerbank so i can have the screen on all the time. If dreamlabs kicks in it drains the powerbank and phone battery at an amazing rate. It would help if it was possible to define the time period when dreamlab is active so it is restricted to overnight charging time. Running too often when not wanted so uninstall<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:26:03__

> Installed on my oneplus 8 and it instantly stopped responding and crashed out hence 1 star<br> :date: __2021-01-23 08:11:26__

> it seems that i cant use this for my current phone as it keeps overheating and pauses. my iphone seems to be doing a better job about 30 minutes in without pausing. On my android it pauses every 5 minutes or so. since i am not using my iphone so i will run it there. maybe my Android phone isnt good enough<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:09:06__

> Tells you nothing that you already know. All they do is count how many minutes on the website you are on and if a website counts how long you have been on for well that's suss in my opinion.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 22:33:52__

> Kept freezing Android 7 tablet & Android 9 phone. Unacceptable behaviour. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:44:11__

> I tried the app on my phone. My phone got red hot. So I tried it on my iPad. It drained the battery completely; unfortunately even while on charge. Had to delete it. Shame. I wanted to help....<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:45:36__

> Haven't a clue what is it<br> :date: __2020-12-07 18:42:59__

> I'm sorry. I wanted to help. But my phone won't charge. It drains faster than it charging. After 1 hour it got from 86% to 80% while plugged in. It's a Samsung S7 with a fast charger. You might want to look into this.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 14:13:42__
