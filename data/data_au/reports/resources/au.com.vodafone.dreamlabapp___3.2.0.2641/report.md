### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Make this app more visible to the public!!! Make the projects' status cards easily sharable as stories and posts on social media.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:11:33__

> a great app that allows everybody around the world to contribute to the treatment of serious diseases. the only problems are that the calculation of time stops every time that updates are introduced in the app and you need to start the clock from the beginning as well as the fact that the research projects receive plenty of calculations during a small period of time at the beginning of the project and until the project reaches the 50% ; from that point and until its total completion, the calculations are gathered in a more difficult way. moreover, this app should start working on the pc and not only on the mobile phone, so that the treatment and the cure be achieved more quickly.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:25:58__

> It's brilliant. I can help with no effort on my part 😁 It can be set to just use wi-fi as I don't have much data allowance.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:40:54__

> I love being able to help cancer research.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 16:09:23__

> Excellent use of an idle phone or tablet but where is the share button to add to Facebook twitter etc?<br> :date: __2020-12-04 16:00:32__

> Brilliant. I'll be running this off my solar during the day when the sun shines. It would be good to have a second button on the home screen "complete current calculation and Close".<br> :date: __2020-12-04 12:42:20__

> Easy to use, runs in the background, able to set all data settings.. All goes towards good causes, it's a win win!<br> :date: __2020-12-04 12:23:26__

> Fantastic app to allow for everyday people to assist with compute power for some of the most pressing issues in science.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 11:00:43__

> To everyone who is saying 'drains my battery'. USE OVERNIGHT WHILE YOUR PHONE IS PLUGGED IN YOU WOMBATS. Yes - You can set data limits if you need to. Settings. Yes - You can share the app. Settings. Amazing app that actually helps the world!<br> :date: __2020-12-04 09:51:35__

> A very worthwhile app. It really helps scientists to crunch data while your phone charges. Mine has already helped research into COVID-19 and cancer.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 08:30:59__

> I would like to see a manual throttling option to help prevent the phone getting warm rather than decide for itself But this app should come with every phone. Simple to use, extremely worthwhile, and unobtrusive.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:58:23__

> It is an interesting project. One improvement suggestion: more settings, specifically to be able to set times when it's allowed to run (e.g. overnight only). It is good that it only runs when plugged in (though that could also be a setting), but when it runs it does take quite a bit of processing power, and the phone runs warm - I would like it to only turn on when I'm genuinely not using the phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 17:13:15__

> Any chance you can make your application compatible with Android TV and also the new Google TV with Chromecast? I certainly don't mind donating CPU time of my Google TV with Chromecast. It's left powered up 24/7/365. J just ask thaat if you do, that your app operates at the lowest priority to all other processes in the Google TV dongle.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 12:07:38__

> A great way to donate to important scientific research without costing you extra money.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 22:19:48__

> Its convenient & a great idea. It may be a bit too powerfull for my moto g3 as it has had to take time out to cool down. Raises the thought about damage, but I will continue.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 11:11:51__

> App has stopped working since latest update. Just sits at zero all the time whether I'm on Wi-Fi or mobile data. Please fix it.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 00:59:02__

> Only used it a couple nights now and it's working fine on my Android A71. Suggestions: Some way to send info/ad about it to friends. Also an autostart or at least a reminder to start whenever phone is plugged in or at a set-able time every day.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 16:08:09__

> UPDATE: Do notice a bit of slowdown if I try streaming or use badly made websites, but nothing major, and you can always pause it if you notice issues. But below still stands. Runs faultlessly on my Xperia. I normally only have it running when I sleep and it doesn't interfere with my sleep tracking.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 08:08:27__

> It seems to have cleared any bugs. It seizes up in warm weather when the phone is on charge and getting warm, but is a lot better in not so warm weather. And of it helps with the research then it is doing a good job while I am in bed, asleep, at night.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 08:05:08__

> I can only give 4 stars, because the mobile data is limited to 500mb and it seems that in the past 2 months is using those 500mb in 2 weeks, why not giving the option of more data to any user (i have an unlimited data abb on my mobile carier) so that i don't use the wireless in the house...<br> :date: __2020-10-25 21:36:47__

> Great idea, but I tend to wirelessly charge my phone. This doesn't provide enough power to run the app and charge, so my phone runs out of battery while on the charger. It would be great if the app could tell the difference between wired and wireless charging.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:36:49__

> It seems like a great idea. However, I have an issue where the app appears to not be working when I move to another app or turn the screen off (the contribution amount does not increase) but is shown as running on my task manager. The app also continues to run even when the phone is unplugged. It might be that its not compatible with my Vivo x50.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 15:06:23__

> Most of the time I put my phone on charge, the app doesn't work it just crash by itself<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:09:06__

> This is a great app, if you're like me and have unlimited data then you can leave overnight to charge and contribute. The only issue I have with this is like many users, there isn't enough advertisement surrounding this so it remains fairly unknown. If this was standard throughout all Vodafone devices and required users to Opt out, then I feel there would be more of a buzz surrounding this.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:59:39__

> I'm unclear exactly how this thing works, and that concerns me a bit It fires up any time I put my phone on the charger... Day or night I am on my home wifi... I have yet to see if it turns on in the car when I plug the charger in... I never use all my data each month but that doesn't mean I want to risk it while driving I was under the impression the app only runs at night (I am in the US, if that matters)... But there is no way to set a schedule that allows it to run only during certain hours<br> :date: __2020-11-16 04:59:26__

> Great idea, but I've got a problem after some hours of use, since it starts crashing just after enabling or even just opening it; both on Android 7 and iPadOs 14<br> :date: __2020-11-15 13:39:57__

> Id like to be able to turn on dreamlab without charging. For example, in my evening routine, b4 I plug my phone. Or when home, walking around with my phone, I'd turn on drmlb. I don't mind if that drains my battery, because I'd be close to a charger anyway. Now it's hard to integrate the task of turning on drmlb into my evening routine since I can only do it when my phone is plugged in. A reminder to turn on dreamlab when plugging in would b helpful as well. Or drmlb would turn on automaticlly?<br> :date: __2020-10-29 07:51:26__

> Installed without my knowledge. Vodafone is now into bloatware. Regardless of the good intentions and I know that they are good, you should be given the option to opt in. I found out about it when I started getting notifications about an App I knew nothing about<br> :date: __2020-10-27 19:27:45__

> Simple app. Great idea. Waste of time if you're not even to advertise the thing. This should be am opt out app on every person's phone me. You should be on Facebook hammering this out to everyone. It feels like a box you guys have ticked, so you can talk about it at dinner parties. The potential of this thing could cure some major problems, use it.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 10:10:48__

> I'm disappointed that I can't contribute more data because I'm with Telstra and not Vodafone. If we can help find a cure for cancer it will help save lives of people will this horrible disease. My 14 year old great nephew died in June from a brain tumour, it only took 10 months from diagnosis to kill him. We need to stop cancer from killing our love ones.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 07:13:53__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> Insgesamt natürlich eine wichtige und wertvolle Idee, die App an sich hat aber noch Luft nach oben. Vorschläge: 1. Eine Option die Berechnungen erst ab einem gewissen Ladestand des Akkus zu starten. 2. Ein besseres Tracking der eigenen Beiträge, evtl. userbasiert und mit Highscore Listen (wie z.B. bei Folding) über mehrere Geräte hinweg, das motiviert zusätzlich. 3. Aktuell kaum nutzbar wenn man sein Smartphone per Schnellladefunktion lädt, weil es zu heiß wird. Hier muss nachgebessert werden.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 14:52:04__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'take a break' to cool down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again. Pixel 4 XL<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:08:41__

> Worked for about 3 days. After that, the app keeps crashing. Reinstall helped just for the first use. Now keeps crashing down again. Pity<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:12:55__

> Having to uninstall as phone runs way too hot when this is running<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:29:49__

> The idea is nice, but it drains the battery instead of having settings to work only when charging and from some battery percentage. EDIT: You say that it works only when charging, but there is no indication for it. Please update the app to show it. Also please have settings, to disallow it being used when below some percentage (I want it to stop when below 95% for example).<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:34:48__

> This app should have an option to work at 50% or even less of the processing power while not charging my phone. It doesn't really make sense when most smartphones have an ultra fast charging and doesn't need to be charged overnight. EDIT: App stopped working and doesn't do any calculations anymore...<br> :date: __2020-10-31 22:27:03__

> Interesting idea but still having issues with the app crashing.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:54:04__

> I'm having a lot of technical difficulties with this app quite recently. I've had to uninstall the app 4 times, and install again just to get it to work properly. Apart from that, I love this app. Please fix this problem. Thank you.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 15:11:35__

> I'm sorry. I wanted to help. But my phone won't charge. It drains faster than it charging. After 1 hour it got from 86% to 80% while plugged in. It's a Samsung S7 with a fast charger. You might want to look into this.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 14:13:42__

> This app used to work perfectly but now refuses to work at all. It just claims that I've reached my data limit for the month despite the fact that I'm using WiFi. I have tried deleting it and reinstalling it several times but it still doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:21:34__

> Used to be great but now everytime I charge my phone the app crashes<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:32:30__

> I used to love this app but something in the most recent updates has been causing the phone's temp to rise and it keeps having to take a break. It never used to do that and it's to the point where the phone is hot to touch when it runs and this is when there are no other apps running in the background.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:09:32__

> Worked well for the first day, then crashed constantly every night/ charge following. Made the phone almost impossible to use prior to uninstalling due to all the crashes occurring.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:07:07__

> Idea itself is worthwhile, however after a few days the app will stop working or crash when you plug in the power. No support, no replies to messages. Constantly requires uninstalling and install if you want to continue supporting the projects, however your history/contributions are erased.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 23:10:19__

> Does not automatically start when power plugged in. Missed out on months of potential calculations.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 21:31:21__
