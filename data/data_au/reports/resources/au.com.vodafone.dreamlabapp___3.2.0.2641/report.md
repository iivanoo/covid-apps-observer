### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app<br> :date: __2021-03-05 19:26:33__

> Great to be able to provide support for such an innovative and potentially valuable programme. All working quietly in the background, and at no appreciable cost. If we all come together to do this, think of the difference we can make.8o<br> :date: __2021-03-04 09:08:38__

> we try...<br> :date: __2021-03-02 14:26:46__

> An interesting app to rate as it works in the background so I have no idea what it is doing. But I do get messages saying thank-you from time to time. If it could be improved a bit of feedback from the team explaining in more detail what they are doing would be helpful. At the moment it could be calculating the best route to deliver newspapers for all I know. There is just a hint at the moment that I am being taken for granted.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 08:27:32__

> If want to help out download this it's easy to use<br> :date: __2021-03-02 03:08:20__

> Everyone should use this app period. The only annoying thing is you must run the app with the phone on charge and leave it. If you out the phone into sleep mode it stops the apl for some reason.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 17:23:27__

> If you don't have it, why not?<br> :date: __2021-03-01 12:54:36__

> No problems.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 21:10:09__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-27 13:30:19__

> I think this app should be downloaded by everybody. All you need to do is plug your phone in and voila your helping cure cancer. It's easy to use. And really is just an amazing app with a great cause.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 12:19:38__

> Brilliant citizen science<br> :date: __2021-03-03 21:08:00__

> Doesn't work on android 9 now works on 5 and 6, Update ,now works perfectly. Only thing is I wish it did it in landscape mode,not automatically switch to portrait<br> :date: __2021-03-03 00:41:04__

> Supported for 2 years, but as my phone dies, Can't seem to stop it from running without uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 11:27:13__

> It's a nice idea but has a few things that bug me. It doesn't always connect to the server, sometimes if I reboot my phone it fixes the issue but I can't usually be bothered. It doesn't just auto run when I connect power so I often forget to start it. I hope you get to see the papers that are produced from the data you have crunched.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 13:01:58__

> I want to give this 5 stars because the idea is great. Only knocked down to 4 because it doesn't always work, starting automatically at 80% charge. Maybe this is a problem with the APIs available, but it would be good it they could find a way around it. I'd be happy if it always started when charging, even if that slows charging a bit. Maybe that could be made an option.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 09:28:14__

> Darei 5 stelle, ma non sempre l'app parte in automatico quando attacco il telefono alla presa<br> :date: __2021-02-18 00:17:15__

> Can make my phone a bit hotter than I am comfortable with.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 23:03:54__

> App is good but could be better. The platform & institutions should take cues from BOINC's Android app's advance settings & notification feature. Also, as others have mentioned, you need to keep the calculations coming at a steady rate or at least inform users if there will be a slow down. BOINC institutions do this - they inform users if there will be a pause for maintenance or other reasons.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:45:34__

> I love the fact I can use this app and feel like I'm making a difference, currently I'm at home alot so when I'm not actively using my phone or I'm asleep I just let the app run, I would not recommend powering a project if your actively using the device however because it's using your phone as a processor for constant calculations it gets very hot and slows down all other stuff, but if you dont actively use your phone much while it charges it's a great tool to make a difference!<br> :date: __2021-02-09 13:29:37__

> Like helping out<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:40:23__

> Presumably im helping. Boinc is better. Give more feedback on how we are helping. Also gridcoin being an additional bonus that potentially may have value in the far future. Why bother with this? It is nice if you are not very technical or dont want to fall into the rabbit hole of the many different sciences connected to boinc. If you want no hassle just do this. But if I want more meaningful results I use other platforms. I just need more feedback I guess. This platform is "ok" at least.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 14:06:45__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-02-24 19:10:42__

> It's ok but the app causes overheating of phone. Battery got really bloated and caused the handphone casing to bend. Was told if I replaced the screen one day, it would put extreme pressure on the battery and possibly cause the battery to explode.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 19:48:38__

> Leaves me wondering. I try to give lots of time to the calculations but sometimes I get a calc done every 10 seconds and other times every 5 mins or so. I do not feel the owners update at their end often enough. Users need to see progress if they are to stay motivated to do this work<br> :date: __2021-02-20 02:57:49__

> App has a nasty habit of switching away from the project I selected to covid-19. For those of us on an unlimited plan there is no way to set the data is can use to unlimited. I would also like more options/projects to choose from to support. Any chance you could find ones in USA?<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:32:49__

> Good idea, but only seems to run for 10 minutes a night on my phone. The rest of the time it says it's letting the phone cool - phone is stone cold...<br> :date: __2021-02-08 09:21:24__

> Great to help out but sometimes have difficulty starting a session due to 'used all daya' message<br> :date: __2021-01-30 17:01:33__

> The app is strange. Compred to folding@home it does not stimulate competition by giving you and Id, points, and the ability to gain more points by putting more devices under the same ID. Also it doesn't have any settings to allow me to use more or less resources. For instance it was initially using only one big core and now it seems to have settled for some of the little cores and I have no control over this behaviour. The app does not work in landscape mode which is very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 22:23:05__

> A great idea this but it does not automatically start calculations when I put my phone on charge. I have to manually start the calculations - it's rare I think to do so. There should be an in-app setting to allow automatic start upon plug in. 1 star lost because it's missing this obvious function. 1 star lost because without this function, the app is simply a waste of memory on my phone. Fix this and it's 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 18:53:46__

> Very nice app, however, I wish it has I control when the app starts crunching numbers, for example after my battery level is up to 99% for example and it will stop if the battery drops Below 90% and so on.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 14:54:10__

> App doesn't start up when plugged in, even on manual start, just keeps saying data will restart the following month, even though setting is for wifi.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 02:00:52__

> What's the reason for rarely updating users on progress % of research project? It's really irritating to dedicate hours of your devices power for weeks and still not see the percentage budge.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 08:51:42__

> Needs more settings. 1. Pause if screen is on. 2. Max processor %. 3. Min % battery to begin processing. For some reason the jobs become stuck with no processing occuring while clock continues - maybe a download issue, it doesn't retry though. Needs a % & time counter per job counter so we can see if it's stuck or just a long job. Phone also slows when it's processing, the % processor option may help with this. Update: now it says Ive reached my monthly data limit which I can't increase over 1gb<br> :date: __2021-02-27 00:17:45__

> You are trying to download the free ringtones for my phone but it won't let you<br> :date: __2021-02-20 06:33:56__

> Not working all the time<br> :date: __2021-01-30 13:13:44__

> Unfortunately after consistant use of the app for a worthy cause, the battery life on my new Samsing S10 no longer lasts day even with minimal interaction. Will have to purchase a new phone.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 19:30:38__

> use this on my work phone (moto) and a tablet with no issues, vut in my Samsung S7 it causes the phone to get really hot. Can you develop a way to select running at half speed or even less. I don't like the idea of heat cycling my phone every night.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 18:06:32__

> Doesn't show right progress, after every few deletes requires reinstall for knowing progress.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:22:12__

> It just won't stay running.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:36:07__

> Great idea, was excited to help but the app always crashes. Have turned it on every night for over a week and there hasn't been a single morning the app was still running and only clocked up 5 hours<br> :date: __2020-12-30 14:06:28__

> Used it for a few years. Was a good app. Then for 2 months in a row it claimed I'd used all my data allocation on the first day. Uninstalled and reinstalled and was considered a new user.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 12:20:49__

> Stop and start, changes what youve sekected rubbish<br> :date: __2021-02-26 01:19:42__

> This app will damage your phone's battery. I've been using it for months now but have steadily noticed that my phone is not lasting a full day anymore, initially blamed my usage but it was suggested to me that the app may be the cause. I checked in with others who I encouraged to also download this app and they have had the same issue. I uninstalled several days ago and my battery life has not improved so it appears to be permanent. I now feel responsible for damaging mine and my friends phones.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 11:29:24__

> After having used this app religiously for many years without any problems. They now change your selected project to coronavirus against your will or knowledge. It doesn't matter what project you select. They will secretly change it to coronavirus. I have now deleted this app as I find it unethical.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 04:35:19__

> Good concept. My problem is that it kicks in whenever the phone is charging, not desirable when plugged into a powerbank. I use my phone as cycling computer and also with maps and use a powerbank so i can have the screen on all the time. If dreamlabs kicks in it drains the powerbank and phone battery at an amazing rate. It would help if it was possible to define the time period when dreamlab is active so it is restricted to overnight charging time. Running too often when not wanted so uninstall<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:26:03__

> Installed on my oneplus 8 and it instantly stopped responding and crashed out hence 1 star<br> :date: __2021-01-23 08:11:26__

> it seems that i cant use this for my current phone as it keeps overheating and pauses. my iphone seems to be doing a better job about 30 minutes in without pausing. On my android it pauses every 5 minutes or so. since i am not using my iphone so i will run it there. maybe my Android phone isnt good enough<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:09:06__

> Tells you nothing that you already know. All they do is count how many minutes on the website you are on and if a website counts how long you have been on for well that's suss in my opinion.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 22:33:52__

> Kept freezing Android 7 tablet & Android 9 phone. Unacceptable behaviour. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:44:11__

> I tried the app on my phone. My phone got red hot. So I tried it on my iPad. It drained the battery completely; unfortunately even while on charge. Had to delete it. Shame. I wanted to help....<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:45:36__
