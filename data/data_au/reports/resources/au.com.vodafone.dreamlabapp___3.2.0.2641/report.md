### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's good to help. The only problem I have found is that when charging my phone on a Pixel Stand it will not get above 80 percent as both the app and wireless charging cause the phone to get warm.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 21:44:09__

> I like contributing but would like more options e.g I'd like it to only work on WiFi and I'd like the app to automatically start and work when I plug in my phone to charge....sort of download set and forget.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 17:36:43__

> Works fine on my phone, drains my wife's Samsung faster than the charger can keep up<br> :date: __2020-12-22 08:05:18__

> Great to help research while asleep<br> :date: __2020-12-21 18:24:22__

> Really great cause. I would encourage everyone to use this app, it works very well too and is lightweight on data if that's a concern. No ads at all. Would be 5 stars if I could login and keep my progress/contributions across devices.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 00:21:24__

> Any chance you can make your application compatible with Android TV and also the new Google TV with Chromecast? I certainly don't mind donating CPU time of my Google TV with Chromecast. It's left powered up 24/7/365.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 18:54:53__

> Painless<br> :date: __2020-12-17 10:14:46__

> Great way of helping out. Did seem to hang phone once, but that could be something else<br> :date: __2020-12-17 09:15:04__

> Easy to use and if it helps..<br> :date: __2020-12-16 22:07:46__

> I run a system on my computers, called Bonic (24/7) which run similar scientific projects. I would like to see your project also running on PCs and not running on mobile phones, whilst charging.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 00:46:21__

> Needs an option to suspend processing if screen is on. On some phones it's using more power than its charging so battery goes down. Need to take a leaf out of boincs book.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 13:32:20__

> Good app but settings are severely lacking, no way of telling it when to run and when not to run. I'd like to be able to customise when to start a session and also why can't it be used without being plugged in? Surely using less CPU when it's not plugged in is better than not running at all? I'd also like to see it automatically start instead of needing me to go into the app and tapping start session.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:40:48__

> Great idea... But app needs more controls to limit cpu and send it can run<br> :date: __2020-12-14 11:23:42__

> I'd like to use this on my phone but it eats power faster than the wireless charger can charge it. The phone charges up to 80%, the app starts calculating, next thing I know despite the phone still being on the charger the battery has 70% in it and still falling. The app needs to check the charge level when it is running and avoid allowing the phone to be depleted if the phone is using more power than it is getting from the charger.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:38:48__

> It is a worthwhile app, however I find if it stops due to battery temp, it doesn't automatically restart, which is not so good as I find I may only gain 15 or 20 mins running each night..<br> :date: __2020-12-10 00:04:38__

> I am on Vodafone with unlimited Max, or whatever it is called.. Around 4 months ago, the app, or Vodafone seem to have applied a 500mg per month limit to the data usage, consequently, after the first week of the month, this app remains idle! Vodafone weren't much help, other than confirming the 500mg cap exists. Not happy.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 14:25:48__

> Great idea, however it caused my Galaxy Note 10+ 5g to overheat.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:57:34__

> Great idea, but I tend to wirelessly charge my phone. This doesn't provide enough power to run the app and charge, so my phone runs out of battery while on the charger. It would be great if the app could tell the difference between wired and wireless charging.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 18:36:49__

> It seems like a great idea. However, I have an issue where the app appears to not be working when I move to another app or turn the screen off (the contribution amount does not increase) but is shown as running on my task manager. The app also continues to run even when the phone is unplugged. It might be that its not compatible with my Vivo x50.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 15:06:23__

> Most of the time I put my phone on charge, the app doesn't work it just crash by itself<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:09:06__

> Stops calculating when charged but still plugged in, doesn't automatically start. Fix please!<br> :date: __2020-12-25 14:24:10__

> Uninstalled. Great idea, but too power intensive. Left the phone on charge over night and the battery only gained 2%.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:34:19__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> Insgesamt natürlich eine wichtige und wertvolle Idee, die App an sich hat aber noch Luft nach oben. Vorschläge: 1. Eine Option die Berechnungen erst ab einem gewissen Ladestand des Akkus zu starten. 2. Ein besseres Tracking der eigenen Beiträge, evtl. userbasiert und mit Highscore Listen (wie z.B. bei Folding) über mehrere Geräte hinweg, das motiviert zusätzlich. 3. Aktuell kaum nutzbar wenn man sein Smartphone per Schnellladefunktion lädt, weil es zu heiß wird. Hier muss nachgebessert werden.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 14:52:04__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'take a break' to cool down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again. Pixel 4 XL<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:08:41__

> Worked for about 3 days. After that, the app keeps crashing. Reinstall helped just for the first use. Now keeps crashing down again. Pity<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:12:55__

> Having to uninstall as phone runs way too hot when this is running<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:29:49__

> The idea is nice, but it drains the battery instead of having settings to work only when charging and from some battery percentage. EDIT: You say that it works only when charging, but there is no indication for it. Please update the app to show it. Also please have settings, to disallow it being used when below some percentage (I want it to stop when below 95% for example).<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:34:48__

> This app should have an option to work at 50% or even less of the processing power while not charging my phone. It doesn't really make sense when most smartphones have an ultra fast charging and doesn't need to be charged overnight. EDIT: App stopped working and doesn't do any calculations anymore...<br> :date: __2020-10-31 22:27:03__

> Interesting idea but still having issues with the app crashing.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:54:04__

> Kept freezing Android 7 tablet & Android 9 phone. Unacceptable behaviour. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:44:11__

> I tried the app on my phone. My phone got red hot. So I tried it on my iPad. It drained the battery completely; unfortunately even while on charge. Had to delete it. Shame. I wanted to help....<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:45:36__

> Update : it is chaos<br> :date: __2020-12-17 03:12:18__

> Haven't a clue what is it<br> :date: __2020-12-07 18:42:59__

> I'm sorry. I wanted to help. But my phone won't charge. It drains faster than it charging. After 1 hour it got from 86% to 80% while plugged in. It's a Samsung S7 with a fast charger. You might want to look into this.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 14:13:42__

> This app used to work perfectly but now refuses to work at all. It just claims that I've reached my data limit for the month despite the fact that I'm using WiFi. I have tried deleting it and reinstalling it several times but it still doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:21:34__

> Used to be great but now everytime I charge my phone the app crashes<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:32:30__

> I used to love this app but something in the most recent updates has been causing the phone's temp to rise and it keeps having to take a break. It never used to do that and it's to the point where the phone is hot to touch when it runs and this is when there are no other apps running in the background.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:09:32__

> Worked well for the first day, then crashed constantly every night/ charge following. Made the phone almost impossible to use prior to uninstalling due to all the crashes occurring.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:07:07__

> Idea itself is worthwhile, however after a few days the app will stop working or crash when you plug in the power. No support, no replies to messages. Constantly requires uninstalling and install if you want to continue supporting the projects, however your history/contributions are erased.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 23:10:19__
