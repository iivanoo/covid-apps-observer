### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great idea<br> :date: __2021-04-15 23:10:32__

> A great opportunity to help with the scientific world community to find cures and the most accurate medical treatments for cancer and covid. So easy to help, just charge your phone and connect to the Dreamlab app.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 12:34:00__

> Fantastic way to support research!<br> :date: __2021-04-15 09:05:59__

> This app is great because it helps vital research and only activates when your phone is charging so you hardly notice it<br> :date: __2021-04-14 10:51:37__

> Enjoying helping others while my phone charges up!! There should b more charity help apps.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:03:46__

> What can I say....your helping someone in the world at no loss to yourself....can't beat that!<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:24:34__

> Its unobtrusive, works automatically while its being charged, You just install it and forget and your phone does good things for humanity while its on charge. It even will powerdown or temporarily stop if the battery gets even slightly warm. Its a really seamless and considerate app. It only uses background and unused processing power so i dont even notice a slowdown while its working. I highly recommend helping humanity out by installing this.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 21:06:41__

> Great app.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 18:37:39__

> Just works no problems<br> :date: __2021-04-11 11:38:46__

> Fantastic idea and use of spare computing capacity, for great causes. Much needed! Minus 1 star, because the app keeps changing from Corona Phase 3 to Demystify. It should continue with my chosen project every time I plug in!<br> :date: __2021-04-15 03:45:17__

> I have used this for a while now. Curently supporting Imperial College it runs for over a hour but complets 0 calculations.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 17:14:29__

> I sometimes forget it's there, since it runs in the background. Is simple, and great premise. Help cure diseases by simply plugging in your phone. The one nitpick I have with it, is if I optimize my phone with the Device Care, I will have to open the app manually next time to get it to work. After that one time, I do t have to touch it again until the next optimization.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 19:24:48__

> Dreamlab works fine on Galaxy tab no overheating no problem no worries can leave on all day better still if worked without having to be on charge all the time thank you can you please fix this please Vodafone now working on Galaxy A50 fine 🙂 🥰😆<br> :date: __2021-03-25 23:23:18__

> Works away on my phone overright while charging. If, as occassionally happens the phone gets too hot, it takes a break till the phone cools down. Good for me<br> :date: __2021-03-22 12:32:11__

> This app is a fantastic idea, but I wish it would start automatically, rather than replying on me switching it on each night. Sadly, I often forget.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 18:20:01__

> a great way to help the fight when you can't donate money or time. Love the idea of the app, only problem is that the app doesn't always automatically turn on when on charge and hits 80%.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 13:56:20__

> Great easy to forget to bturn on<br> :date: __2021-03-18 12:53:43__

> Giving something back to Society! Especially with this lethal virus!!<br> :date: __2021-03-11 21:58:28__

> Love this app. It works at night while the phone is being charged so it doesn't interfere with anything and at the same time you are helping cancer research. What more could you want.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 00:41:27__

> Is it still worth it to support the Covid 19 stages? With the vaccines, do we even need to support these projects? Oh well I will still support but I guess my patience is wearing off. Edit : my covid-19 calculations keep stopping. No idea why.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 05:14:59__

> Been supporting the Covid-ai project for some time. No one explains how many stages are planned and stage 3 had those awkward 1 hr long calculations. No wonder Stage 4 only has 6.02% and 29k+ users, across 16 days. If there's even a Stage 5, don't expect much participance.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 17:28:48__

> Getting worse. Great premise, but the app is unreliable. Being greeted by a notification saying " well done you powered this for 7 and a half hours and completed zero calculations" makes you wonder what the point is. It used to be much more reliable.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 11:56:46__

> A really good app, shame it doesn't run all the time, using less power and slower processing when not in charge. Not keeping track of overall progress on Samsung S10. I have to clear everything to see how much progress has been made. Reported a while ago but still not fixed<br> :date: __2021-04-03 07:55:06__

> Em L. Ioukk ka. Kaivva ae tae, kkmL<br> :date: __2021-03-31 14:09:42__

> Great idea but the app is not open source, would be great to see it in github and let this app driven by the community<br> :date: __2021-03-25 11:56:00__

> Because politicians have used certain issues inappropriately, there are certain analyses I do not wish to participate in. Over time this application automatically switches away from analyses I feel are more important to those which are more politically appraised.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 17:47:10__

> Good app with great intentions. The problem is that the program I chose keeps getting switched for another program which I do not wish to support. All. Trying to do is support coronavirus research and the app keeps trying to make me support hyperfoods which is suspiciously run in the UK. Stop switching it automatically.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 00:48:21__

> Presumably im helping. Boinc is better. Give more feedback on how we are helping. Also gridcoin being an additional bonus that potentially may have value in the far future. Why bother with this? It is nice if you are not very technical or dont want to fall into the rabbit hole of the many different sciences connected to boinc. If you want no hassle just do this. But if I want more meaningful results I use other platforms. I just need more feedback I guess. This platform is "ok" at least.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 14:06:45__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-02-24 19:10:42__

> Was great, now causing issues. Now causing my phone to overheat and not charge above 86%<br> :date: __2021-03-30 08:52:27__

> I was so excited to contribute to a worthy cause, but it makes my phone unusable when charging. It just needs to have some more settings.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 18:17:45__

> App doesn't start up when plugged in, even on manual start, just keeps saying data will restart the following month, even though setting is for wifi.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 02:00:52__

> What's the reason for rarely updating users on progress % of research project? It's really irritating to dedicate hours of your devices power for weeks and still not see the percentage budge.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 08:51:42__

> Needs more settings. 1. Pause if screen is on. 2. Max processor %. 3. Min % battery to begin processing. For some reason the jobs become stuck with no processing occuring while clock continues - maybe a download issue, it doesn't retry though. Needs a % & time counter per job counter so we can see if it's stuck or just a long job. Phone also slows when it's processing, the % processor option may help with this. Update: now it says Ive reached my monthly data limit which I can't increase over 1gb<br> :date: __2021-02-27 00:17:45__

> You are trying to download the free ringtones for my phone but it won't let you<br> :date: __2021-02-20 06:33:56__

> Not working all the time<br> :date: __2021-01-30 13:13:44__

> Unfortunately after consistant use of the app for a worthy cause, the battery life on my new Samsing S10 no longer lasts day even with minimal interaction. Will have to purchase a new phone.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 19:30:38__

> use this on my work phone (moto) and a tablet with no issues, vut in my Samsung S7 it causes the phone to get really hot. Can you develop a way to select running at half speed or even less. I don't like the idea of heat cycling my phone every night.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 18:06:32__

> Doesn't show right progress, after every few deletes requires reinstall for knowing progress.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:22:12__

> Very annoying and intrussive, unwanted marketing headache for those of us who don't want to be looking dozens of times to the same undesired advertisement.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 23:22:33__

> App need update. It is not working well. Users posted many good ideas. Unfortunately no reaction from devs<br> :date: __2021-04-11 18:03:08__

> It causes my phone to dangerously overheat<br> :date: __2021-03-30 22:36:39__

> Earlier it took about 7 minutes to complete a calc. But now even after 40 minutes 0 calculations are done. When I keave the phone for overnight calculations it only did 5 calculations in 8 hours. Is it the calculations are getting complex or there is something wrong with the app<br> :date: __2021-03-22 18:10:14__

> Great idea, app badly done. We do free work for the company, but the app isn't FOSS. There is no option to disable dreamlab, sometimes I just want to charge my phone and not run the app. It frequently gets stuck on 1 job and doesn't do anything all night. Finally it needs a way to disable Amber alerts so I can sleep and run dreamlab without being awoken by gov.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 04:16:27__

> Used it for a few years. Was a good app. Then for 2 months in a row it claimed I'd used all my data allocation on the first day. Uninstalled and reinstalled and was considered a new user.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 12:20:49__

> Stop and start, changes what youve sekected rubbish<br> :date: __2021-02-26 01:19:42__

> This app will damage your phone's battery. I've been using it for months now but have steadily noticed that my phone is not lasting a full day anymore, initially blamed my usage but it was suggested to me that the app may be the cause. I checked in with others who I encouraged to also download this app and they have had the same issue. I uninstalled several days ago and my battery life has not improved so it appears to be permanent. I now feel responsible for damaging mine and my friends phones.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 11:29:24__

> After having used this app religiously for many years without any problems. They now change your selected project to coronavirus against your will or knowledge. It doesn't matter what project you select. They will secretly change it to coronavirus. I have now deleted this app as I find it unethical.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 04:35:19__

> Good concept. My problem is that it kicks in whenever the phone is charging, not desirable when plugged into a powerbank. I use my phone as cycling computer and also with maps and use a powerbank so i can have the screen on all the time. If dreamlabs kicks in it drains the powerbank and phone battery at an amazing rate. It would help if it was possible to define the time period when dreamlab is active so it is restricted to overnight charging time. Running too often when not wanted so uninstall<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:26:03__
