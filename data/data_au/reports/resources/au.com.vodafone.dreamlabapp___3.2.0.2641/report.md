### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Nice job!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-16 11:13:27__

> In support with vodafone mobile provider helping to crunch data whilst charging your mobile. All for a good cause and free of charge to you. It helps toward new research like Covid, Cancer and scientific research. Options to change anytime. Lots of info on things they are doing and what you have contributed too. Now that's good in my book👍🏽😊<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:17:23__

> It's good to see the projects progressing daily and to receive details when completed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 13:24:31__

> a great app that allows everybody around the world to contribute to the treatment of serious diseases. the only problems I have noticed so far are the following : 1. the research projects receive plenty of calculations at the beginning of each project and until the 10% ; from that point on, more time is required for less calculations. 2. when one stops charging the app for some time and starts again the charging, the latter should continue from the time it had stopped before the break.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:47:30__

> Brilliant idea. I just wish my friends were interested or they haven't told me they are contributing. More advertising is probably needed and it's importance.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 22:40:46__

> Easy to use. Not intrusive. Good cause.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:47:34__

> Very simple, unobtrusive. Hopefully, helping seriously good causes.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 09:09:52__

> I can't believe how easy it is to help these important research projects! I charge my phone overnight, as I have always done, and the app runs off my WiFi in the background. I love seeing in the morning how many calculations my phone has crunched while I've been asleep!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 08:15:21__

> Nice app<br> :date: __2021-01-13 03:50:52__

> Easy to use, just charge you're device to help.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 16:02:47__

> The job it does is fantastic. I'm not convinced it releases resources properly after charging as my battery runs down faster than expected after use...<br> :date: __2021-01-15 17:54:09__

> Great idea but it seems to run for 15-60 minutes and then switches off and so wasting most of the night's available processing time, so only 4 stars<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:40:38__

> Good to put this bit of tech to use. Sometimes won't record any calculations as being done despite 9 hours on. Is it because it started before phone was at 80% battery?<br> :date: __2021-01-11 01:52:47__

> Not much to say apart that I hope I am providing a useful service to research<br> :date: __2021-01-10 02:49:47__

> Works away in the background without fuss. Nice to be able to contribute<br> :date: __2021-01-09 09:09:13__

> Once set up, this is simple to use. You must be on an unlimited tariff and wifi to make the most of it. Make sure you set the app to operate only when charging, then it is no hassle to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 11:16:02__

> Dreamlab works fine on Galaxy tab no overheating no problem no worries can leave on all day better still if worked without having to be on charge all the time thank you can you please fix this please Vodafone<br> :date: __2021-01-07 12:09:53__

> Great idea. Could use improvements to encourage more users.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 09:17:07__

> Took a while to get used to it, phone needs to be fully charged for best use otherwise battery drains rapidly. Very happy to help science.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:04:10__

> Good, but should be better. It says in the app, that you can use this just on battery when not charging - you can't. If you could I'd give it 5 stars. Otherwise fab app where you can help solve major issues and possibly help save lives. It hasn't affected my battery yet after 40 hours use.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 08:14:30__

> A great idea this but it does not automatically start calculations when I put my phone on charge. I have to manually start the calculations - it's rare I think to do so. There should be an in-app setting to allow automatic start upon plug in. 1 star lost because it's missing this obvious function. 1 star lost because without this function, the app is simply a waste of memory on my phone. Fix this and it's 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 18:53:46__

> Very nice app, however, I wish it has I control when the app starts crunching numbers, for example after my battery level is up to 99% for example and it will stop if the battery drops Below 90% and so on.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 14:54:10__

> Good concept. My problem is that it kicks in whenever the phone is charging, not desirable when plugged into a powerbank. I use my phone as cycling computer and also with maps and use a powerbank so i can have the screen on all the time. If dreamlabs kicks in it drains the powerbank and phone battery at an amazing rate. It would help if it was possible to define the time period when dreamlab is active so it is restricted to overnight charging time.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 09:22:17__

> Needs a progress bar/% as while some jobs take several minutes, others go on for hours and it's not clear if it's frozen or not. 12 calculations over 10hrs on a snapdragon 865?Needs an option to suspend processing if screen is on. On some phones it's using more power than its charging so battery goes down, therefore needs an option to reduce processor % to counter this + % battery required before activating. You guys definitely need to take a few leaves out of boincs book. Poco F2 pro android 11<br> :date: __2021-01-07 13:56:27__

> Not as configurable as BOINC eg scheduling work. Too many thumb's up notifications. Can't adjust CPU usage.<br> :date: __2020-12-29 18:08:25__

> Good app but settings are severely lacking, no way of telling it when to run and when not to run. I'd like to be able to customise when to start a session and also why can't it be used without being plugged in? Surely using less CPU when it's not plugged in is better than not running at all? I'd also like to see it automatically start instead of needing me to go into the app and tapping start session.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:40:48__

> Great idea... But app needs more controls to limit cpu and send it can run<br> :date: __2020-12-14 11:23:42__

> I'd like to use this on my phone but it eats power faster than the wireless charger can charge it. The phone charges up to 80%, the app starts calculating, next thing I know despite the phone still being on the charger the battery has 70% in it and still falling. The app needs to check the charge level when it is running and avoid allowing the phone to be depleted if the phone is using more power than it is getting from the charger.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 17:38:48__

> It is a worthwhile app, however I find if it stops due to battery temp, it doesn't automatically restart, which is not so good as I find I may only gain 15 or 20 mins running each night..<br> :date: __2020-12-10 00:04:38__

> I am on Vodafone with unlimited Max, or whatever it is called.. Around 4 months ago, the app, or Vodafone seem to have applied a 500mg per month limit to the data usage, consequently, after the first week of the month, this app remains idle! Vodafone weren't much help, other than confirming the 500mg cap exists. Not happy.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 14:25:48__

> use this on my work phone (moto) and a tablet with no issues, vut in my Samsung S7 it causes the phone to get really hot. Can you develop a way to select running at half speed or even less. I don't like the idea of heat cycling my phone every night.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 18:06:32__

> Doesn't show right progress, after every few deletes requires reinstall for knowing progress.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:22:12__

> It just won't stay running.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:36:07__

> Great idea, was excited to help but the app always crashes. Have turned it on every night for over a week and there hasn't been a single morning the app was still running and only clocked up 5 hours<br> :date: __2020-12-30 14:06:28__

> Stops calculating when charged but still plugged in, doesn't automatically start. Fix please!<br> :date: __2020-12-25 14:24:10__

> Uninstalled. Great idea, but too power intensive. Left the phone on charge over night and the battery only gained 2%.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:34:19__

> Nice concept like SETI@Home but T+C are suspect. They say accuracy of data sent by vodaphone isn't guaranteed. Yes this is probably template language but it says what it says. No point in burning power on inaccurate info for calculations. Also couldn't find info on project vetting, how do I know I'm not doing someone's Bitcoin mining? Will reinstall when T+C specific to project is available and vetting info publicised<br> :date: __2020-12-04 23:43:14__

> Insgesamt natürlich eine wichtige und wertvolle Idee, die App an sich hat aber noch Luft nach oben. Vorschläge: 1. Eine Option die Berechnungen erst ab einem gewissen Ladestand des Akkus zu starten. 2. Ein besseres Tracking der eigenen Beiträge, evtl. userbasiert und mit Highscore Listen (wie z.B. bei Folding) über mehrere Geräte hinweg, das motiviert zusätzlich. 3. Aktuell kaum nutzbar wenn man sein Smartphone per Schnellladefunktion lädt, weil es zu heiß wird. Hier muss nachgebessert werden.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 14:52:04__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'take a break' to cool down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again. Pixel 4 XL<br> :date: __2020-11-30 15:08:41__

> Worked for about 3 days. After that, the app keeps crashing. Reinstall helped just for the first use. Now keeps crashing down again. Pity<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:12:55__

> it seems that i cant use this for my current phone as it keeps overheating and pauses. my iphone seems to be doing a better job about 30 minutes in without pausing. On my android it pauses every 5 minutes or so. since i am not using my iphone so i will run it there. maybe my Android phone isnt good enough<br> :date: __2021-01-02 08:09:06__
