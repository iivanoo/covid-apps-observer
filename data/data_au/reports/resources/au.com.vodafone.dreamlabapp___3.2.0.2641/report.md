### Description
> ***Temporarily, DreamLab is being used to support research to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19).***
<br>Imagine if we could speed up time in the fight against cancer.
<br> 
<br>DreamLab is a multi-award winning app that uses the collective power of smartphones to fast track cancer research. With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.
<br>HOW IT WORKS
<br>Researchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.
<br>We’ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you – with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. 
<br>Simply download the app (#) and choose which Project you’d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you’ve made and keep up to date with News.
<br>Dreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.
<br>* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.
<br># By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not download, install or otherwise use DreamLab Application.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Vodafone Foundation |
| **Website**  | [http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab](http://www.vodafone.com.au/dreamlab) |
| **Email** | dreamlab@vodafone.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | [Vodafone Foundation, 1 Kingdom Street, London, W2 6BY United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Vodafone%20Foundation,%201%20Kingdom%20Street,%20London,%20W2%206BY%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vodafone+Foundation) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> An Excellent application and idea. This application should be used anywhere in the world.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 11:04:38__

> Dreamlab is an app that can make a real difference, if you have unlimited or unused data each month, put it to good use. Lets solve the problems that matter, together.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 22:28:30__

> Fantastic idea, I use folding on my PC for the same thing and it's good to know it's going to use for something.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 09:26:24__

> Works well, device doesn't overheat. I like it! \*\*\*\** I run it on tablet Amazon Fire HD8, it processes about two COVID-19 tasks each hour. DreamLab application is not in Amazon Store so it is tricky to install it to the Amazon tablet. \*\*\*\** The best device to run DreamLab is Amazon Fire TV 4k stick. It is small, it runs cool and it calculates 2 tasks each hour. DreamLab was not designed for Amazon Fire TV and it doesn't look nice at Fire TV but it works hard and solves about 50 COVID-19 tasks each day. My TV stick was idle most of the time, DreamLab keeps it busy 24/7. It is not easy to install DreamLab to Amazon Fire TV but experienced user can do it (be creative, try any trick you know ;-) \*\*\*\** There is small problem when DreamLab runs on Android TV box connected to internet over Ethernet cable. DreamLab doesn't like Ethernet cable and reports that device is not connected to the Internet and it doesn't work on tasks. Connect over WiFi and DreamLab will start processing tasks. The same applies for DreamLab running at Android on ODROID-C2 computer, use WiFi USB dongle... \*\*\*\** I tried several other Android TV boxes but many of them report high temperature (temperature of battery?) and DreamLab in that case is paused and it waits until device cools down. I think this is a problem of these devices because they have no battery but report that battery is hot. One of such device is ASUS Tinkerboard computer, DreamLab doesn't like that the device is "hot". Similar problem is with new Amazon FireTV Lite stick, it reports it has no battery and that battery is charged at 0% and DreamLab waits idle till battery is charged. What a pity, Amazon FireTV Lite stick has similar performance like FireTV 4K (that can solve about 50 COVID tasks each day) but it is cheaper.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 12:50:28__

> Just works on wifi when I'm asleep and phone is charging.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 14:51:36__

> This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded. It's a brainstrorm! Thanks for letting us chip in with our little grain of salt!<br> :date: __2020-11-24 04:13:42__

> The app seems to be well designed, I just like the idea that when my phone is charging it computing power is helping cure diseases for free over WiFi.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:10:34__

> No ads, no issues, no impact on my other apps, and doing something good for the world. Love it!<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:46:04__

> Brilliant. Could do with an auto run option as I I forget to start it<br> :date: __2020-11-22 23:39:03__

> It has recently stopped working while my phone is being charged and can't be used when not charging so is stuck in a rut. Still one of the best uses of idle phones I've ever heard of though. Edit: the only project I'm allowed to work on is the Coronavirus one! What a genuinely good use of a million idle devices.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 03:07:06__

> App has stopped working since latest update. Just sits at zero all the time whether I'm on Wi-Fi or mobile data. Please fix it.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 00:59:02__

> Only used it a couple nights now and it's working fine on my Android A71. Suggestions: Some way to send info/ad about it to friends. Also an autostart or at least a reminder to start whenever phone is plugged in or at a set-able time every day.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 16:08:09__

> UPDATE: Do notice a bit of slowdown if I try streaming or use badly made websites, but nothing major, and you can always pause it if you notice issues. But below still stands. Runs faultlessly on my Xperia. I normally only have it running when I sleep and it doesn't interfere with my sleep tracking.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 08:08:27__

> It seems to have cleared any bugs. It seizes up in warm weather when the phone is on charge and getting warm, but is a lot better in not so warm weather. And of it helps with the research then it is doing a good job while I am in bed, asleep, at night.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 08:05:08__

> I can only give 4 stars, because the mobile data is limited to 500mb and it seems that in the past 2 months is using those 500mb in 2 weeks, why not giving the option of more data to any user (i have an unlimited data abb on my mobile carier) so that i don't use the wireless in the house...<br> :date: __2020-10-25 21:36:47__

> More frequent updates of the progress of the calculations / project progress would be great to see; but it works well, I don't feel that my mobile gets slower or overheated; and it feels good to contribute, it's really easy!<br> :date: __2020-10-24 01:19:21__

> I'm running this app on a TABLET, please could you try to make this Tablet friendly by allowing Landscape display as well as Portrait mode.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 21:44:39__

> Good but I had to manually clear the data from the app when it finished a project<br> :date: __2020-10-10 22:55:46__

> Ja, gør sikkert det den skal og med et minmum af forstyrrelser :-)<br> :date: __2020-10-04 18:28:07__

> Lovely ui design. Love the app. Reduce memory & storage footprint.RAM consumption seems kinda high. Please make optimisations for 718mb device as well as i keep losing my progress sometimes gets kicked out of memory due to low memory and lost all my calculations. Please try to integrate BOINC projects into it if possible. That would be awesome and all in one app for computational donation/contribution app. Keep up the good work and bless you all that have been involved in this work.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 18:04:08__

> This is a great app, if you're like me and have unlimited data then you can leave overnight to charge and contribute. The only issue I have with this is like many users, there isn't enough advertisement surrounding this so it remains fairly unknown. If this was standard throughout all Vodafone devices and required users to Opt out, then I feel there would be more of a buzz surrounding this.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:59:39__

> I'm unclear exactly how this thing works, and that concerns me a bit It fires up any time I put my phone on the charger... Day or night I am on my home wifi... I have yet to see if it turns on in the car when I plug the charger in... I never use all my data each month but that doesn't mean I want to risk it while driving I was under the impression the app only runs at night (I am in the US, if that matters)... But there is no way to set a schedule that allows it to run only during certain hours<br> :date: __2020-11-16 04:59:26__

> Great idea, but I've got a problem after some hours of use, since it starts crashing just after enabling or even just opening it; both on Android 7 and iPadOs 14<br> :date: __2020-11-15 13:39:57__

> Id like to be able to turn on dreamlab without charging. For example, in my evening routine, b4 I plug my phone. Or when home, walking around with my phone, I'd turn on drmlb. I don't mind if that drains my battery, because I'd be close to a charger anyway. Now it's hard to integrate the task of turning on drmlb into my evening routine since I can only do it when my phone is plugged in. A reminder to turn on dreamlab when plugging in would b helpful as well. Or drmlb would turn on automaticlly?<br> :date: __2020-10-29 07:51:26__

> Installed without my knowledge. Vodafone is now into bloatware. Regardless of the good intentions and I know that they are good, you should be given the option to opt in. I found out about it when I started getting notifications about an App I knew nothing about<br> :date: __2020-10-27 19:27:45__

> Simple app. Great idea. Waste of time if you're not even to advertise the thing. This should be am opt out app on every person's phone me. You should be on Facebook hammering this out to everyone. It feels like a box you guys have ticked, so you can talk about it at dinner parties. The potential of this thing could cure some major problems, use it.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 10:10:48__

> I'm disappointed that I can't contribute more data because I'm with Telstra and not Vodafone. If we can help find a cure for cancer it will help save lives of people will this horrible disease. My 14 year old great nephew died in June from a brain tumour, it only took 10 months from diagnosis to kill him. We need to stop cancer from killing our love ones.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 07:13:53__

> Problems on Note20 Ultra. Force closing constantly. Had to uninstall after a few days working OK.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 19:48:38__

> Please allow us to set "unlimited data" for mobile data use. 500MB allowance is reached after one night of calculations on my phone. As well I have experienced crashes after having a large amount of calculations completed causing me to reset the app in order to use it.<br> :date: __2020-10-20 16:12:41__

> The app desperately needs settings. It has virtually none. It's a great purpose but wasted. I plug my phone in to charge every night and always forget to switch it on. Should be a auto start or scheduled or a reminder when plugging in.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 17:47:50__

> Is there a way to set a timer so it will download between certain times for example to only work at night time? There are certain times during the day where I want to charge my phone and without telling me it will run in the background which slows the charging process. Gets annoying when I realise it's been running in the background and when I want to turn it off I can't because it needs to 'cool' down which I am unable to stop the process until it starts again. Pixel 4 XL<br> :date: __2020-11-30 05:36:15__

> Worked for about 3 days. After that, the app keeps crashing. Reinstall helped just for the first use. Now keeps crashing down again. Pity<br> :date: __2020-11-25 23:12:55__

> Having to uninstall as phone runs way too hot when this is running<br> :date: __2020-11-24 12:29:49__

> The idea is nice, but it drains the battery instead of having settings to work only when charging and from some battery percentage. EDIT: You say that it works only when charging, but there is no indication for it. Please update the app to show it. Also please have settings, to disallow it being used when below some percentage (I want it to stop when below 95% for example).<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:34:48__

> This app should have an option to work at 50% or even less of the processing power while not charging my phone. It doesn't really make sense when most smartphones have an ultra fast charging and doesn't need to be charged overnight. EDIT: App stopped working and doesn't do any calculations anymore...<br> :date: __2020-10-31 22:27:03__

> Interesting idea but still having issues with the app crashing.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 15:54:04__

> I'm having a lot of technical difficulties with this app quite recently. I've had to uninstall the app 4 times, and install again just to get it to work properly. Apart from that, I love this app. Please fix this problem. Thank you.<br> :date: __2020-10-04 15:11:35__

> Good app, with a nice idea. However, causes my OnePlus 6T to overheat and stops calculating<br> :date: __2020-09-19 09:37:27__

> Needs a scheduling setting so you can control charging versus number crunching.<br> :date: __2020-09-01 12:11:38__

> So wanted to like this. I almost exclusively wireless charge. I've had a lot of instances of the app not starting whilst charging and now twice it's continued operation after taking my phone off the charger and I've woken up in the morning to 4% battery.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 03:14:58__

> Used to be great but now everytime I charge my phone the app crashes<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:32:30__

> I used to love this app but something in the most recent updates has been causing the phone's temp to rise and it keeps having to take a break. It never used to do that and it's to the point where the phone is hot to touch when it runs and this is when there are no other apps running in the background.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:09:32__

> Worked well for the first day, then crashed constantly every night/ charge following. Made the phone almost impossible to use prior to uninstalling due to all the crashes occurring.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 16:07:07__

> Idea itself is worthwhile, however after a few days the app will stop working or crash when you plug in the power. No support, no replies to messages. Constantly requires uninstalling and install if you want to continue supporting the projects, however your history/contributions are erased.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 23:10:19__

> Does not automatically start when power plugged in. Missed out on months of potential calculations.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 21:31:21__

> Does not connect when it should - what a waste!<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:02:44__

> Normally amazing, but wont work now keeps crashing:/ all it does is crash constantly.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 05:16:10__

> For over a year I have been using two phones to power Dreamlab. The app is crashing on both phones. The app is updated automatically on Samsung and Motorola phones. No feedback from dreamlab whatsoever. Regrettably, uninstalled on both phones 😭<br> :date: __2020-11-10 00:30:07__

> Great idea but when the app keeps on crashing and cause problems on multiple phones you lose the will to help and uninstall the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 23:56:45__

> The app keeps crashing. I uninstalled and reinstalled many times. After reinstall it works till the next time I unplug the power. When I resume, it starts crashing. Please address the issue.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 11:08:31__
