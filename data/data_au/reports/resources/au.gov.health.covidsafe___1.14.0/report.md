### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Update Nov 2020: Uninstalled due to battery drain and overheating on a Galaxy S10 5G. Too risky to leave installed. No issues on Galaxy A30. Down to 4 stars. Original Review: Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers. Original review 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 00:34:25__

> It is extremely good, people need to know how to protect themselves from this coronavirus.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 07:13:23__

> I don't mind if it runs in the background, just let me hide the persistent notification. I don't need it to tell me it's running, I've already accepted the terms and agree to all the permissions.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 02:23:07__

> How can this app be using more than 41% of my phone's battery??? This is ridiculous<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:14:29__

> I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.<br> :date: __2020-10-30 02:07:56__

> App is not letting Android use GPS location all the time. Without this, the app is useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 04:04:42__

> Doesn't seem to work that well with tracing according to all reports Already registered so why would I bother to update is the new version only fix registration issue??!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 08:26:18__

> Pretty useless<br> :date: __2020-11-21 07:17:54__

> Further improvement needed to minimise drainage of battery. The app is on 24/7 in the background to constantly check whether it is active. I need not to turn it on while inside my home to safe on battery power. Areas for improvement - have a button to turn the app on or off to save battery power - disable the function to constantly checking whether it is active<br> :date: __2020-11-20 22:24:11__

> Something need to be done to improve this Apps as it goes to inactive by itself without warning and need my constant awareness to check whether it is still active with the green icon. It just defeats the purpose if it does not works as it required to.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 07:45:17__

> does not do anything. cannot drilldown into the state's info. would not work with battery optimisation. drains battery very fast.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 23:19:16__

> Operates ok but not uncommon, to stop working. All settings correct on Note10+ but constantly getting warning that app has stopped working.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 08:20:54__

> A total power hog. Uses more power than any other app. I contacted the app help and got some crappy automated response. Still eating battery.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 13:38:53__

> Recent updates have screwed with Bluetooth settings on other devices, eg smartwatch, BP monitor. To get them working again had to uninstall and reinstall app...<br> :date: __2020-11-30 02:09:11__

> Significant battery drain as app need to disable battery optimisation operating 24/7. Need to utilise an option where app is on only when outside of home if battery optimisation needs to be disabled to work.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 01:37:00__

> Useless and expensive garbage that doesn't work.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 22:02:52__

> Great idea but terrible implementation. Runs constantly in the background with no way to turn it off when you are just at home and don't need it, only option is to uninstall. By default has a persistent notification to tell you whether it's working which is annoying.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 12:41:00__

> While I think this app was a good idea, I have had to uninstall it due to battery drainage. I would probably reinstall it if we have another outbreak<br> :date: __2020-11-28 11:58:27__

> Having the same problem described below. I own an OPPO phone and constantly get messages about disabling battery optimisation. I do so and within a few hours get another message. I'm sick of maintaining it. Fix it or I'll remove it and take my chances. I haven't yet seen any stats as to the success of the app in doing the job it's designed for. Unlikely if others are having the same issues.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 19:54:14__

> App always off even though all battery optimisation options are off<br> :date: __2020-11-27 07:46:02__

> Irresponsible that qr code check-in has not been implemented. Australians are losing their private data to third parties. The government needs to step up, and protect the privacy of Australians, and provide a safer means to qr code check-in.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 06:01:15__
