### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Update Nov 2020: Uninstalled due to battery drain and overheating on a Galaxy S10 5G. Too risky to leave installed. No issues on Galaxy A30. Down to 4 stars. Original Review: Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers.

> Its a battery drain maybe since last update? I can have a full battery at 2pm then 20% at 4pm when my phone has done nothing. This app is the only one listed as any significant battery drain. Never used to be this way but I have to keep it off. Don't like travelling home at night with no phone.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 14:54:01__

> My android app refuses to download the current state of covid cases. I have to go to Google to find out. It is annoying and frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-04 21:20:54__

> Doesn't really do anything.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 03:47:26__

> After 6 months have uninstalled, the decision to move to the untried Herald protocol was the last straw.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 00:16:40__

> Have an OPPO phone and tired of "correcting" battery optimisation. Will likely delete it if is not remedied.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 02:36:14__

> It's doesn't work I got close to some one who has it<br> :date: __2020-11-29 01:01:51__

> App is not letting Android use GPS location all the time. Without this, the app is useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 04:04:42__

> Doesn't seem to work that well with tracing according to all reports Already registered so why would I bother to update is the new version only fix registration issue??!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 08:26:18__

> Pretty useless<br> :date: __2020-11-21 07:17:54__

> Further improvement needed to minimise drainage of battery. The app is on 24/7 in the background to constantly check whether it is active. I need not to turn it on while inside my home to safe on battery power. Areas for improvement - have a button to turn the app on or off to save battery power - disable the function to constantly checking whether it is active<br> :date: __2020-11-20 22:24:11__

> App contains 13 thousand cases of battery drainage , I tried getting a mask for my oppo phone but it still didn't fix the problem # uninstalled.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 09:27:31__

> Cant install. Doesnt recognise my mobile number. Absolute joke.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 08:53:54__

> App not active unless battery optimization is disabled. Unfortunately my phone turns optimization back on again every time I disabled it. It should be "set and forget" instead of having to do this every time I am going out. No good as it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 08:01:34__

> Uses a stupid amount of battery<br> :date: __2020-12-13 02:14:22__

> Massive battery drain on my new Galaxy S10 5G. Uninstalled, battery usage back to normal (had it installed for a week or so prior to the 5 Nov update with no issues, battery issues began after that update).<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:35:47__

> Does not work on opposite phone when it says active you need to fix this<br> :date: __2020-12-08 06:48:38__

> Nothing wrong with oppo phones. Your oppo is protecting your information and phone processes. This app is invasive and shouldn't rely on 24/7 access. Taking the QR code photo should be suffice. Seems like the government doesn't trust us to do the right thing.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 12:07:26__
