## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> 3 hours to try and down load the app and it times out. Have tried over 4 days and it still wont download.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 01:59:06__

> The app freezes when I access my driver's licence. This is a new development over the last week or so. Running Pixel 3a with latest operating system and app is up to date.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 00:02:56__

> This app doesn't recognise my email address. I have an account with RMS. It wouldn't recognise my password. It all started trying to get a mobile app for sighning in for covid with my camera<br> :date: __2020-10-20 03:35:39__

> Unable to scan my fingerprint. Doesn't appear to be working?<br> :date: __2020-10-19 02:20:04__

> Very good 😊<br> :date: __2020-10-10 05:17:55__

> No way in if you forgot your password. It sends you a one time code but that opens and logs you in on the web. When you switch back to the app you're still logged out. Frustrating<br> :date: __2020-09-11 13:06:28__

> Memory hog, big time.<br> :date: __2020-08-30 01:24:23__

> Ridiculous as it doesnt work on rooted phones. I have my banking app which works on my phone which I really should be concerned more about of it's security leaks than your frustrating app! So next time when you push an update please disable "root check".<br> :date: __2020-07-26 13:06:33__

> Why is it that you can send a push to tell me that I'm not allowed over the border for covid but you can't push notifications to suggest that there is an expiring registration or a traffic infringement or anything that is important and time critical?<br> :date: __2020-07-23 07:47:39__

> Does not always work. Even standing in RMS.😐<br> :date: __2020-07-15 13:45:36__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="au.gov.nsw.service 1 reviews"/>
</p>

> Minus 50 stars. Need digital drivers licence so car rental company can see my licence is valid. Make several attempts over 3 days to reset my password. I don't receive a single Email. I phone and hold 20 minutes for no answer. Branch then tells me after queuing to visit that "The system is down". System is beyond broken.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 03:25:09__

> Many venues are not using your QR print out..<br> :date: __2020-11-15 23:54:23__

> Crashes all the time, especially when filling in important information.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:33:41__

> Like everything our government does this app is absolutely useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 20:45:31__

> Crashes on start up. When it works can't do anything anyway as it says my system is rooted and won't work for my security. My phone is rooted for my security!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 00:49:07__

> Not surprising that a gotv app fails. Try to covid check in. At best doesn't remember my details (when logged in) at worst - something went wrong.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 23:26:58__

> Difficulties downloading app on Google Play.<br> :date: __2020-11-12 01:48:04__

> Checking for Safety Net is security theatre. A phone that does not pass safetynet now cannot scan serviceNSW's contact tracing qr codes and legally you have to then be denied entry to the business you wanted to enter.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 10:42:58__

> Forgot password so when I try to retrieve it it sends me to another page saying I'm missing a certificate then I can't go any further<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:03:44__

> App itself is good BUT BIG BUT it doesn't work with older versions of Android so is unusable for many people. Major fail.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 12:47:40__
