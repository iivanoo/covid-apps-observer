## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A well designed app that is easy to navigate. Devs listen to feedback and are reasonably prompt correcting issues. Like dark mode and putting covid sign in at the top of the home page.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:47:04__

> Great app easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-14 07:54:57__

> Yes easy to use app. Beneficial information<br> :date: __2021-04-13 07:13:40__

> *Edit* Issue has now been fixed. Thanks for your swift response.\*\* This App is frustrating. I was able to access it until the covid check ins. Now I can't get into my account. I can log into my account through web access but not through this app. I've used the same credentials to log into the App but it says my password is incorrect. I've reset several times only to realise it's the app that's the issue. Because of this issue, I can't even (Covid) check into any places.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 00:02:10__

> Where do I add my dependants when checking in? Found it 😜<br> :date: __2021-04-13 03:30:50__

> I think this app is great. Fact that I no longer need to panic when cops pull me over cause I forgot my wallet and licence is great. I honestly don't know why anyone's got any negative issues. No trouble signing in or out of anywhere. Could be even better if I could add my Medicare.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 16:58:23__

> Its a good start and nice app/ GUI. Only issue is even though I have enabled covid check out reminder notifications, I am not getting any alerts if forget to checkout even after a week or so<br> :date: __2021-04-08 01:41:00__

> Quick and pretty straight forward to set up<br> :date: __2021-04-07 11:58:49__

> Makes COVID check in faster, otherwise it just redirects you to the website.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 03:05:59__

> No good can't even read finger print. Useless. Can't sign in as app only has 4 spaces for log in and no letters on keyboard. Fingerprint worked on Monday but now won't work. Needs fixing. Ok now the update last week changed the settings. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-04-06 10:15:40__

> To many loops that bring you back to the same place. Extremely difficult to make contact without interogation<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:31:30__

> Slow to update<br> :date: __2021-04-15 01:25:49__

> Only giving it 3 because how long is the photo id for proof of age<br> :date: __2021-04-14 14:10:31__

> If this is the Services NSW app, why can't I read the current value of my senior's travel card or see my Dine and Discover details? Where is my Opel card? It is good for my licence, but when I want to log in to a Covid Safe site it locks up. I don't want to be too critical of someone's effort it providing the information it does provide. Buy really! It does seem to have some serious limitations.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 06:49:43__

> I always get the woman who has a attitude problem. Its Saturday, so why am I here. Bad customer service from Grafton office.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 04:12:12__

> My digital drivers licence will no longer load (appear) in this app. Been an issue for weeks now. How can I rectify. Settings appear all correct.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 04:07:14__

> Issues with checking in to places. Wherever is the first place in the day that I check in for, it will continually keep checking me in to the same place despite me scanning a different QR Code. And before you ask, yes I have the most up-to-date version and yes I have un-installed and then re-installed many times. What's the point if you can't even develop the app to work properly.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 12:18:31__

> bit complicated to maneuver<br> :date: __2021-04-05 11:20:32__

> It was ok<br> :date: __2021-04-03 01:27:54__

> Not that smart. I already have my digital license on the apps for a while but when I select for NSW $100 voucher, still asked me to manually put back my Drivers license details & address. It makes me think for a while that my details are compromised. Also need to provide 1 more documents (e.g. passport, Medicare etc) to claim it. Hope this is a very secure apps.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 21:16:14__

> Can't signin anymore<br> :date: __2021-04-18 07:50:59__

> Was working fine up until today. It's saying that my phone is using "non standard software". I haven't installed or changed anything and was using it just fine the other day.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 10:22:17__

> Does not work<br> :date: __2021-04-06 01:01:25__

> Only works at some shops<br> :date: __2021-04-02 08:34:01__

> Thank you for your response, but what I meant was all the categories are visible, only the bottom half of each category label is visible, they have no top. Why would the app only work properly on a mobile and not a tablet? Android and iOS both operate on mobile phones and tablets. Some tablets can make phone calls. The feedback section does not work on either phone or tablet. Also, it would be nice if the screen could be rotated.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 06:11:01__

> I felt the person I was talking to was not friendly and after waiting for 40 minutes the person hung up on me. Very poor service.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 02:03:00__

> Frustrating, took five goes to get acceptance for the vouchers. I finally got the go ahead & that I would receive a email with the vouchers. I did & was able to download them on the computer, but on the service app. the vouchers do not appear...just says let's get started. Annoying. Will try that site for help<br> :date: __2021-03-29 07:08:50__

> Has worked fine until a few days ago, it has logged me out and says 'incorrect email or password'. I have reset my password, uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous time but nothing fixes the issue. I can log onto the Service NSW website with no problems, so the password is not the problem, it is a glitch with the app<br> :date: __2021-03-27 02:31:31__

> Not letting me login<br> :date: __2021-03-26 02:57:05__

> Painful..i cannot log in. I keep changing my passwords. Still cant log in. Uninstall/reinstall the app like 10 times. Cant scan covid checks.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 09:06:12__

> Not impressed at all so far. Just logging in is a hassle as it tells me I've used the wrong email or password even though I've used the same credentials before. The same thing happens every time so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I was able to log in after that but then I tried to redeem one of the Dine & Discover vouchers today for the first time and when the venue scanned the QR code, it came up as invalid. Not happy Jan<br> :date: __2021-04-17 08:49:11__
