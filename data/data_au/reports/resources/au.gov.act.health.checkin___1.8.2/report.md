## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> EDIT: In response to my previous rating developer explained app had stopped working with earlier versions of Android. They have now fixed it and it's working perfectly so I've upgraded to 5 stars. Has stopped working since last update. Have reinstalled but still crashes.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 03:31:28__

> All fixed now! Make sure you update to allow the app to use the camera. That is what I had to do after reinstalling it.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 08:05:00__

> Update: app is working since v1.8.2 update. Thanks for the quick fix. Update: Installed v1.8.2 and the app now starts up; I will try to check in tomorrow. Thanks for prompt response. Previous: Unable to start app anymore since updated to version 1.8.1, 25 Feb 2021.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 03:23:18__

> Seems to work well.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 11:04:16__

> Yay! You guys fixed the Andoid 8 bug, well done and works again now, brilliant app again.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 08:46:57__

> App now working again.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 09:38:09__

> Works for me üëç<br> :date: __2021-02-28 08:40:06__

> Great idea and was easy to use BUT doesn't work any more on my Samsung after the upgrade on 25th of Feb. A bug must have been introduced.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 20:21:14__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 08:09:10__

> App worked fine on my Moto G5 Android (8.1.0) until a week or so ago, since when it won't even open. I have just downloaded the latest version - no change. Please fix whatever you did to break it EDIT: following update 1.8.2, the app now opens and functions as before. Thanks for taking action, as the 'solution' provided to many people below was really not acceptable in 2021<br> :date: __2021-03-03 06:26:53__

> The app wasn't working since the 25 Feb update, but it was fixed this morning (2 March 2021). At least it now works ok for my Samsung Galaxy S7 android phone.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 12:16:28__

> App working again since update 1/3/2021.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 02:19:18__

> Great app to use! Only have to enter your details once at setup, unlike interstate arrangements. Just a simple click to check in at arrival, no check out required. Just needs more extensive testing before updates are released.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 22:40:12__

> Once loaded this app is easy to use, so much easier than NSW or Vic!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 00:06:07__

> Was easy to install particularly for a tech challenged person. Only issue is that does not allow me to check out unlike the nsw app<br> :date: __2021-02-12 01:47:53__

> App makes check-in easy and I like how it remembers dependents for easy future check-ins. Would be nice if locations you frequented could be remembered and used in the same way for easy repeat check-ins without needing a code or to huddle around a QR code that someone had posted on the wall.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 07:37:19__

> Its missing a checkout button to end ur visit to a place. It needs a time out to ensure correct contact tracing<br> :date: __2020-12-09 02:30:00__

> First try today - so very relieved to have no issues at Restaurant. Guess there's no need to checkout on departure?<br> :date: __2020-12-04 03:55:33__

> Not enough businesses on it. Many still using pen and paper.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 05:00:51__

> What if I do not have internet data? Not everyone has free wifi data which may make the app useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 00:02:46__

> Sometimes app won't open<br> :date: __2021-02-28 00:56:16__

> The graphics are too dark under some lighting.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 01:44:49__

> It works for scanning the QR code. But I can offarhim why do I have to reenter all my personal details everytime I use the app for myself on my phone. The nswservices app handles this very well. Please start considering the user when you write mobile apps. Many miss some simple things that would make many people's lives better. I hatdusing this app.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:04:05__

> Takes ages to open the camera scanner function.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 09:13:41__

> Seems to work ok. Slow to load, requiring data connection to do so. Cannot access QR code scanner without data connection. Suggest allowing access to QR code scanner without needing data connection to allow check in, uploading locations when data becomes available.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 21:58:59__

> Would be better if you could check in by typing name of check-in place, geolocation, or select from previous check-in history.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 01:20:33__

> Works for some places, not others, it just says enter manually code<br> :date: __2020-10-08 23:36:53__

> The App has not changed to daylight savings.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:02:09__

> Why does this get stuck "finding location" now? It used to work reliably.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 09:55:15__

> Does not work on samsung J mini. Screen keeps going blank and won't connect to camera.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 00:32:11__

> Lost this app off my home page - looked at the 'fix failure to load on Android' option but no info given. Okay, now I can't post this at your POST ... Update : found that I had to give stars to be able to post.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 09:02:45__

> Asked me for my credit card why?. Why is not the new south Wales app ok to use.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 04:22:07__

> Slow to load, my history has no check ins, so does it even work? Isn't it supposed to keep a record of where I have checked in?<br> :date: __2021-02-23 02:03:11__

> ACT Health, why do you check in but not check out, like the NSW app? If something does happen you have no idea if a person spent 10 mins or 2 hrs at a place. To stop people forgetting to log out, how bout a popup asking if you are still there 2-3 hrs after checking in if not already logged out?<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:05:59__

> Worked as intended before, but recently has become very slow to load and the qr scanner is not working<br> :date: __2021-01-22 22:29:39__

> Takes to long to download<br> :date: __2020-12-06 04:07:36__

> Doing an upgrade that invalidates all users WITHOUT REPEAT WITHOUT telling anyone is arrogant stupidity from the ACT government. It also shows the contempt that the ACT government has for its citizens. Bringing in $1000 fines right after changing the system is nothing but a money grabbing exercise.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 09:26:15__

> Cant even install<br> :date: __2021-03-05 06:31:58__

> Same peoblem on a Galaxy S6. Not everyone can afford to update their phones guys, especially in a pandemic. Please make sure any updates are compatible!<br> :date: __2021-03-01 22:06:47__

> Apps keeps crashing and unable to start. Reinstalling does not work. Web form back up would be useful in case of the apps crashing all the time like this.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 20:20:12__
