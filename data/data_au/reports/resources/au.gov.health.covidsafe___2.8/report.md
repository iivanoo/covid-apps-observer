### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app but I cannot select Western Australia from main menu.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 04:44:09__

> Simple to install; just set and forget. Doesn't kill the battery, and helps with the fight against COVID-19. Recommended.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 11:01:12__

> What ever it takes.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 23:34:34__

> I don't like wasting battery on constant Bluetooth but I see why it's needed<br> :date: __2021-06-29 00:50:13__

> Would be good if it could cache its operational info if 4G data coverage is not available. With Vodafone this can happen anywhere, any time, it seems but also some places eg Bannister River roadhouse on the Albany Highway, do not have mobile access. Surely it should be possible to store the info and upload it when back within range of a tower?<br> :date: __2021-06-26 17:48:06__

> Seems to work okay for those that do use it .. sadly ignorance is still there so the virus will still spread because of the selfish people who will not use app and expect will not get vaccinated either .. its the way of the people and how we all live now with too many "don't have to do " syndrome which is being taught to our children from a very early age and supported in our education system . Not all the teachers fault they have to do what is set for them . coming right back to bite us now ..<br> :date: __2021-06-26 09:20:52__

> Excellent , sometimes doesn't clear previous contact so you are unable to do your next contact<br> :date: __2021-06-25 08:13:25__

> Excellent as my wife has treatment for cancer each fortnight and it has simplified everything for us.Thank you.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 00:47:32__

> Not up to date with news takes an extra day. Not real time.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 05:05:29__

> Each time I use a q code it logs on recognises the venue and then asks my to install app. Why?<br> :date: __2021-07-02 01:31:51__

> Well it hasn't dion he anything as yet but I hope it will if necessary .<br> :date: __2021-07-01 13:31:39__

> Great idea but I can't keep it active because it drains my battery so fast. So defeats the purpose. Showing the current restrictions in this app is great though, a central place for info.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:43:34__

> Good concept. Would have been better for one system to work for QR codes and live updates for areas. Then the W.A. police said they used it to track someone(Newspaper) not really of much use. Deleted.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 02:38:04__

> Too much battery usage<br> :date: __2021-07-03 09:36:43__

> I'm giving this one more chance, with this update. If it keeps eating my battery it will go. There's no point having an app if I have no battery to power it.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 01:16:54__

> Works (at least I assume that it works) in the background. Doesn't do much. Shows info for all states except for WA!<br> :date: __2021-06-29 01:20:18__

> sucks battery life far too much<br> :date: __2021-06-27 13:13:48__

> Think designed to trigger after 15 mins close contact - should be changed to 15 seconds . 15 minutes in a shopping queue ? It's just wrong .<br> :date: __2021-06-27 08:51:51__

> Almost useless<br> :date: __2021-06-27 07:51:36__

> I still haven't got the Covid scan screen on my phone. It disappeared a few days ago!!!!! How do I get it back on again?<br> :date: __2021-06-27 06:33:09__
