### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, letâ€™s help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the BluetoothÂ® technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact youâ€™ve had with other users by securely logging the other userâ€™s reference code. If you or someone youâ€™ve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and usedâ€”with your consentâ€”by state and territory health officials to quickly inform people whoâ€™ve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>â€¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>â€¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>â€¢ Turn on BluetoothÂ®
<br>â€¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>â€¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If youâ€™ve been exposed to the virus by someone youâ€™ve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> too much power<br> :date: __2021-05-09 12:22:33__

> Was good until battery usage went through the roof.. uninstalled it....<br> :date: __2021-05-04 23:26:14__

> Good so far<br> :date: __2021-05-04 04:34:31__

> Not sure it is working<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:48:40__

> Disappointing. I used this from the word go as I believe it to be a useful tool for its purpose. In the last ?week? or so it has been responsible for massive power drains to the point my phone switched off. The last episode was 70% power usage, yesterday, so unfortunately it is gone.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 01:29:57__

> Ok app, simple to use. Dont like that the camera keeps locking up, so need to close app and try again<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:08:42__

> Sometime difficulty scanning<br> :date: __2021-04-27 10:29:05__

> A failure, due to insufficient uptake! Hey, fools, THIS APP DOES NOT TRACK YOUR MOVEMENTS!! You can easily verify this with Settings/Location/Recent. What's your excuse for not using the app now, you idiots? Also, you can force stop the app when not in use to help prolong battery life...<br> :date: __2021-04-26 11:33:22__

> This version consumes way too much battery. Last night it used half my battery in 7 hours. If this is not fixed, I might have to uninstall it. Edit: the latest version is better on a phone restart, but slowly consumes more battery over time, until it drains most of my battery in a few hours.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 01:50:13__

> Had no issue with this being a background app until it started draining my battery after the last update. Great concept but given that nobody uses this app it's an absolute dud.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 00:33:59__

> Pop down selections for state don't work. You have to hit home go get out, which may of may not work. Don't use device back buttons or you could end up in trouble. Have had the app since in inception so was notified of availability of update, which I did only to get a big red warning flag that my registration had elapsed and I had to step through a bunch of steps to add personal data. Why wasn't I notified separately. Clunky awkward app.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 04:26:03__

> I iPhone to see the money in the bank not it's been 4 years stop dragging<br> :date: __2021-05-01 07:23:23__

> So so a pointless app when you have to use service N.S.W to check in everywhere<br> :date: __2021-04-28 23:02:58__

> The latest update has stuffed up battery usage. I work in a large organisation and 8 hours of background usage chews up 43% of battery of my Samsung Note 9. I literally have to keep my phone plugged all day at work. This needs to be fixed ASAP.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 08:14:42__

> Always when I want to use it....it needs to be updated<br> :date: __2021-04-28 07:00:21__

> Doesn't work on old phones<br> :date: __2021-04-28 01:45:55__

> What does it actually do? Does it even work?<br> :date: __2021-04-24 09:14:11__

> The new update drains my phone battery. I charged before I slept and it went from 100% to 46% overnight. I've removed the app<br> :date: __2021-04-24 07:41:57__

> I up dated this app as requested and it hasnt worked since.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 17:24:28__

> Massive battery drain. Only 8 hrs after taking it off charge, battery usage shows 59.8% to the COVIDSafe app, draining it down to 23%. Whatever changes the last update made has made this app useless. And it still disrupts streaming music via Bluetooth. 8/5/21 App still drains a huge amount of battery life. Sitting at home, app shows battery usage 65%, after 8 hours off charge and drained my battery to 1%. Absolutely shocking usage for just sitting on my desk doing nothing.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 12:23:19__

> Mmm<br> :date: __2021-05-08 10:10:29__

> Waste of money<br> :date: __2021-05-08 09:13:43__

> Waste of effort<br> :date: __2021-05-08 05:59:30__

> The battery drain is just too much. Just running in the background while I sleep it's used over 20%. There's been enough time to address the problem, not putting up with it any more and I don't really have the time to charge my phone several times a day! Also given that we're actually signing in everywhere in addition to this... seems a bit pointless. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 01:48:45__

> Please resolve battery drainage issues - app now uses 28% of my battery in a day.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 01:40:52__

> The results speak for themselves how many cases has this app solved.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 00:15:18__

> Uninstalled due to high battery use, again.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 14:39:53__

> 24 hours behind<br> :date: __2021-05-07 10:41:56__
