### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Turn it on when I leave the house. Can't have it on at home because partner also has his turned on and it kills my battery constantly connecting the two of us. Turning it off means I cant use anything that needs bluetooth. Should be able to tell it when your home and to stop connecting with someone else in your home so you can have it turned on without killing your battery<br> :date: __2021-04-25 09:08:10__

> Not sure it is working<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:48:40__

> Disappointing. I used this from the word go as I believe it to be a useful tool for its purpose. In the last ?week? or so it has been responsible for massive power drains to the point my phone switched off. The last episode was 70% power usage, yesterday, so unfortunately it is gone.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 01:29:57__

> Ok app, simple to use. Dont like that the camera keeps locking up, so need to close app and try again<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:08:42__

> Sometime difficulty scanning<br> :date: __2021-04-27 10:29:05__

> A failure, due to insufficient uptake! Hey, fools, THIS APP DOES NOT TRACK YOUR MOVEMENTS!! You can easily verify this with Settings/Location/Recent. What's your excuse for not using the app now, you idiots? Also, you can force stop the app when not in use to help prolong battery life...<br> :date: __2021-04-26 11:33:22__

> I iPhone to see the money in the bank not it's been 4 years stop dragging<br> :date: __2021-05-01 07:23:23__

> So so a pointless app when you have to use service N.S.W to check in everywhere<br> :date: __2021-04-28 23:02:58__

> The latest update has stuffed up battery usage. I work in a large organisation and 8 hours of background usage chews up 43% of battery of my Samsung Note 9. I literally have to keep my phone plugged all day at work. This needs to be fixed ASAP.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 08:14:42__

> Always when I want to use it....it needs to be updated<br> :date: __2021-04-28 07:00:21__

> Doesn't work on old phones<br> :date: __2021-04-28 01:45:55__

> What does it actually do? Does it even work?<br> :date: __2021-04-24 09:14:11__

> The new update drains my phone battery. I charged before I slept and it went from 100% to 46% overnight. I've removed the app<br> :date: __2021-04-24 07:41:57__

> A wasted opportunity. This app should have included a single consistent venue registration system and give feedback to tbe users about how many/new contacts they are accumulating, so that we can improve our social distancing.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 10:33:01__

> As much as I like the idea of this app, it started using a lot of battery recently. Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 08:17:27__

> I don't see the point. Only works if I activate it and sorry but that's not always the most important thing I think of when out and about. Would be useful if always activated!<br> :date: __2021-04-21 13:14:51__

> Other than wasting tax $$, this app didn't achieve anything on a federal level and on a personal level it simply drained my battery.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 16:00:15__
