### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very happy with this app. I've been using it since day 1 on a Samsung A20 and have never noticed any unusual battery activity or drain (I did not optimise the app). Now, it allows you to see whether new cases in your state are from returned travellers or by community transmission ... brilliant! I use it to check for new cases every morning.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 22:11:49__

> I had recently readded this app only to find the same experience as those mentioned below. Drains the battery & phone phone running warm! So I have deleted it again. I have a Samsung S9<br> :date: __2021-02-27 06:58:29__

> Last 2 releases draining battery badly. Been running this for the last year, and barely noticing it. BUT for the last 2 weeks and last 2 releases the battery usage is crippling. 50% per day, now slightly improved to 25%, but almost unusable. Samsung S10. Any news on whether this app has ever even been of benefit in contact tracing? Gov has gone silent.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 12:02:48__

> The app is consuming up to 50% battery draining my phone and making me question what value its adding as its not helped identify many links.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 01:39:59__

> Started using 18-20% of my battery just sitting there. I'll run it when I'm out but turn it off otherwise<br> :date: __2021-02-13 00:11:52__

> Does not give clear information<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:43:15__

> Great for draining Battery. Responsible for 40% of my Note 10+ battery life evaporating each day.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 12:32:57__

> Goal is great, execution lacking. Or maybe testing. Crashes my Bluetooth every few hours. 'I'm Alive' notification disappears quickly. Have battery optimisation off for this app. Get to work debugging... I need to reboot Android every few hours at this rate. And I need to get out of this lockdown. - 4/05/20 Finally works without needing to reboot Android to fix up whatever Bluetooth hack was originally used. About time; seems to have been a waste of taxes. 11/02/21<br> :date: __2021-02-11 03:33:27__

> Unfortunately it's back to having battery issues. clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, worked initially, allowing my phone to last more than a day again, but issues seem to have returned. Want to do the right thing and use the app, but it's killing my phones battery. Would appreciate a fix. Android system now also reported the app was draining the battery heavily. Thanks for the reply, unfortunately I am already on the latest version.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 04:22:44__

> Revising my review in 2021 (originally posted in early 2020). The app didn't work, despite the millions of dollars spend developing it. Phones that have it should have had 'hand shake'/'contact' with other phones, but so far, only four cases can actually be attributed to this COVIDSafe app. A waste of phone space, so I have uninstall it.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 04:30:14__

> Australian government, please fix your app. It drains my battery flat by the afternoon. I'm a sole trader, I must have a phone with working battery in order to get work (so that people can reach me). Currently it's 12:15pm and I still have 88% battery after uninstalling the app yesterday. If the app was running, I'd be sitting on around 50% now, draining the battery flat by 3pm. How can you ask people to use this app when you're making it impossible for them?<br> :date: __2021-02-23 03:13:40__

> Battery drainer. Had to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 21:08:44__

> Battery usage had been quite low, but today used 50%! Currently showing 0 total cases recovered (so no-one in Australia has recovered yet?) Hopefully the Bluetooth bit is working, hard for us to tell. Might be useful, but can't be sure. I've installed this app and so far haven't got Covid 19 (that I know of). Registration was easy, and can be done using a pseudonym.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:57:27__

> Yep. Got to have this app and still scan into venues. Apps don't talk to each other. What's the point.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 04:29:28__
