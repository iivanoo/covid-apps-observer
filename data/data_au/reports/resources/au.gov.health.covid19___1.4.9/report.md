## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great resource for reliable Coronavirus info. Used to be hard to find latest stats in a meaningful format but this seems to have improved<br> :date: __2020-09-08 06:19:23__

> It's good what is f..K going on ?<br> :date: __2020-08-04 08:35:34__

> Its wonderful app it would be amazing if you can add option that shows new cases in every state seperatly and not just total of whole Australia.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 12:49:09__

> Works well and is informative<br> :date: __2020-07-04 22:02:51__

> I'm thinking big box around the end of my bed = vr. Has potential if anything. He won't. / Rub my forehead LatcH<br> :date: __2020-06-16 09:18:45__

> Works as expected, an information manager, not a source (otherwise the app would need updating daily). Helps to get at relevant, reliable information, without needing to hunt around the web myself to find it.<br> :date: __2020-05-13 10:32:15__

> No idea if it works and hope I never find out<br> :date: __2020-10-29 09:53:40__

> Recent resource.<br> :date: __2020-09-07 05:43:12__

> Current version will not work because it thinks my battery optimisation is on - it is off!! Please fix asap as I want a working app.<br> :date: __2020-08-03 10:44:31__

> Pros: good to know the official safe links here. Cons: it's really just a collection of web links, nothing more.<br> :date: __2020-07-14 00:47:47__

> I'm looking for my location as my mum said there's been more cases where I live but it only gives U the choice to see Australia wide and not what U want to see I wanted to see my part of Victoria but it only covers Victoria itself and other places it would be good if it was more in depth<br> :date: __2020-07-02 17:02:12__

> Only used occasionally as it is quite bitsy in that finding info isn't that intuitive. Most concerning is that finding specific details about Victoria is a link to a powerbi report that is almost impossible to navigate on a phone, the point of the app. If you want to view graphs and charts, find your local municipalities etc, then I'd suggest you head for a PC that it was built for the job. Interactive charts are a good concept but not when prepared for a PC and viewed on a phone.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:30:45__

> Keeps turning itself off!<br> :date: __2020-05-19 04:42:12__

> It hasn't updated. Supposed to update at 9:00 AM daily.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 01:15:17__

> Never have received the pin to open it<br> :date: __2020-05-08 01:20:55__

> Won't download past 97%<br> :date: __2020-05-07 12:21:06__



#### 2-star reviews

> Was a pretty useless app, can find out the same info online or by watching the news<br> :date: __2020-07-27 04:56:10__

> Never been able to open app<br> :date: __2020-07-08 12:03:11__

> I'm sure it's a great app but there is constantly a reminder in my notifications that I can't get rid of. Very very frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-05-28 18:16:57__

> Not enough real time information I would like to see more statistics especially our Reff number<br> :date: __2020-05-07 11:17:36__

> Release the source code of both client and server and more of us will install this app... It looks like the app generates and uploads a private/public key pair and uploads one or the other to a central server and associates it directly to a user, other users when testing positive can upload their contact history to the server and matches that data to details of other users they came into contact with directly implicating the contacts, private user data should not be uploaded without consent.<br> :date: __2020-05-04 12:39:48__

> Confusing<br> :date: __2020-05-04 09:43:14__

> Will not download on my phone<br> :date: __2020-05-01 08:18:24__

> Takes forever to download. Been trying for 2 days now.<br> :date: __2020-04-29 10:31:12__

> I downloaded it but still do not know if it is actually working.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 03:53:37__

> Please add a prominent link to the covidsafe app.<br> :date: __2020-04-27 00:50:53__

> Useless. Very outdated notification feed. This app has life in my phone less than 5 minutes. Wish the government does more research for what citizens needs before watst the public money.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 21:25:15__

> There is no information regarding privacy measures for testing procedures and the storage location/process regarding retained genetic samples.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 09:05:12__

> Unfortunate that it provides incorrect information which causes difficulties for business. Since when were churches allowed 1 per 2sqm with a maximum of 150 for a religious ceremony - not a wedding or a funeral.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 04:05:26__

> Never used and a waste of money by the government!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 22:39:03__

> Very very very very disappointing<br> :date: __2020-10-11 10:52:04__

> Nice if big brother to secretly install this app on my phone without my permission<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:31:55__

> This app is data mining and just steals personal information without consent, the data is collected by deceiving the user by stating it is a health & fitness app. It isn't, it tracks your location,phone number, ip address, serial number of your phone & you, without the user's consent, uninstall immediately!<br> :date: __2020-09-18 12:21:30__

> Doesn't work<br> :date: __2020-09-14 02:45:21__

> I changed telephones and I cannot get the app for the new phone. It rarely worked on the old phone<br> :date: __2020-09-11 11:52:29__

> Frustrating<br> :date: __2020-09-10 03:00:32__
