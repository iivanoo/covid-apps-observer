### Description
> Welcome to HealthEngine, where convenience meets care.
<br>We’re here to make healthcare better by making it easier for you to find, book and manage all your healthcare online. All in one place. Anytime. 
<br>HealthEngine lets you take control of your health, allowing you to:
<br>• Find trusted GPs, dentists, physio and more across Australia
<br>• Book appointments 24/7, whenever is convenient for you
<br>• Save all your health providers in one place for faster booking next time
<br>• Find and book Telehealth appointments with online GPs and doctors
<br> 
<br>We’ve made it easier for you to see your practitioner without leaving the home, safe for you and your family.
<br> 
<br>What is Telehealth?
<br> 
<br>Telehealth is an appointment on phone or video, you’ll speak to your practitioner over secure HealthEngine video, regular phone, or by using Facetime, WhatsApp or Skype (dependent on the practice set up).
<br> 
<br>Many health issues can be solved through Telehealth and it’s a great pre-screener to touch base with your healthcare practitioner. Sometimes, the practitioner will need to see you in person and ask you to come in for a follow up appointment, or provide you with the next steps.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HealthEngine Pty Ltd |
| **Website**  | [https://healthengine.com.au/](https://healthengine.com.au/) |
| **Email** | feedback@healthengine.com.au |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great till new update never had an issue till now doesn't show appointments anymore for any doctor can't book<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:58:09__

> Used to be ok now lets you get to adding your name / dob and won't move to next page - obviously not compatible with Samsung Tab 6/ 7 tablets, just broken or not tested properly.<br> :date: __2020-11-06 05:19:45__

> This app used to be great, then the developers got greedy and it has become useless. I am completely unable to book my regular doctor through this app, I apparently don't meet the "criteria " so I now have to phone the practice directly. The app is to busy asking you questions so they can cross sell products. Bin it and start again guys.<br> :date: __2020-08-13 01:01:29__
