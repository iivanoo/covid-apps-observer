## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> 5 stars for the app, easy, convenient, etc, great app. One critisism though...I have two Service nsw logins, personal and my company, there is no way to switch users! I hsave resorted to uninstalling & reinstalling every time I have to use the other. Please fix or tell me I am a duffa & doing something wrong?<br> :date: __2021-01-09 04:40:12__

> Reliable<br> :date: __2021-01-08 20:49:47__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-01-08 05:47:30__

> Works well. But put Covid logon at top of screen since this is what I use most. Common sense.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:46:28__

> Successfully logged in! Got few text message verification code now. Thanks developer team, good on you.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:19:25__

> Working fine for me! S10 Android 10<br> :date: __2021-01-07 21:33:37__

> Good when it works<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:55:51__

> Because We Have No Choice<br> :date: __2021-01-06 12:02:59__

> App works seamlessly.. Including ease of COVID check-in/out.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:10:46__

> I agree with the masks rule & wear a mask at church, in supermarkets, shopping malls etc. I visited 2 nearby malls today. At Southgate Sylvania, all adults & most children were wearing masks. I later visited Westfield Miranda & numerous older people, male and female had masks slung under their noses, some with both mouth & nose uncovered. NO idea what good they thought the masks were worn in this way! Please publicise & warn people that this is NOT correct wearing of masks.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 09:29:56__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-08 05:31:18__

> It works, just a suggestion can you trigger a push notification to remind us to check out from the last place we visit for the government to perform a better and more accurate contact tracing?<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:55:24__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-06 22:15:18__

> Nice app, if you can add a covid check-in widget/shortcut, that would be great.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 06:36:47__

> Not real easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-05 23:51:57__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:01:14__

> For covid check-ins, can the app please remember the details of my dependents? I'm always checking in myself and my child and usually my wife, and it remembers / supplies my details, but not those of my family, so I'm always re-entering their details. Ideally it would have a check list of previously added dependents, where I could just tick their names to add when checking in. Ideally this information would be stored locally on the device, not on the server, for privacy.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 07:17:27__

> Good app. I suggest for the covid check in an option to save your dependants. If I'm shopping and have my kids with me, everytime I enter a store I have to add them individually, an option to click on their saved names would make it so much faster and I could get in and out faster.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 04:52:33__

> Can't wait to use this app<br> :date: __2021-01-02 01:49:03__

> Bug that kept meaning alway checking in to a previous venue was very dangerous. GLAD IT WAS FIXED on 5 January, however should advise users urgently to update their version<br> :date: __2021-01-09 01:39:17__

> when i check in to any place it wont let me add a dependant<br> :date: __2021-01-08 07:45:55__

> Most of the time it works fine and is simple to use, but sometimes it refuses to log in and other times refuses to register the QR code (and I am talking about the specific service NSW codes)<br> :date: __2021-01-07 22:59:59__

> When it works, it works well. I wish the Covid Checkin function had store and forward when there is no mobile connectivity. Connectivity in places like Woodenbong non-existent, and couldn't use it<br> :date: __2021-01-07 11:27:39__

> Covid check in not working this arvo. 2 places unable to check in since 12pm<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:09:25__

> I'm doing my best to check in and out every time I go somewhere but the app just stopped working (again) today. All I get is a message saying "an error has occurred. Please try again." No way to recover my PIN or password, just in case I typed them incorrectly. Tried to uninstall and reinstall with no results...<br> :date: __2021-01-07 04:06:43__

> A problem has occurred please try again later. I've just used the app to check-in when I went to a restaurant for lunch and no problem. And now I'm trying to log in again to check out but it keeps saying "A problem has occurred please try again later." My colleague tried his and he managed to log in with the app. Is there anyone experienced the same thing?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 03:19:34__

> Foursome reson it's now not letting me sign in with my pin<br> :date: __2021-01-07 03:02:03__

> I like the app, but lately it is checking me into the previous place when I scan in.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 01:14:36__

> Needs more enhancement<br> :date: __2021-01-09 03:44:16__

> App won't let me log in after last update. suggests there is an issue with my app or device, and refers me to service nsw gov au slash non-standard-software Decided is play certified, and there are no detected issued when scanning with the play protect in the play store. Can only check in as a guest. Kogan Agora xs, running android 8.1.0<br> :date: __2021-01-09 01:23:19__

> I have tried to use the app several times at the supermarket and coffee shops and it say not working at the moment try again later<br> :date: __2021-01-08 13:07:22__

> Couldn't use CovidSafe check in on multiple attempts, as verification code/s to mobile took ~1 hour to arrive (after shop closed) - signal wasn't an issue. Not sure if this is an app problem or somewhere else in Service NSW's system, but its most important function needs to properly work.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 08:02:03__

> Went to a Cafe in Yass today. Tried at least 10 times to log in and use the app. It failed every time. Wouldn't even accept my 4 digit pin. Not very happy. Had to do the old way...grrr!!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-07 07:35:24__

> I cant even download the app it just keeps saying pending have been trying all day.was using it before then it didnt work so I uninstalled and tried to re install no luck what shoild I do<br> :date: __2021-01-07 06:40:01__

> Loads to slow after loging in with the pin<br> :date: __2021-01-07 04:50:23__

> Generally good, but won't save one of my checkouts, so it looks like I have signed into a Lithgow venue every day, so must checkout again before I can check in elsewhere. Went once for lunch when passing through town. Pretty bothersome.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 04:32:18__

> The covid check in just doesn't work. It won't retrieve my saved details but it also wont let me re-enter them, so I've had to uninstall it and use something else.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 02:25:32__

> My husband and I both downloaded the app to use, but everywhere we tried to use it kept refusing to accept our details. We went to Service NSW at Tweed Heads South today and spent the best part of an hour trying to get this rectified with absolutely no success. We kept getting a message that a code would be sent, but nothing came through for either of us. When you're in your 70s and attempting to do the right thing and the technology doesn't allow it what is one supposed to do. The suggestion that we get another phone was not at all helpful. If we can't get this fixed at the source what is the alternative?<br> :date: __2021-01-08 01:28:53__
