## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:59:01__

> Really good design. Easy to use and easy to navigate. I would love to see a QR check-in and license shortcut widget and long-press on app icon shortcuts implementated to save time since we are using it multiple times per day now days.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 07:25:37__

> Works great since the last update. It's very simple to check into places using the QR code, and is very convenient as a digital licence<br> :date: __2021-01-15 04:36:49__

> I reported bud/ issues which are fixed by the developer. Service NSW app for Covid tracing is, as it should be, mandatory. Infinitely more reliable than the $-wasting Federal Govts LNP Covid App.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 01:55:28__

> App would be even better if the COVID section would let us save our dependents on it.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 08:59:56__

> I mean good app does what it's suppose to But since last update instead of opening app it takes me to the play store page Also suddenly it doesn't unlock with fingerprint Thought you fixed all the bugs 🤣<br> :date: __2021-01-15 10:10:24__

> Working now after the 3rd time installing.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:55:45__

> Sometimes drops facility to log in using fingerprint. Otherwise better experience than the private services<br> :date: __2021-01-14 01:30:30__

#### 3-star reviews

> Okay on my work phone but please make a version for older 32bit phones so I can use it on my own phone. What is so amazing about this app that it needs 64bit anyway?<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:01:27__

> I think everything is more complicated than it really needs to be<br> :date: __2021-01-14 01:25:53__

> Re COVID: no idea if it works or not. How do ordinary people tell??<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:06:29__

> App is fine for rego, licence etc but does not work for covid sign ins. Apparently a common problem for most. If you have this problem, uninstall the app and use the webform, it works the majority of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-12 21:55:35__

> Checking in/out of a location is ok. Suggestions: - Last checked in place was front an centre when you re-enter the app so you can click to check out. Time consuming and difficult to find the last check-in when you are in a rush. - Pre-set dependants during the checking in process. Very annoying to have to "add dependant" over and over again esp when you have kids with you. - Check in location/time/date history. To be able to go back and see if you have been in hotspot locations.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 11:12:37__

> Lost<br> :date: __2021-01-12 00:05:15__

> Covid option check in gone from app !<br> :date: __2021-01-11 23:48:19__

> We checked into a caravan park on Friday using the app over the weekend. Went to the club next-door for lunch on Saturday and checked in and out when we left. When we left the park on Sunday morning we had apparently been checked out on the app on Saturday 1.37pm. Same time we left the club. So app doesn't allow for a long term visit.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 22:13:38__

> Wonderful having this forced on us. Shame we can no longer go to the toilet without the government knowing. How about people who don't have or want internet on the phone? No longer allowed to go shopping?<br> :date: __2021-01-11 20:26:37__

> I think the app is great, however, many venues in northern rivers either do not use it or have a different system, which should not be the case!<br> :date: __2021-01-11 10:09:12__



#### 2-star reviews

> Pop-ups too small to read.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 00:47:09__

> Still has a bug with covid checkin. 3 times this week it has checked me in to my last check in place when I scan somewhere new. Not very accurate as a result.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:50:30__

> Mostly, the app works ok, BUT it doesn't remember your Covid-19 check-in if you minimise & then restore the app, Meaning that you have to check in again to be able to check out.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 03:23:16__

> Keep logging me to the wrong location<br> :date: __2021-01-14 02:50:23__

> Difficult to change password on a single mobile device without being able to close security code window<br> :date: __2021-01-14 01:10:40__

> QR codes at Coles and Kmart never work for me, even at multiple locations. Some bus QR codes don't work either. It gets frustrating and I wish there was a way to manually check in to a location on the app without requiring recognition of the QR code.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 01:28:02__

> Covid checking work about 60% if the time. With businesses thst use other qrs it's 100%. Also the government lied about giving millions in stimulus as it's only available on this app and less than half of the residents have the app and less can make it work.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 08:26:04__

> I can't log in, can't do anything as the app keeps telling me to add correct email address 👎<br> :date: __2021-01-12 07:23:30__

> Painful to use<br> :date: __2021-01-12 04:10:53__

> The app does let you log out sometimes<br> :date: __2021-01-12 01:17:41__
