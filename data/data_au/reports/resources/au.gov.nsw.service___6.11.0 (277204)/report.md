## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Directions easy to follow<br> :date: __2021-05-26 03:15:41__

> Great app all over, very useful. However I don't get notifications to remind me to check out of a venue unless I go back into the app itself first, which defeats the purpose. Also, I've noticed many places have difficulty scanning the Dine & Discover vouchers when the app is set to dark mode. Easily fixed by switching back to light, but worth mentioning for possible fixes.<br> :date: __2021-05-23 12:50:50__

> The app seems to have stopped working. The last 3 or 4 times I have tried to use, it said that it was unable to check in at that time. The QR code seemed to have as the venue name has appeared. Also, the vouchers do not always appear.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 02:07:55__

> Whenever i have to add my partner i have to type the whole thing is there a way it can remember him<br> :date: __2021-06-05 01:01:52__

> Is there a app to check tolls I looked and can only find the service nsw app and nothing in there is to help check my tolls<br> :date: __2021-05-31 00:40:57__

> Easy way to carry your licence credentials, however getting them can be a little difficult.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 22:08:17__

> The information on page is half covered over and hard to read top part can not be read<br> :date: __2021-05-24 05:06:35__

> Hi Service NSW Development Team, Will be great if you can add the login details inside the app, so we can view our email and mobile number that we use. Thanks!<br> :date: __2021-05-16 16:06:32__

> It works great then after a month it won't focus on code, I have uninstall the install to get it to work again??<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:43:49__

> Functional improvements needed * login: takes a lot longer than it should because keypad doesn't immediately pop up. Makes people in lines impatient, and I bet some people don't checkin because of this hassle * Manual edits for check-in Covid Safe function: occasionally I need to update my checkin/out times but I can't seem to. This would give more accuracy to Health contact tracers.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 04:08:27__

> Generally ok, constant issues with covid-19 check-ins as well as inconvenient de-linking of my driver's license.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 06:14:23__

> The app has generally been good to use, however it is slow to recognise a fingerprint or pin & it also has an abnormally high battery usage, draining around 17% each day after just a check-in or two.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 13:47:35__
