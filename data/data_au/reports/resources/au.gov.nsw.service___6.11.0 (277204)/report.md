## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Service NSW |
| **Website**  | [https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/mobile-app      ) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Licence was on the app untill update now it just sits there trying to link my account which is linked because the vouchers are shown. Churned through 50%of my phones battery and made phone super hot trying to do this.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 01:25:56__

> The app keeps rejecting my login details when I'm adding my license. Frustrating! I know my details are correct and have reset my phone (samsung A52) and still no luck.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 03:25:33__

> Sign in through mobile? Why not posible?<br> :date: __2021-06-03 01:42:14__

> Password reset, when trying to reset password, i change my password, save and log in button, It then says wrong password? What do i do?<br> :date: __2021-05-25 12:32:17__

> Can't the process take any longer!! Want to register my license and after 5 mints of waiting on a dead screen of loading gives me error 🤷‍♂️.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 10:29:34__

> Tried to log in and it keeps saying my code is wrong when it isn't. I have the latest version and still the same<br> :date: __2021-05-18 09:35:00__

> App is generally ok to use except the pin login is slow. Unfortunately it uses all my battery just for a few covid check ins so is unfunctional while on the move. I will have to delete amd revert to web browser<br> :date: __2021-05-15 18:36:44__

> The app has generally been good to use, however it is slow to recognise a fingerprint or pin & it also has an abnormally high battery usage, draining around 17% each day after just a check-in or two.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 13:47:35__

> this app is absolutely a waste of tax payers money - it gives u no opportunity to go bavk & fotth on different sites to be able to read the code submitted by Service NSW then return to page seeking the verification code - & round & around u go being cut off for hours after resubmision of code not accepted! Big mistake in not allowing code acceptance after leaving page - no other way to get code but to leave site asking for code!! Very stupid setup!! - typical govt rubbish made to lock users OUT!<br> :date: __2021-06-11 05:26:30__

> Terrible<br> :date: __2021-06-11 03:23:34__

> The "Simple login" feature is rubbish. If it misreads your finger print a couple of times at the beginnig, the authentication server comes up with the standard error message that it isn't available at this time. So I have turned the stupid thing off. You would think that the developers would have tested this.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 11:35:39__

> Unusable with latest version. Password reset doesn't work. And stop telling people to use the the network provided time cos that's not the root cause. Fix your back-end system. Guess what everything was working until your latest update can't out<br> :date: __2021-06-08 14:02:12__

> Tried to update the app and it went on and one gave up.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 08:29:32__

> Government scum! A lot of 3rd world human garbage work here.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 07:18:28__

> Is there a problem with this app, went to update, still waiting after 15 mins<br> :date: __2021-06-08 05:42:34__

> Very poor app told to use this app for D&E vouchers after THREE months am still awaiting would rate this app minus if possiable<br> :date: __2021-06-08 05:00:20__

> has been admitted its NOT secure,<br> :date: __2021-06-08 01:55:20__
