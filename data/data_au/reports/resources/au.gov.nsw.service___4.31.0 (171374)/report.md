## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> After the latest update clicking the app icon opens to the Play Store page instead of the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:06:44__

> There should be only one kind of QR Scan, it is too confusing and very frustrating<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:56:32__

> Easy to use, but not all Riverina venues use it. What are its limitations?<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:32:42__

> Only used it once.. it worked ok, but I had to copy and paste confirmation numbers. I don't like the way that some venues don't use the dot Gov website. You have to entrust your information with strangers. If this is law that we must comply with.. venues should use the same website. The app for ACT is less intrusive.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 04:23:05__

> Current HTC phone with updated Android OS. This app appears to auto update, ignoring the settings to not do so on the phone. This then crashes the badly written app for managing my hearing aids and needs a 40 minute process to remove and reinstall the hearing aid app and reset the hearing aids.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 23:05:42__

> It was ok<br> :date: __2020-12-11 22:53:12__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-11 22:34:44__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-11 10:42:06__

> Some aspects are very useful, such as the digital licence. On the other hand, it is frustrating that not a single place I have visited is using the COVID QR registration option.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 10:40:23__

> Ease to use and handy for my id<br> :date: __2020-12-11 08:44:06__

> The qr code does not work on this phone. The pin no. Disappears far too quickly.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 07:05:09__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:35:38__

> I have just spent a week travelling from the Murray to the Tweed and back again. That's a lot of accommodation and dining. Your app only recognised 2 venue's QR codes. That was annoying, frustrating and begs a lot of questions in regards to your App and the QR system. My spouses 3rd party App worked at every location, go figure. Nevertheless the App worked well for the 2 venues that were recognised.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:27:02__

> Easy to download if you have a compatible phone. The update says you can sign in dependants but I can't see how to do this. Husband doesn't have a compatible phone so I was hoping to be able to sign him in.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:21:53__

> Not that many venues use the gov app.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:10:58__

> This app was so useful, even just the times I had forgotten to take my wallet with me. Although, I'm unsure if it's an app update or something on my end but the app no longer works at all. When I try to log in I get a message that says " It looks like your device may be using non-standard software" I have the same SG20+ & it definitely has the original OS, doesn't have any ROMs, and has been certified by Google. I'd love for someone to point me in the direction of how to fix this, Thank you :)<br> :date: __2020-12-12 03:20:16__

> Couldn't login with latest update?!!🤬 New Samsung S20. Update to above...worked after restarting phone. Thanks.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 03:07:20__

> How come a proof of age card can't be on here even though it was obtained through service NSW? I don't drive for medical reasons.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:01:46__

> Not valid at many Cafés.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 08:47:23__

> Not many companies use the government code<br> :date: __2020-12-11 08:12:04__

> A real pain in the arse of an app. Wanting not just an email but my life history.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:50:13__

> Worked in about 1 in 5 attempts<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:19:59__

> 5 times tried to sign up screw this for a joke going uninstall and you can shove your covid check in too hope you all do the same waste of taxpayers money<br> :date: __2020-12-12 05:20:50__

> Covid test results not available after registering<br> :date: __2020-12-11 09:37:33__

> I was told that with this app I don't need either WiFi or Mobile Data to log in at a venue. Totally incorrect as it has not worked at least 3 times so far.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 09:07:00__

> The QR code on it never works.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 07:13:16__

> When trying to log my attendance at locations via scanning the QR Codes to sign in I can't specify the time I left the location and am forced to wait until I leave to sign off, only problem is the app automatically signs out when waiting more than a few minutes (and doesn't save location) when going back into the app when leaving and trying again I can't change the time when I truely did arrive therefore the logged times are inaccurate.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 06:58:11__
