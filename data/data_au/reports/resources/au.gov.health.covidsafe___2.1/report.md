### Description
> COVIDSafe app has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to help keep the community safe from coronavirus (COVID-19). Together, let‚Äôs help stop the spread and keep ourselves and each other healthy.
<br>COVIDSafe uses the Bluetooth¬Æ technology on your mobile phone to look for other devices with COVIDSafe installed. Your device will take a note of contact you‚Äôve had with other users by securely logging the other user‚Äôs reference code. If you or someone you‚Äôve been in contact with is diagnosed with COVID-19, the close contact information securely stored in your phone can be uploaded and used‚Äîwith your consent‚Äîby state and territory health officials to quickly inform people who‚Äôve been exposed to the virus.
<br>How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19:
<br>‚Ä¢ Download the COVIDSafe app
<br>‚Ä¢ Register using your mobile phone number, name, age range and postcode
<br>‚Ä¢ Turn on Bluetooth¬Æ
<br>‚Ä¢ Check that COVIDSafe is running when you are out and about or are likely to come into contact with others
<br>‚Ä¢ If you test positive for COVID-19, you can consent for your close contact information to be used by state and territory health officials to contact people who may have been exposed. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the virus by someone you‚Äôve been in close contact with, state and territory health officials will be able to contact you quickly so you can get the support you need
<br>COVIDSafe is an Australian Government Department of Health initiative. Visit https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app for more information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's probably great but my poor old Android's battery can't handle the strain from running Bluetooth and keeps on switching it off. And, yes, I've checked all the phone settings. Sorry Federal Government. I can't help. Now uninstalled. UPDATE... New phone, now works quietly in the background.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 15:09:05__

> A pity so many people fail to understand the importance and relevance of this brilliant app. If everyone had used correctly in the beginning, covid-19 would have been squashed within 4-6 weeks of implementation. Greed and selfish attitudes the reason.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 01:12:22__

> Has to be the good for all<br> :date: __2021-01-31 05:08:26__

> Solution for Battery drain- restart your phone. Had the batt drain issue. Emailed developer saying I'd uninstalled and why. They replied with a fair list of helpful info... including restart the phone as it resets something after a lot of Bluetooth handshakes...took my phone batt back to 30hrs from down to 18.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 11:48:46__

> My sister inlaw was tested but was not told to self isolate and has never re√ßeived a test result. That was many weeks ago. She had a mastectomy a couple of days later. Pacific Werribee test site.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 13:26:46__

> Have son with diabetes so installed but it is a battery hog. Disable bluetooth while at home. Battery usage showed 47% usage was by this app while all other apps negligable.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:50:09__

> Good, does the job. Not draining battery on my phone: 6% for over a day. Would be nice to see local transmissions as well as total cases per day.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 22:12:13__

> D3 i 2##w we4w w 6 wa 222<br> :date: __2021-01-24 21:54:19__

> App has started to drain my battery.... When it first came out I installed it and it only used about 1 to 2% battery in a day but now it's over 20% of my battery and I can not get a full day's use out of my phone as of this I might have to delete it as what is the point of havin git if I can not use my phone anyway if it's flat<br> :date: __2021-01-07 10:05:45__

> Great idea. Originally I couldnt keep the app open on my Oppo phone but I finally solved it. I turned off all the battery saving features as described on the Covidsafe help page, but the missing link was on the open app page, you have to swipe down on Covidsafe to lock the app. This prevents Oppo's aggressive battery management from shutting it down.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 11:49:27__

> Had similar battery issues like many others here. But clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, worked wonders. My phone now lasts more than a day again.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 11:05:05__

> This app drives me crazy. It keeps changing the setting so it's not working. Nearly ready to uninstall. It was working before the update üòî<br> :date: __2021-02-06 07:59:29__

> Doesn't look like the battery issue is fixed with the 31st Jan update. I have found turning off AOD (Always On Display) has dropped battery usage of the app considerably (down to 3-5%) so will bump up the rating. Real shame there aren't timely fixes for what could be an important tracing tool.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 06:40:46__

I would prefer to have the app but I can't stand my battery running out overnight, every night.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 22:27:47__

> Drained phone very quickly! Fed up w it & uninstalled it. 4 Feb 2021 reinstalled due to new 'ultra virus' alerts announced & 19 in my suburb (3186)!<br> :date: __2021-02-04 04:42:27__

> My airpods no longer automatically connect and the disconnect spontaneously since I installed this. Update Jan 21 - tried it again. My bluetooth turns off spontaneously. Still 2 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 22:40:40__

> Due to more recent Bluetooth disconnection I have deleted this app. Bluetooth speaker connected to Spotify stopping. I press play & it's stops again. This is the only new app I've installed. I think there a bug and this is the only different thing (new app) on my device. Had to clear memory to get Bluetooth speaker working. Galaxy Note 8.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 03:39:36__

> After last update the app start using a quater of my battery. Given the fact that we require to use check-in and out procedure almost everywhere, I dont see a point to use this app. Having a dead mobile does not help the cause.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 04:03:28__

> This app once I loaded it subsequently refused to function. I have been advised of the possibility that my phone being Android will not function in certain venues due to poor reception. I now just ask for the hand written recording diary as I enter premises to reduce the frustration of dealing with a system that appears to only work if you have an expensive device.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:26:51__

> Drained battery suddenly! Uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 06:31:05__

> If there was no pandemic, and when the vaccine rollout is well underway, this would be the first app to be uninstalled from my phone. As a software developer, my own app that I thought was a "battery hog" consumes a full 1% of my phone battery. The COVIDSafe app consumes upwards of 12% of the same phone's battery.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 17:22:17__

> Stop draining my battery! Conspiracy theorists would say you are in bed with energy companies! I've had this app from day 1. It's a good idea but not if your batt'y is out of juice. I'm switching off until this is fixed. Edit - I see Android devices are being used as a go between for iOs. I didn't consent to that. No wonder my battery is dying. Just record who I'm near, don't make my phone go searching for other iPhone users and record their info as well. Sort it out Fed govt! I'm not happy!<br> :date: __2021-02-05 12:56:05__

> Was ok, but recent update means it chews through battery at a very high rate - 10-15% per hour. It needs to use APIs to limit impact on battery. Have run it and used it for nearly a year, now uninstalled. Not fit for purpose in current version.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 02:54:04__

> This app was successful for weeks, then suddenly it said identification error. I never found out what the error was so stopped using it, Just sign now. Dave<br> :date: __2021-02-04 23:07:18__
