        "Constantly freezes, and makes you sign in each time you open it, despite having your sign in data stored on your phone, it doesn't allow it. The appointments you make are not displayed on the home screen as you would expect, instead you have to go looking for them. The app updates often, meaning you guessed it, you have to sign in again. They claim it's for your security, but its more of an inconvenience than anything else.",
        "Very easy to use. Fairly intutitve. Good app to book appts if you are deaf or phone hearing impaired.",
        "Super handy - I use this all the time for my kids Dr appts, very convenient especially if you want to make an appt asap and the medical centre is closed.",
        "Fantastic App. Love being able to book online! With 4 young kids trips to the GP happen frequently and not having to call with multiple kids making a lot of noise in the back ground &/or deciding that they require my attention and assistance urgently is much appreciated! I also love that I can specify a GP or just book with the practice. I can book and make appointments for everyone in the family through my account, while still having it booked under the name of the patient seeing the doc.",
        "Fast easy and convenient allows booking and cancelling appointments at anytime with ease any time of the day or night",
        "Very helpful and handy to book an appointment. No more wasting time over the phone. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
        "I have a couple of health conditions that require fortnightly ongoing GP visits. This app helps me to keep my appointments on track. I am a very busy person so it also helps me to keep things organised for my family. 05/09/2020 It is 3am and I remembered that I need to make a Doctors appmt, Health Engine to the rescue! I am not limited by business hours, I don't have to hold waiting for busy reception staff, I just go to the Health Engine app and it takes around a minute to book in an appmt.",
        "Easy to use. Able to search from different area to suit tome and work commitments.",
        "This is a great app. I can make appointments anytime when I am ready to not always in business hours. It saves time and reminds you of your appointment as well. \ud83d\ude91",
        "This app makes it so easy to book an appointment with your preffered doctor. No messing round..just choose your time and its done with even email confirmation and reminders. It's brilliant.",
        "Stopped using this app, my mobile number changed and I cannot change it online or through the app. Can no longer access to app due to access to sms otp. Cannot change is app and up to date!!! Your response is useless, read my comments. email bounced and I need to receive code to mobile before I can access app. It forces me to create pass code when I open app and then sends opt.",
        "12 months ago I enjoyed using this app. Now I wouldn't recommend it. It hasn't changed in style or context. And now I couldn't book my daughter online while ED doctor was doing their part with helping my daughter. I can't change appointments anymore and generally appears this app is now only worth to be deleted. \ud83d\ude2d",
        "This app is easy to use and also sends reminders in case you are a forgetful",
        "Works as advertised. Can add to calendar which is good for me. Reminds me, the day before. Can cancel and amend appointments.",
        "Very helpful. Sometimes glitchy, but worth it.",
        "Why do I need to get an SMS for verification? We get no mobile signal where I live and by the time I get somewhere to access the SMS, the code has expired. I've just about reached the point of ditching the app. It's s o frustrating that everyone just assumes that everyone else has mobile phone access!!",
        "Wish you could book further ahead, but it's a great app. No contact, easy to navigate for me it was. App not working now",
        "The app is great I book all my appointments through it and have not had any problems as of yet. They are very professional and courteous at the front desk, the Dr I see is amazing and always listens to my concerns and addresses them with care and understanding.",
        "UPDATE ON REVIEW: After a bumpy March '21update caused appointment fail for my doc booking, I reported the problem and developer was attentive and gave advice. I will need to await my next booking before I can report it as fixed. Hope. Updated & failed.. what a shame the March '21 update caused the booking appointment service to become inactive. Texts with codes keep rolling in but setting an appointment time cannot be achieved. It used to work really well.",
        "Best app. You can see your GP's available time on the screen and pick the time to book and you can also cancel for whole family members. Search for any doctors around your area.",
        "Good points: can manage appt bookings, can add other types of practioners for convenient access to their contact details. Bad point: If you log-out of the app you lose your Passcode access & have to do it again. I didn't see a warning for this quirk.",
        "Need to see my doctor but can't get in till ages when I call up, I get in quickly if I use the app but the update stuffed up the log in process and now I am stuck waiting. Already wrote a review and sent an email to developers but had no reply \ud83e\udd28 I think if you start an important app like this you have the responsibility to make sure it works and not literally stuff peoples lives around like your doing to me.",
        "Love this app, it is easy to book myself and my kids while i am at work. Although would love to get reasons as to why some doctors don't give reasons as to why they don't do bookings online when they use to.",
        "Easy to use and so convenient to be able to: 1) make an appointment any time I realise I need one 2) see what's available that then fits into my schedule.",
        "Again broken with new release. Logged me out. Wiped all my profiles saved. Everytime I go to main home screen, keeps spamming with SMS verification codes. Lots of issues. Also asks me to update with first card on Ehime even though I have updated. Terrible update!",
        "Super easy to use and easier than calling, giving the flexibility to book appointments when convenient for you.",
        "All health services should use this convenient system. It takes a load off the surgery staff also leaving them to deal with non-phone users and difficult cases.",
        "Doctors are friendly and professional. Bulk billing assists everyone. Clean and tidy waiting area. Unfortunately, the wait time for your appointment has increased significantly. 1:10pm turned into 1:45pm waiting.",
        "This app is brilliant, easy to book and cancel if needed. I can search appointment times easier to suit my busy work schedule.More doctors needs to be added to this system.",
        "Easy to use, no hiccups with app. Love appointments linked with clinics appointments schedule and updated in real-time.",
        "Phone anxiety has always been a big obstacle to me booking necessary appointments, so having an alternative where I can see exactly which doctors are available and when without having to pick up the phone is a huge help.",
        "For me personally this app has been easy to operate and has helpful navigation to book appointments, mark them on your calendar, cancel appointments etc. I highly recommend.",
        "Very happy with this app. Easy and excellent results immediately. Much easier than trying to get health practitioners reception.",
        "Makes it so much easier to book. Took a little whileto set up at first but easier than waiting on the phone.",
        "So easy to use! Booked in less then a minute, and easier to see times available for your doctor.",
        "Super convenient, view all practitioners and the times they have available, book yourself in and add it to your calendar for reminders.",
        "There is a graphic which says \"time to update your app\" which when tapped takes us to Play Store where there is no update... stop wasting our time with this click bait... was the $2.9M fine not enough of a deterrence for misleading users...",
        "It's so handy to be able to make your own appointments anytime of the day or night with your preferred doctors and add it straight to calendar. Love this app!",
        "I love this app for the convenience of making a Dr appointment. Easy to use. Simple",
        "I love this app, it makes it so much easier to book a doctors appointment, you can see what times are available and pick one."
