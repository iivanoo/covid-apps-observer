        "I had no issues with this app in the beginning. Unfortunately it has been CHEWING more and more battery power with each update. I put up with it for a while because I thought I was \"Doing the Right Thing\", but with so few app users now I don't see any benefit to me in continuing its use for contact tracing purposes. I guess it's all QR codes, face masks and good hand hygiene these days. Oh well, I tried.",
        "Have been using this since the start, as it seemed the \"right thing\" to do, but this last update has caused the phone to bog down and be unresponsive, and locked up a few times. Also have had lots of problems connecting to wi-fi when this app is active, but never when the app is not active (At home). Stopped the app android and phone is happy again. Unfortunately will stop using it for the time being. I would like to rate it zero stars but can't do that, so I have to give it one.",
        "The new upgrade is using a verification code that is only visible on the screen for 3- seconds. The size of the text is about 1mm high. To recognise and to remember a 6 digit code in 3-seconds in direct sunlight without glasses at the age of 65 is a challenge. A normal, intelligent App should help the user to log in. This is a complete Puzzle! The number of keystrokes required to log in and to register is simply ridiculous. It should be just scan the QR code and go. Sincerely yours; Eng. MT...",
        "Since the last update I am receiving almost constant pairing requests from unknown devices (though the app info says it does not send pairing requests) and my battery has drained in about 5 hours (though again the app says it uses only 1-2% batter per hour ... but that's still 48% in a 24hr period, which is significant).",
        "Got told to update the version so I did. Have to reregister again in the app, name age pcode and mobile number. Every time I enter my mobile number it is rejected saying it's been used too many times and I have to request a deletion of my number which I have done twice, uninstalled and reinstalled app 3 times and STILL cannot register due to my phone number being used too many times. So now I'm not using the covidsafe app because it won't let me... Awsome",
        "Has not caused any problems, operates consistently in the background and provides notifications seemingly only when necessary. Hopefully it is meeting the intent of its creation and helping to trace virus exposure, or will do at least if it is ever needed on a greater scale in our country.",
        "On Note 10, I don't have any of the problems others mention about bluetooth drop outs to car or Senheisser headphones or Samsung Watch. Edit:The version of the app in March 2021 has been the highest battery drainer in my apps list, battery that used to last 14 hours is lucky to make 10 hours now. April 2021 even worse, phone doesn't appear to go into low use standby, it is linearly draining the battery with Covidsafe app #1 on drain list.This app is killing my and wife battery in May 2021 <7Hrs.",
        "Too easy to accidentally disable or remove when in use or it crashes (either way you think it's working but it's not) also had to uninstall and reinstall because \"push notifications\" refused to activate. Would be nice too to be told someone near you has the app up and running otherwise what's the point? btw had no problems prior to last update! p.s. Have stopped using this cr app, can't see the point with QR codes everywhere.",
        "Constantly gives off update required notifications, has definitely significantly decreased my phones battery life and certainly doesn't seem to have been worth the tax payer cost associated with producing it, any 12 year old could have done a better job. Only keeping it installed and on out of guilt",
        "Ever since the update it drops out whenever I'm in town. Works best at home on my wifi, but as soon as I switch to data, it drops out at random times. Not very safe.",
        "Im hoping that this update is going to work, my covid app , wouldn't scan, kept coming up with the red alert,this started last friday, switching phone off didnt do a thing,.",
        "Maybe it's just because it has been so long since I installed this app, but I'm not noticing as many issues with battery life. Still drains fast, but I'm lasting through the day, and that's all anyone can really ask for.",
        "Can you guys please include a QR code option for the required QR check-in's? A streamline quick, no fuss log via the QR system within this app will keep all COVID related social discipline measures together in this one app. My belief is the convenience of this request will increase the numbers of people checking in- which current news has been reporting on the lack of people taking time to check in",
        "Seems like a recent update has significantly impacted battery usage. My battery drained in 4 hrs, not interacting with it at all, with battery usage stats claiming it was 64% the covid safe app. Next highest app was 4%.",
        "Just got in from NZ told to download the Aussie app, Did so and went to log in and get a message that my number is already registered to many times and I need to delete the app in order to re use it. I'm using the NZ tracer app and manually entering in the locations as I go",
        "Dosen't work on Smartisan U3 Pro phone...dosen't matter if battery optimization is on or off, app won't work due to battery optimization.",
        "Waste of time because bluetooth does not stay on all the time. Gave feedback on this asap last year and nothing was done. WA's QR code system is way better.",
        "Lately this app has been abhorrent. Drained a full charge in half a day, using over 60% of the charge by itself. No longer a feasible option to have installed.",
        "It says the app isn't working because battery optimization is on & it isn't & I updated it & put blue tooth on & it still says the app isn't working! Why? It let's me know when I have blue tooth on or off so it must be working to a certain degree.",
        "Sometimes I wonder why I am using this app, for me it doesn't make any sense, indeed using too much power, draining the battery, no feed back at all, please improve it or I will remove it soon. Concerned citizens.",
        "Well, let's think......loud bells or other bad noises have yet to go-off from the app - let's hope this is a good thing, and normal. I also feel it is a bit of a battery hog",
        "SOME feedback might have made this a success. Eg from a daily count of connections, to a ping when a connection was made.",
        "1 is app works or what it does if anything. With this app running 24/7 I should not need to Q-code anywhere, just show my phone (which should have an internal messenger to say for example Covidsafe has been running for n months, n days, n hours etc) and gain centre. Does anyone know what this app does?",
        "Latest update of May is causing phone battery drainage. It is responsible for 50% of battery usage and phone needs charging twice everyday. I have a brand new Samsung phone.",
        "Affects my bluetooth no end. Drops the phone in and out. Other than being a nuisance, I hope its doing its job.",
        "Very poorly managed. Always having to add verification code and details if I happen to drop out of service or go away from WiFi.",
        "The expectation that people will log out of a venue is naive. The failure of the app to realise this TWO WEEKS LATER, ignoring the scan I've just done and asking me to scan AGAIN if I'M NOT STILL THERE is stupidity. That this hasn't been fixed a month after I pointed it out is incompetence.",
        "Compare with check in, this is much easier and better solution. Many people failed to check in or not willing to when case numbers are down. But media and states are too busy fighting each other instead of having a common sense.",
        "The app registration process doesn't recognize New Zealand mobile numbers. Used the +642...... format and the app asks for a valid mobile number.",
        "Has been so long and seemed to be a good move to protect people's privacy. However, every states have their own QR scanning now, and I only have one question: has this app ever helped in contact tracing?",
        "Uses too much battery. Had it since it was released, but I've now uninstalled it as I can't charge the phone often enough to keep it.",
        "Have a new phone. Tried to open app and was told my No had been used on too many phones. Tried to fix up. Would not accept anything so Uninstaller it. Tried to reinstall but it just sits spinning a circle and saying \"pending\". I'll probably die from covid before it installs. I give up and won't have this app. I tried!!",
        "It forces me to update over data when signing in to a place when I've had WiFi connection for hours before",
        "This app was fine, until ~1 week ago, when it decided that taking 30% of my battery every day was acceptable. Given that the vic government doesn't seem to be pushing the app anymore, time to uninstall. Update: Still using a significant amount of battery, but it's far less now, and I am happy to keep using it. Update: And today it used 50% of my battery, uninstalling again. Get it together...",
        "The battery drain is just too much. Just running in the background while I sleep it's used over 20%. There's been enough time to address the problem, not putting up with it any more and I don't really have the time to charge my phone several times a day! Also given that we're actually signing in everywhere in addition to this... seems a bit pointless. Uninstalling.",
        "This version consumes way too much battery. Last night it used half my battery in 7 hours. If this is not fixed, I might have to uninstall it. Edit: the latest version is better on a phone restart, but slowly consumes more battery over time, until it drains most of my battery in a few hours.",
        "The real test for an app happens when you move from \"push\" to \"shove\". I recently needed to provide some feedback. I opened \"Feedback\", wrote my facts, and pressed \"send\". Nothing happened other than being told to \"try later\". I did this several times and eventually gave up. The next day I was informed it had been received. For an app that's supposed to be part of the cutting edge in the defeat of Covid-19, this was not a great outcome.",
        "3 times it closed and I had to redo my details First try I never got my pin to enter and now it doesn't recognize my phone number. We were guaranteed this would not happen. Update: All good now thanks.",
        "Running android 7. Won't run for more than a few hours before stopping. Rubbish.",
        "Has not issued ANY alerts since I installed the app. There have been numerous covid spikes since."
