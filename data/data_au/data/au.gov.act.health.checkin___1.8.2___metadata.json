        "App worked fine on my Moto G5 Android (8.1.0) until a week or so ago, since when it won't even open. I have just downloaded the latest version - no change. Please fix whatever you did to break it EDIT: following update 1.8.2, the app now opens and functions as before. Thanks for taking action, as the 'solution' provided to many people below was really not acceptable in 2021",
        "Update: app is working since v1.8.2 update. Thanks for the quick fix. Update: Installed v1.8.2 and the app now starts up; I will try to check in tomorrow. Thanks for prompt response. Previous: Unable to start app anymore since updated to version 1.8.1, 25 Feb 2021.",
        "Lost this app off my home page - looked at the 'fix failure to load on Android' option but no info given. Okay, now I can't post this at your POST ... Update : found that I had to give stars to be able to post.",
        "Great app to use! Only have to enter your details once at setup, unlike interstate arrangements. Just a simple click to check in at arrival, no check out required. Just needs more extensive testing before updates are released.",
        "Up to a few days ago this was near perfect. I used it everywhere. For some reason this weekend it fails to launch on my S7 Samsung mobile. I have uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled, but still it fails to launch. Something is now incompatible. I hope it's fixed asap.",
        "Apps keeps crashing and unable to start. Reinstalling does not work. Web form back up would be useful in case of the apps crashing all the time like this.",
        "The app wasn't working since the 25 Feb update, but it was fixed this morning (2 March 2021). At least it now works ok for my Samsung Galaxy S7 android phone.",
        "App has stopped working since last update. Crashes on opening. Restarting the phone and reinstalling the app hasn't resolved the issue. Very disappointing for such an important app, especially during the Enlighten Festival when use of the app will be critical.",
        "Up until a few days ago, I would have given this 5 stars but now all I get is a message saying the app keeps stopping. Samsung S7 phone. I have restarted the phone and uninstalled and re-installed the app.",
        "Since the update the other day I've been getting the following message. \"Unfortunately the Check in CBR has stopped\". Have reported it and have no idea how to sort it out.",
        "No longer functions at all since update to most recent version - stops on opening. Has always lacked a check out function and a manual time correction. Mandatory use in ACT has eliminated paper and manual records so making app workable is critical.",
        "Same peoblem on a Galaxy S6. Not everyone can afford to update their phones guys, especially in a pandemic. Please make sure any updates are compatible!",
        "I did an update and now the app won't open. I get a message that the app keeps stopping. It never opens. Worked perfectly before update.",
        "No longer working. Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times today with it still refusing to open. Previously it was glitchy but never this bad.",
        "Cannot get the app to work. It installs and then just closes when attempting to use it. PS I have the latest version android so that's not the problem.",
        "All fixed now! Make sure you update to allow the app to use the camera. That is what I had to do after reinstalling it.",
        "Was working fine until yesterday, then you updated the app and now it fails to open. Thanks a lot! I use Samsung Note 3",
        "Great idea and was easy to use BUT doesn't work any more on my Samsung after the upgrade on 25th of Feb. A bug must have been introduced.",
        "Latest update refuses to work on S7. Stops on opening. If you are going to update the app test it before release.",
        "App crashes on startup since last app update. Using Motorola G5S running Android 8.1. businesses I tried have no idea how to check in for you.",
        "Does not work on samsung J mini. Screen keeps going blank and won't connect to camera.",
        "It works for scanning the QR code. But I can offarhim why do I have to reenter all my personal details everytime I use the app for myself on my phone. The nswservices app handles this very well. Please start considering the user when you write mobile apps. Many miss some simple things that would make many people's lives better. I hatdusing this app.",
        "Does not work on brand new Mintt Ultramint Y5 mobile running Android 10. Hoping this will be fixed before 5 March when it becomes mandatory. Also, surely making a phone app mandatory discriminates against those with less technological literacy or capacity to use it?",
        "The app will no longer open since latest update. I'm not sure how I am supposed to check in to places where it is compulsory!",
        "Continuosly fails to open, reinstalled twice but still fails to open. Displays error message 'CBR code has stopped'",
        "I feel this app is important but 40-50% of the time it does not work. When reading a QR code it oftrn Identifies a previous venue or no venue at all - did not even give me option of emtering the code manually. Then today it would not let me check in at all. I had to reinstall which lost all my history and frequent guest data. Surely the ACT Govt can do better on such an important app!",
        "App worked for one day. Then stopped and has not worked since despite numerous uninstalls and reinstalls. Completely useless",
        "Crashes on opening following last update. Worked ok before that. Do you not do any testing before rolling out updates?",
        "for an app that is compulsory it makes it's difficult when it crashes after install.",
        "constantly crashes so unusable, also check in codes don't have a webform?? why not?",
        "Yay! You guys fixed the Andoid 8 bug, well done and works again now, brilliant app again.",
        "For some reason this app has been made mandatory despite there not being a case in the ACT for months. Personally, I don't like Andrew Barr knowing everywhere I'm going. Massive encroachment on our freedoms. I worry it will be a long time before use of this app is made voluntary again. Even after the vaccine and there's been no covid for years they'll find an excuse to keep using it...",
        "ACT Health, why do you check in but not check out, like the NSW app? If something does happen you have no idea if a person spent 10 mins or 2 hrs at a place. To stop people forgetting to log out, how bout a popup asking if you are still there 2-3 hrs after checking in if not already logged out?",
        "Absolutely crock.. has taken over 10 mins just to load the app, no ability to adjust entry time (been in the shop 15 mins before all the data loaded, allowed me to load additional guest) means your accuracy is way off.. No faith in this abominable system.. Service NSW app runs rings around this shite",
        "It won't download!! I started to install, but it was taking too long, so I went to bed. In the morning it was still trying to download",
        "Very poor design - does not have a check out function. No way to tell how long person has been in the venue.\ud83d\udc4e",
        "Last update has made app unusable. Please fix it asap.",
        "Has stopped working. Reloading does not help.",
        "App working again since update 1/3/2021.",
        "Was easy to install particularly for a tech challenged person. Only issue is that does not allow me to check out unlike the nsw app"
