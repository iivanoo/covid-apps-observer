If I notice this has happened I immediatlely check out and scan again - but it's easy for this to slip past, particularly for venues which have unusual names such as a company name that does not match the business.

There needs to be an accessible trail of log ins to covid safe venues which also allows you to choose which one you are signing out of and when. 4. There needs to be an off-line version of the digital licence (and photo ID card).",

I loaded the Service NSW app on my phone and went through all the hassle of logging in. It would only run the driver license registration and demerit points services NO OTHER SERVICES APPEARED ON THE PHONE. What a waste of time. OK so I clicked on Tools and got to COVID Safe Check-in. It says \"Put your camera up to the venue's QR code\" . I did this and nothing happened. Underneath the above message it says Enable Camera. When I click on this, it opens the App info screen. This is TOTALLY USELESS, except it allows me to uninstall the app, which I am very tempted to do.",
