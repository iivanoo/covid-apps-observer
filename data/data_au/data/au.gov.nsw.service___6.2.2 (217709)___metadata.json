        "UPDATE: yes I worked that out eventually. Your error handling/messages could easily have prevented this, and made clear there was an outage. Look at all the other reviews where people were unnecessarily resetting their passwords. *Moreover* design thinking - login is totally unnecessary for interactions like covid sign in! Lol. Update has broken login. Fingerprint no longer unlocks and asks for PIN, which then says I've got the wrong PIN. Hahaha, nope. Your app is broken, well done. Now fix it!",
        "Just updated the app on my Google pixel 2 because I couldn't sign into a venue. Once updated I was able to sign in once and now the app says I'm using the wrong pin. Very very frustrating since this is the only way to get In to any venues. It doesn't even recognise my email which I have been using for months. This needs to be rectified very quickly so everyone can get back to boosting the economy.",
        "The check in doesn't work properly... Once you've checked in and then attempt to check out it goes to he original check in again? Making me check in at the time I want to check out therefore deeming this function unusable... Fix this glitch... Also I've noticed that when you've checked out from one place and checked in to a new place it just references this back to the previous place?? Quite frustrating really....",
        "I was so excited to be able to have a digital drivers licence in my phone! Just called Services NSW and spoke to the great call centre staff. Unfortunately the app (and site) are down so I am unable to log in to the app or access my digital licence. The system issues should be resolved soon. I don't recommend using this app for now - it's more reliable to just carry the card. Hopefully the app will be improved and have an offline feature in the future.",
        "Worked fine but now refuses to recognise my login details even though works on home computer. Tried to set up a new account. Set-up worked fine but refuses to let me login. Pain in the arse when trying to register for Covid visits. App is useless. Got a reply. yahoo. still doesnt work. Useles C**ts.",
        "Delivers a lot of good service, but also falls short in a lot of ways. Istill have intermittant issues with logging in which is annoying. The notification to sign out, while great in principle, simply reminds you to sign out regardless of whether you already have. As someone who has to go to multiple businesses in a row, results in completely useless notifications most of the time and results in less effective real use. Could also stand to have a temporily offline mode.",
        "You know, the covid check-in option should be at the top of the page, front and centre! I shouldn't have to scroll down past fishing licence applications to get there. Academic right now because I keep being told that I can't check in right now. Thanks for the additonal feedback. Problem was internal to the app. Update: now am being told that my PIN is incorrect but I am using my fingerprint! No PIN involved.",
        "Surely the Covid check out reminder should only remind you 2 hours after you check into a venue IF you haven't already checked out. What's the point of sending you a reminder to check out when you have already checked out. The net result is nuisance notifications which in turn get turned off leading to a missed opportunity to deliver meaningful advice.",
        "It's such a rediculou app, why ask to check out everytime? We already check in with time stamp. And even if I had manually checked out, it still keeps prompting me to check out\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. And why not all venues are using the same gov approved QR code? Some places I cant use the app to check in coz it's NOT a NSW gov approved code n I can use a QR code scanner to scan, then it leads back to the organisations own website. There needs to be standardised QR code. Stop asking for check in experience!",
        "Ok, after a few hiccups and glitches things seem to be back on track. One key note is to only scan QR code directly from app, not camera. Thanks very much to the developers for coming back quickly on my concerns.",
        "One of the most disfunctional apps in the app store. Not sure where to start. Apps are supposed to make things easier. But this one definitely doesn't. Have to manually re enter everything every time I covid check in. Have to re login whenever I use a different service within the app. If you forget your password you can get sent a code. But can't get the code without the app closing and you have to send for it again. Could only be designed by government.",
        "As no data on my phone the QR code login will not work. Many places I have visited get annoyed . Some have said they will check us in, in a while but either forget or just don't. Some have said they will have no other choice but to refuse entry !. I looked this up and now know they can not do this. Again today another cafe did not sign us in !!",
        "Was working really well. Since the update, it signs me into previous locations and even signs me in to locations close-by, e.g. tried signing into Woodcut restaurant using the QR code and it signed me into Cafe Sydney. Also having issues signing in with QR codes. Very glitchy and is concerning considering this is our state wide contact tracing method.",
        "Latest update won't let me log into my account. Fingerprint, \"your pin is incorrect\". Pin, \"your pin is incorrect\". Login with password, \"your pin is incorrect\", followed by my account being locked for 30 minutes.",
        "I am so frustrated with this app. Initially it was working with no problems, then all of a sudden it stopped allowing me to check in saying to check the accuracy of the time on my phone? I have since been trying to log in and it continues to say incorrect password even though I know it is correct as I can sign in via the web. Dead set frustrating and I still have no reason why it happened to begin with. Uninstall, here I come.",
        "The Service NSW app is extremely disappointing. I agree totally with the comments below. It was excellent the first couple of times that I used it. Since then I have experienced all of the comments below. It no longer recognises my pin, the long way wouldn't let me proceed past the dependants question etc. The guy where I was going said to forget it as lots of people had the same problems as me. I rang and was advised to update which I did. I am going to forget it.",
        "This app was working fine for me for almost a year then all of a sudden out of nowhere it will no longer let me in. It rejected my (correct) 4 digit code and after logging out to see if that aids the problem, it won't let me log back in. I've reset my password and I can access my account on the website, but the app still won't log me in. Despite ensuring correct log in information, I'm still being told it's incorrect. Very frustrating.",
        "Whoa, have taken a couple of hrs. To explore this app covid checkin/checkout simply does not work \"try again later\" digital lisc same thing. Very clunky non intuitive. Why can't checkin/out be simply stored in a file on device and uploaded in the background at a random time using connected wifi? Some areas may be in blackspot or device does not have mobile data avaiable or NSW server is overloaded! You want people to participate in this, then you build in roadblocks to that participation.",
        "Frustrating.... No issues checking in but for the last 2 days it won't let me check out. Comes up with \"unable to check out please try again. Physically can not check out until I check in at another location. I have been checked into one place for 15hrs until I have needed to check in somewhere else. Covid tracing data hard to get right if I am not able to check out \u2639",
        "Ok app in principle...the app used to work ok on my Samsung s8 phone but I got a new Samsung a51 and its glitchy. I can't reliably scan and login nor scan then logout of a premise. I try 10 to 20 times and it doesn't work. Sometimes it works after a few tries, sometimes it doesn't work at all. This happens at multiple sites not just one QR code site. Eventually I give up which isn't good. I have the latest app version on my phone. Can you please help?",
        "Installed this morning at Service NSW office. Tried to produce my digital licence this afternoon and told me I had incorrect email/password/pin number. Tried numerous times to sign in and no go. wont work. Tried the help line...lol. 30 minutes of waiting and I gave up. 1 star from me",
        "Check in at a venue on a bus etc, check out. Next place I check in it loads previous location or the one before saying I haven't checked out or to check in there again. You need to sort out the bugs to make the contact tracing precise. Attention to detail is important here.",
        "Good app but the biometric login is broken.... So if your fingerprint scanner and home button are built into one (as is the case on most devices) I'll place my finger on the scanner and it'll go back home not actually log me in! Frustrating especially when you're trying to check-in for covid safe every 2mins.....",
        "Easy way to check in. Much improved with the updates. UPDATE: What's happened to the app? Now it won't accept my PIN? I can't apply for the vouchers? Fix these please.",
        "This app is useless for anything other than vovid check-in. I can't add my licence without contacting services by phone. I can't register the car due to the app not being available at this time. Once everything works, it would be a great app!!",
        "This app is seriously dumb. When you click on the COVID history tab it brings up a link which tries to log you back in to the last place you visited (!) rather than providing details of when and where you were!",
        "Overall an amazing app. Until a few days ago. It kicked me out and now is telling me my password and email is incorrect... even through its correct as I can log in on a Web browser. Please fix this asap!!!!",
        "Like the app, up/down scrolling much more usable than left/right. Check-out notifications when I have already checked out are a little annoying, please modify so that it only notifies if not checked out.",
        "It was fine until they updated the apps. Now i can't login via the apps and even on the website it seems not working properly too. So frustrated and scared since they got hacked a year ago. Terrible.",
        "The app has lost all my licence details. I can log on okay, but no licence if other items I linked are in there. Relined and it says linking successful, but then takes me to the NSW Web page. Not much use as I'm using this instead of my plastic licence",
        "Reminders to check out are now bringing me back to 'check in' page for a location from previous day. It's confusing especially if I already think I've checked out.",
        "UPDATING rating as the devs/support got back and helped resolve the login issue. Previous feedback Whatever changed with the app has caused my login attempts to keep failing. I can login to the service nsw webpage using the same credentials, but not the app anymore. Such a pity as this was a useful app. :(",
        "I have had this app for a while and worked flawlessly. However in the past few weeks it won't let me login through the app it says my password and email is incorrect it has been really frustrating because i can't check my details and it's making it had for me to use the Covid safe check in.",
        "When you go to create an account, it tells you to make a password of 8 or more numbers, letters & symbols. I've done that & it still won't accept my password. I've tried over 20 times. It's ridiculous!!! No help at all!!!",
        "Incorrect password at login stage. It is super frustrating as I need to upload and provide certain information for my new employer however I can't because it won't let me login. I've attempted to reset my password for weeks now and same issue.",
        "This app was working fine. Was there an update, because i can no longer Access the covid check in, and it is even harder to access driver licence with a picture.",
        "This is quite a bad experience. I am able to login online into my account but unable to do so on my new phone and a clean install. I have tried this a few times. Quite a poor implementation must say.",
        "Checkout reminders are all well and good, but please don't remind me to check out when I've already done so - that's just annoying. So I've disabled the new feature until fixed.",
        "I have to continuously logon to checkin or checkout. It chews my battery. I should not have to rescan the qr code for places I visit regularly. The covid checkin should have its own widget . Designed by people with no app experience.",
        "The response on my phone when I tried to download the app is \"this item isn't compatible with this device\" . I've never had that problem before. Should I even rate this app."
