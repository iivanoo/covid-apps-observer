        "As no data on my phone the QR code login will not work. Many places I have visited get annoyed . Some have said they will check us in, in a while but either forget or just don't. Some have said they will have no other choice but to refuse entry !. I looked this up and now know they can not do this. Again today another cafe did not sign us in !!",
        "One of the most disfunctional apps in the app store. Not sure where to start. Apps are supposed to make things easier. But this one definitely doesn't. Have to manually re enter everything every time I covid check in. Have to re login whenever I use a different service within the app. If you forget your password you can get sent a code. But can't get the code without the app closing and you have to send for it again. Could only be designed by government.",
        "I am so frustrated with this app. Initially it was working with no problems, then all of a sudden it stopped allowing me to check in saying to check the accuracy of the time on my phone? I have since been trying to log in and it continues to say incorrect password even though I know it is correct as I can sign in via the web. Dead set frustrating and I still have no reason why it happened to begin with. Uninstall, here I come.",
        "This app was working fine for me for almost a year then all of a sudden out of nowhere it will no longer let me in. It rejected my (correct) 4 digit code and after logging out to see if that aids the problem, it won't let me log back in. I've reset my password and I can access my account on the website, but the app still won't log me in. Despite ensuring correct log in information, I'm still being told it's incorrect. Very frustrating.",
        "You know, the covid check-in option should be at the top of the page, front and centre! I shouldn't have to scroll down past fishing licence applications to get there. Academic right now because I keep being told that I can't check in right now. Edit: not sure I understand the advice - when I use the app to scan the barcode, am I not already using the in-app device? Thanks for the additonal feedback. I can confirm the problem I am having (for the last couple of check-ins) is within the device - I have only tried the external option as an alternative, which is also failing.",
        "Whoa, have taken a couple of hrs. To explore this app covid checkin/checkout simply does not work \"try again later\" digital lisc same thing. Very clunky non intuitive. Why can't checkin/out be simply stored in a file on device and uploaded in the background at a random time using connected wifi? Some areas may be in blackspot or device does not have mobile data avaiable or NSW server is overloaded! You want people to participate in this, then you build in roadblocks to that participation.",
        "Checking in appears to work just fine including providing a confirmation that I'm checked in, but... When I go to check out, the check in feature has restarted and no check in was recorded. I've tried reinstalling the app and still have this issue, the rest of the app is great. The covid check in feature literally does not work. The UX could use some work also, if i've recently checked in somewhere and then I open the app, it should open up to the check out page.",
        "Frustrating.... No issues checking in but for the last 2 days it won't let me check out. Comes up with \"unable to check out please try again. Physically can not check out until I check in at another location. I have been checked into one place for 15hrs until I have needed to check in somewhere else. Covid tracing data hard to get right if I am not able to check out \u2639",
        "Ok app in principle...the app used to work ok on my Samsung s8 phone but I got a new Samsung a51 and its glitchy. I can't reliably scan and login nor scan then logout of a premise. I try 10 to 20 times and it doesn't work. Sometimes it works after a few tries, sometimes it doesn't work at all. This happens at multiple sites not just one QR code site. Eventually I give up which isn't good. I have the latest app version on my phone. Can you please help?",
        "Mostly good at what it should do. The Covid check-in dad been moved to the app allowing you to scan a business' barcode. However, when the app is sent to the background, upon resumption the app's forgotten you've just checked in and brings up the confirmation of details screen again. If you proceed here, the app then checks you in again to the place you had just checked in at. Trying to check out is just as painful as once the app resumes, it again wants to check you in. It all works backwards",
        "UPDATING rating as the devs/support got back and helped resolve the login issue. Previous feedback Whatever changed with the app has caused my login attempts to keep failing. I can login to the service nsw webpage using the same credentials, but not the app anymore. Such a pity as this was a useful app. :(",
        "I have had this app for a while and worked flawlessly. However in the past few weeks it won't let me login through the app it says my password and email is incorrect it has been really frustrating because i can't check my details and it's making it had for me to use the Covid safe check in.",
        "Check in at a venue on a bus etc, check out. Next place I check in it loads previous location or the one before saying I haven't checked out or to check in there again. You need to sort out the bugs to make the contact tracing precise. Attention to detail is important here.",
        "Good app but the biometric login is broken.... So if your fingerprint scanner and home button are built into one (as is the case on most devices) I'll place my finger on the scanner and it'll go back home not actually log me in! Frustrating especially when you're trying to check-in for covid safe every 2mins.....",
        "This app is useless for anything other than vovid check-in. I can't add my licence without contacting services by phone. I can't register the car due to the app not being available at this time. Once everything works, it would be a great app!!",
        "Overall an amazing app. Until a few days ago. It kicked me out and now is telling me my password and email is incorrect... even through its correct as I can log in on a Web browser. Please fix this asap!!!!",
        "Like the app, up/down scrolling much more usable than left/right. Check-out notifications when I have already checked out are a little annoying, please modify so that it only notifies if not checked out.",
        "Reminders to check out are now bringing me back to 'check in' page for a location from previous day. It's confusing especially if I already think I've checked out.",
        "Incorrect password at login stage. It is super frustrating as I need to upload and provide certain information for my new employer however I can't because it won't let me login. I've attempted to reset my password for weeks now and same issue.",
        "Says \"cannot verify phone number\" and then does nothing. However, I am somewhat relieved that this terribly-programmed app fails at its task of facilitating gross government overreach and invasion of privacy so for that it gets an extra star.",
        "When you go to create an account, it tells you to make a password of 8 or more numbers, letters & symbols. I've done that & it still won't accept my password. I've tried over 20 times. It's ridiculous!!! No help at all!!!",
        "This app was working fine. Was there an update, because i can no longer Access the covid check in, and it is even harder to access driver licence with a picture.",
        "This is quite a bad experience. I am able to login online into my account but unable to do so on my new phone and a clean install. I have tried this a few times. Quite a poor implementation must say.",
        "Works ok on newer phones but plenty of older people have pre Android 6.0 devices and guess what? Not suitable for your device message is all you get. Surely you can make it work on older devices that can't be updated?",
        "I have to continuously logon to checkin or checkout. It chews my battery. I should not have to rescan the qr code for places I visit regularly. The covid checkin should have its own widget . Designed by people with no app experience.",
        "I updated the app yesterday morning and tried to check in to a restaurant I opened the app tried to scan it and it done nothing was working fine till i updated it Saturday morning Edit thanks for your reply just seen it yes it's fine now it must of been the one time it never worked but was okay 2 days ago cheer's",
        "Sometimes hard to log in and forgets your details. 15mins to log in for COVID is a bit excessive. Typical buggy app. Why do you have to authenticate for COVID check in, probably the requirement from a meeting of halfwitts. Thanks for your useless reply, you have obviously never used the app. Thanks for removing your useless reply. Has your development team heard of beta testing your app in a real world situation before releasing it.",
        "Unable to login for the first time. Asks me to set a pin, after confirming the pin it just says \"A problem has occurred. Please try again.\"",
        "Wow now I can't even login shows error ? Yet I can login to website no probs :( Step back a version to 4.37.0 and everything works fine do not update to latest it has login error's",
        "Does what it needs to. With all the covid check-in I do, would be faster & easier if the covid check in feature was an app on its own.",
        "Lacking Biometric login, so it's always frustrating to unlock with a passcode rather than Face Unlock. Other than that, seems to work well.",
        "I cannot login to service nsw app keeps saying my username and password is incorrect I have changed my password and Samsung pass keeps trying to log me in and still same thing happens I have a Samsung A31 and my software is up to date please help!. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and also turned my phone off then back on very frustrating. I can login using the service nsw website but not the app?",
        "When I try to add licence, it keeps telling me to add email to link Roads and Maritime records. When I click add, it says success but again gets back to that page to add link.",
        "Does anyone know how to add this icon onto their home page for quicker access? Fed up having to access play store to open it every time I need to sign in at places.",
        "Samsung S9 I open and register with no problem. I open my shopping list (Google Keep) without closing the Services app and complete my shopping. I then try to switch to Services app and find it closed itself in the background. A number of times I was unaware of the need to check out due to that. With the app closing itself, check out requires I log in again, bring up the non-completed record and check out. That's inconvenient and, as I said already, a number of times I was unaware of the need to check out. Warn the user. Keep the app open until the user deliberately closes it. UPDATE: My Opinion hasn't changed. I want to use it because it gives me control but the Covid component is the source of much frustration. I like data off to preserve battery. If I forget to switch mobile data on before trying to register, I can't simply reverse out, switch on mobile data and start the app again. It remains unwilling to log me on. I failed to notice for a long time a link below the check out button would allow me to manually enter a time. Why not two buttons? Chats with other people indicate they are similarly frustrated by the app. If I watch, not a lot of people use it when entering places that have the QR code display. This includes people who have seen me log in. Overall. It takes too much time to achieve what should be fast log in and fast log out. I understand the need to have a drivers licence protected by other than phone security. It doesn't makes sense to frustrate people who would like to use the Covid component. Why not have components that require more security in a section that logs out quickly and the rest in a section that allows users to hold it open SO THE APP IS VISIBLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR SCREEN AND THEY DON'T FORGET TO LOG OUT. Sorry, getting frustrated here. If it is not improved soon I will join the hoards of people who don't bother",
        "Doesnt work after February update. Tried to reinstall AND reset my password AND both to no avail. Login is fine on the web so it's an app problem.",
        "Was working fine up until last night when I updated the app and now I can't log in - app stopped recognising my log in details and PIN",
        "Can't log out of location very easily. Have to book in again and then log out straight away.",
        "Fantastic app. Provides information on services available to residents of NSW. Even information on rebates you may be eligible for. Check it out.",
        "Medical venues (Hospitals St George and Prince of Wales) use there own QR code not yours it is confusing for the older person."
