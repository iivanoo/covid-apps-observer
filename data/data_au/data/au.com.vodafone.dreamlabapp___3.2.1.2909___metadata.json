With cancer being one of the biggest causes of premature death worldwide, finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. DreamLab exists to help us get there sooner. And the more people who use the app, the faster it works.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nResearchers need supercomputers to scan DNA in immense detail and crunch complex data. When you plug your phone in and power DreamLab, it downloads tiny parts of a huge research project from the cloud to calculate, and sends the results back to the research team. The more people who power DreamLab, the faster we can complete critical research. All you need to do is set up DreamLab once and it will get to work each time you plug your phone in.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve all been touched by cancer. Our best chance of beating it is by working together. And while sleep has always been good for you \u2013 with the DreamLab app, it can be good for others too. \r\n\r\nSimply download the app (#) and choose which Project you\u2019d like to support. You can also track the Contribution you\u2019ve made and keep up to date with News.\r\n\r\nDreamlab supports cancer research globally, and is powered by the Vodafone Foundation.\r\n\r\n* A compatible handset is required. Downloading DreamLab will consume data. Once downloaded, DreamLab can be used when your device (i) is connected to a charging source and (ii) has mobile network or WiFi connectivity. Mobile data to use DreamLab is free for Vodafone customers on their local Vodafone network. Roaming incurs international rates.\r\n\r\n# By downloading, installing or otherwise using the DreamLab application on your Device, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions found at vodafone.com.au/dreamlab.
