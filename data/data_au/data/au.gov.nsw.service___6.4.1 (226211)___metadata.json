        "Terrible! I was trying to check in but it said some message about not being able to log in ever again. I haven't used the app for about a month and this is what I come back to. To fix this problem, I had to restart my phone (which didn't work), and than reinstalled the app which worked but I had to remember my password \ud83d\ude24 Then, when I tried to checkout, it wouldn't let me so I had to close the app completely and then it worked. Very annoying!",
        "Has worked fine until a few days ago, it has logged me out and says 'incorrect email or password'. I have reset my password, uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous time but nothing fixes the issue. I can log onto the Service NSW website with no problems, so the password is not the problem, it is a glitch with the app",
        "Hi apps, Why doesn't work to my samsung phone this apps? Always says (incorrect email or password. try again) !. But if i use websites, it's working. Only the apps doesn't work. Too many time wasted to do uninstall and install, and reset my phone as well. But still doesn't work. Please help how can work.\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\ude14 Thank you for help\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d Resolved my problem \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Frustrating it won't let me use covid sign in at venues and for some reason and everytime I try to sign in it tells me my details are wrong. I have now got the covid app going ok which is good. I also need to use the Qld's version as I live next door to the gold coast in the Tweed Heads area and in comparison - the NSW one is a far better. - more reliable. I got my vouchers on my email address - am I supposed to print them out and one thing Qld are not offering anything like these vouchers - thank you NSW for doing this, great state to live in.",
        "The Service NSW app is extremely disappointing. I agree totally with the comments below. It was excellent the first couple of times that I used it. Since then I have experienced all of the comments below. It no longer recognises my pin, the long way wouldn't let me proceed past the dependants question etc. The guy where I was going said to forget it as lots of people had the same problems as me. I rang and was advised to update which I did. I am going to forget it.",
        "The check in doesn't work properly... Once you've checked in and then attempt to check out it goes to he original check in again? Making me check in at the time I want to check out therefore deeming this function unusable... Fix this glitch... Also I've noticed that when you've checked out from one place and checked in to a new place it just references this back to the previous place?? Quite frustrating really....",
        "UPDATE: yes I worked that out eventually. Your error handling/messages could easily have prevented this, and made clear there was an outage. Look at all the other reviews where people were unnecessarily resetting their passwords. *Moreover* design thinking - login is totally unnecessary for interactions like covid sign in! Lol. Update has broken login. Fingerprint no longer unlocks and asks for PIN, which then says I've got the wrong PIN. Hahaha, nope. Your app is broken, well done. Now fix it!",
        "Scanning into premises, the app frequently fails to register the correct location. As often as not it instead displays previous location. Have reported this major bug numerous times, yet its still not fixed. My bug reports have not even been acknowledged. What a joke.",
        "Worked fine but now refuses to recognise my login details even though works on home computer. Tried to set up a new account. Set-up worked fine but refuses to let me login. Pain in the arse when trying to register for Covid visits. App is useless. Got a reply. yahoo. still doesnt work. Useles C**ts.",
        "Delivers a lot of good service, but also falls short in a lot of ways. Istill have intermittant issues with logging in which is annoying. The notification to sign out, while great in principle, simply reminds you to sign out regardless of whether you already have. As someone who has to go to multiple businesses in a row, results in completely useless notifications most of the time and results in less effective real use. Could also stand to have a temporily offline mode.",
        "Dark mode is a joke. When I go to check out of the covid safe check in, I can't see the time at all. So if I forget to check out of a venue, and try to check out later, can't see the time. So I just reverted back to light mode.",
        "Surely the Covid check out reminder should only remind you 2 hours after you check into a venue IF you haven't already checked out. What's the point of sending you a reminder to check out when you have already checked out. The net result is nuisance notifications which in turn get turned off leading to a missed opportunity to deliver meaningful advice.",
        "You know, the covid check-in option should be at the top of the page, front and centre! I shouldn't have to scroll down past fishing licence applications to get there. Academic right now because I keep being told that I can't check in right now. Thanks for the additonal feedback. Problem was internal to the app. Update: now am being told that my PIN is incorrect but I am using my fingerprint! No PIN involved.",
        "Had this app on previous phone have a later model phone operating system android 5.1 trying to download on new phone told that app can not be downloaded due to operating system not being 6+. Have enormous problem understanding why a later phone model is not compatible. I now have no app other QR apps I do not trust and don't work the same way so I am now not complying with Gov request??????????",
        "Just updated the app on my Google pixel 2 because I couldn't sign into a venue. Once updated I was able to sign in once and now the app says I'm using the wrong pin. Very very frustrating since this is the only way to get In to any venues. It doesn't even recognise my email which I have been using for months. This needs to be rectified very quickly so everyone can get back to boosting the economy.",
        "The only reason I got this app was to hold an electronic copy of my licence. My licence recently had to be renewed. I renewed it in a service centre as I have a truck licence and could not do it online. My app has not updated my licence details and there is no apparent way to remove my old licence. I will be uninstalling the app shortly if this doesn't get fixed.",
        "I cannot claim the Dine & Discover vouchers via this dodgy app. I enter my address, it says I'm eligible, I click where I'm told, then the \"circle\" spins for eternity. Plenty of others say the same! I've tried on four separate days, and different times (in case it's overwhelmed, and our govt is poorly prepared again)... fails EVERY time.",
        "I was so excited to be able to have a digital drivers licence in my phone! Just called Services NSW and spoke to the great call centre staff. Unfortunately the app (and site) are down so I am unable to log in to the app or access my digital licence. The system issues should be resolved soon. I don't recommend using this app for now - it's more reliable to just carry the card. Hopefully the app will be improved and have an offline feature in the future.",
        "It's such a rediculou app, why ask to check out everytime? We already check in with time stamp. And even if I had manually checked out, it still keeps prompting me to check out\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. And why not all venues are using the same gov approved QR code? Some places I cant use the app to check in coz it's NOT a NSW gov approved code n I can use a QR code scanner to scan, then it leads back to the organisations own website. There needs to be standardised QR code. Stop asking for check in experience!",
        "Was working really well. Since the update, it signs me into previous locations and even signs me in to locations close-by, e.g. tried signing into Woodcut restaurant using the QR code and it signed me into Cafe Sydney. Also having issues signing in with QR codes. Very glitchy and is concerning considering this is our state wide contact tracing method.",
        "Was grate but recently it's become glitchy & drops out. Also I can no longer apply for anything & it's linking me to another email account & a random phone number even though all my information is correct when I go into my account. When clicking on the chat for assistance they end chat because you need to leave to be able to follow there instructions & aren't replying to them so that's annoying!",
        "\"Something went wrong\" or app crashing every time I try to add a license ... how unfortunate. Cleared cache, cleared data, changed internet connections and no dice.",
        "Have to have the app to claim vouchers, everytime I try to claim a voucher I just get a continuous buffering screen with a grey circle that says \"please wait a moment\", I have been waiting over 24 hours now. I have also deleted and re-downloaded the app. It just seems broken. Ever notice how this government never goes for the good option, it's always the cheapest. It's the nbn all over again.",
        "Pretty simple and easy to use nothing to it I feel like it has the most kid friendly information and directions to where people will not get confused and that's how it should be.",
        "I tried to create an account through the app but it says to enter a valid email address. It's my email address I use every day. How can it not be valid. Typical govt created app same as their websites and workers. Doesn't work",
        "Can't even login. According to app my email is invalid. And when I choose my phone number as a recovery option it says I have to choose the recovery email. FRUSTRATING.",
        "Fantastic service and staff, always friendly with a smile \ud83d\ude00.So much better than the R.M.S which was so slow and difficult.",
        "This app is seriously dumb. When you click on the COVID history tab it brings up a link which tries to log you back in to the last place you visited (!) rather than providing details of when and where you were!",
        "Latest update won't let me log into my account. Fingerprint, \"your pin is incorrect\". Pin, \"your pin is incorrect\". Login with password, \"your pin is incorrect\", followed by my account being locked for 30 minutes.",
        "Logging in is slow, it's very annoying when you want to quickly get into the app to do the covid check in and it takes a while to log in.",
        "Can't even sign into my service nsw account through the app, apparently doesn't recognise my email exists and I've changed my password 5 times and it still doesn't work. Even though I've gotten emails confirming my account had been made but the app tells me otherwise. Utter uselessness.",
        "Like the app, up/down scrolling much more usable than left/right. Check-out notifications when I have already checked out are a little annoying, please modify so that it only notifies if not checked out.",
        "It was fine until they updated the apps. Now i can't login via the apps and even on the website it seems not working properly too. So frustrated and scared since they got hacked a year ago. Terrible.",
        "Unable to login to the app. Whenever, I reset my pin and when I try to login, it won't recognise my new pins and it keep saying incorrect pins. This issue need to fix as soon as possible.",
        "Ok, after a few hiccups and glitches things seem to be back on track. One key note is to only scan QR code directly from app, not camera. Thanks very much to the developers for coming back quickly on my concerns.",
        "When using covid check in my app does not save my details (ie name and phone number) and sends me a code to enter every check in, however my husbands app saves his details and let's him check in without waiting for a code. I can't locate any settings to change this.",
        "I have applied for dine n discover vouchers and they display in the app. But unless you search a specific postcode or suburb it's useless, why can't the map show all businesses near ne not just a searched suburb? No point for businesses if you can't find them. Please fix it.",
        "After updating the app, I can't log in despite I tried lots of time yesterday or today. I can use my email and password to get in on the website, but not via app. \ud83d\ude25",
        "The app has lost all my licence details. I can log on okay, but no licence if other items I linked are in there. Relined and it says linking successful, but then takes me to the NSW Web page. Not much use as I'm using this instead of my plastic licence",
        "Reminders to check out are now bringing me back to 'check in' page for a location from previous day. It's confusing especially if I already think I've checked out."
