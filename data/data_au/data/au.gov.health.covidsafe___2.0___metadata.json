        "Phone number registration is active and working now (6pm Sunday). I don't like that it needs Location permission for it to be active and works properly (though GPS location is not required to be turned on) Update: 01/11 uninstalled the app because it now needs GPS turned on to be active now 19/12 reinstalled due to flare up in Northern beaches, but I will not turn on GPS",
        "I have tried to do the right thing but having to have location on whenever I leave the house is causing problems with other apps and I'm so fed up with changing location permissions only to have them mysteriously change themselves back every time I restart my phone. I'm now being bombarded with ads for places I've walked past (not visited) and I can't seem to get rid of them. Never had this problem before installing covidsafe.",
        "Having the same problem described below. I own an OPPO phone and constantly get messages about disabling battery optimisation. I do so and within a few hours get another message. I'm sick of maintaining it. Fix it or I'll remove it and take my chances. I haven't yet seen any stats as to the success of the app in doing the job it's designed for. Unlikely if others are having the same issues.",
        "Has really started draining battery, single biggest battery use of any app on my phone. Really needs to be fixed otherwise people won't install it. I can't have my phone dying while I'm out but it won't last 8 hours of even light usage since the last update.",
        "I really like the idea of this app if it actually worked... But it doesn't. It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.",
        "Further improvement needed to minimise drainage of battery. The app is on 24/7 in the background to constantly check whether it is active. I need not to turn it on while inside my home to safe on battery power. Areas for improvement - have a button to turn the app on or off to save battery power - disable the function to constantly checking whether it is active",
        "Was running fine for months then, I'm thinking at last update, it kept turning my Location on and draining my battery. I looked into the app and it is not active due to Location turned off. Before I only had to have \"Location Permission\" turned on for this app... Not the overall location. Not going to turn the Loaction on. I will just leave it inactive. These systems won't work if they're not usable.",
        "Its a battery drain maybe since last update? I can have a full battery at 2pm then 20% at 4pm when my phone has done nothing. This app is the only one listed as any significant battery drain. Never used to be this way but I have to keep it off. Don't like travelling home at night with no phone.",
        "The concept makes sense, but as with many others I too have noticed the last update has killed the battery life on my 4000mAh flagship phone, using far more than it did previously. Please fix this or I will have no choice but to uninstall. I can't have my phone dying on my halfway through the day in the name of a safety app that kills my phone, preventing my from using digital Covid sign-ins. Thanks",
        "I'd been using this OK for months and (probably after an update) I discovered it was asking for location access and no battery optimisation. Having allowed those, it started draining the battery - 27% one day. I removed it, rebooted the phone and reinstalled the app. So far so good today. About 5th in the list of battery users at 1.8%.",
        "Great idea but terrible implementation. Runs constantly in the background with no way to turn it off when you are just at home and don't need it, only option is to uninstall. By default has a persistent notification to tell you whether it's working which is annoying.",
        "I'm a supporter of the concept but have serious doubts about the utility of this implementation. I've not heard of any positive track and trace outcomes in months. At the same time the current version now drains my battery at about twice the rate of all my other apps combined. The government now has a short time to show cause why this app should be retained, otherwise I plan to uninstall.",
        "App not active unless battery optimization is disabled. Unfortunately my phone turns optimization back on again every time I disabled it. It should be \"set and forget\" instead of having to do this every time I am going out. No good as it is.",
        "I have had bluetooth connection issues since installing this app, which I can deal with, but over the past couple of months it has started using ridiculous amounts of battery (like 80% of battery used up in 4 hours!) - the app isn't much use if it is going to kill my phone before I can get home.",
        "There should be an option to exit this app, when at home. It consumes battery unnecessarily, when the Bluetooth and location is turned off. You should understand there are people out there who do not enable location and Bluetooth unnecessarily, when not in use. I have to stop this app everytime when at home.",
        "A couple of updates ago the app started constantly crashing in the background. I reported the problem and in response got a generic email telling me how important it is to have COVIDSafe running at all times. Yes, I know, I would if it worked!",
        "App no longer works if location is off and the App website states that Google require this for Bluetooth to work. This contradicts the fact that my other apps use Bluetooth fine w/o location on. Contact tracing does not need to know where I was, just who I contacted. And Google certainly does not need to know where I was. Will be leaving disabled.",
        "It's probably great but my poor old Android's battery can't handle the strain from running Bluetooth and keeps on switching it off. And, yes, I've checked all the phone settings. Sorry Federal Government. I can't help. Now uninstalled. UPDATE... New phone, now works quietly in the background.",
        "My review disappeared, so here's another. This app does not appear to work on bbk phones (Oppo going by reviews here, and Realme going by my own experience with my Realme X2 Pro). It tells you it's not active and battery optimisation needs to be switched off. And you do that, use another app and it's inactive again. Still not fixed, and it's mid November.",
        "It does what's expected. I have no loss of Bluetooth functions. Fitbit & earphones still run ok. It doesn't collect phone numbers, it collects & stores another phone's bt id number, only if near for 15mins. Those numbrs tell you nothing, even if you could see them. The remotely held database dept. knows the registered phone numbers... only if you d/load your BT id collection, only if you are diagnosed with CV-19. Dislike: Notification uses too much bar space. Wld prfr coloured dot on the icon.",
        "Utter battery hog, won't run properly with battery optomisation or battery saver on and keeps interfering with other bluetooth devices like my headphones, has been since day 1 and the issue still hasn't been fixed.",
        "Update Nov 2020: Uninstalled due to battery drain and overheating on a Galaxy S10 5G. Too risky to leave installed. No issues on Galaxy A30. Down to 4 stars. Original Review: Zero issues. Works as intended. Some initial issues with Bluetooth streaming audio but these are easily overcome with updates and firmware updates on speakers. Original review 5 stars.",
        "Be nice if it worked. Despite having the battery optimisation turned off for this app, it keeps coming up \"inactive\" and telling me to change the setting. I agree and it says active. A few minutes later I get a notification that it's inactive again.",
        "I've only just downloaded the app, and am rating it high so that more people can see this app, download it and stay safe. Have seen some negative reviews about this thing massacring battery life, and I do hope that gets fixed, but props to the government for doing this for us. They're trying their hardest, and I respect it.",
        "Useless . There apparently a cluster 100m from my house. Would have thoight this is the perfect way to keep people informed. Seriously need to be able to opt in for location sharing and no 15min bs. Some people are willing to forego a little privacy to be able to collect the info required to keep this under control",
        "The Australian Government pushed everyone to install this, but on iOS it was problematic, yet instead of improving it, or pivoting to create a central check-in register, all businesses in Australia adopted disparate approaches for Covid check-in, thereby hampering covid tracing. At the very least they could have indicated it was a waste of time and told people to uninstall.",
        "Nothing wrong with oppo phones. Your oppo is protecting your information and phone processes. This app is invasive and shouldn't rely on 24/7 access. Taking the QR code photo should be suffice. Seems like the government doesn't trust us to do the right thing.",
        "Total lack of information. Nobody seems to be running this useless app. Absolute disgrace for the minister in charge of it. Never heard a word from him. No idea if it is used at all or just switched off. A major deceit on the Australian public. Lukily the States are manually doing what this National app was supposed to do.",
        "Something need to be done to improve this Apps as it goes to inactive by itself without warning and need my constant awareness to check whether it is still active with the green icon. It just defeats the purpose if it does not works as it required to.",
        "Programers don't know how to optimise the battery usage on Samsung phones, you send the feedback and they reply with useless advise. Battery depleted in 4 hours instead of 2 days, application has to go.",
        "When first released this app didn't have any issues that concerned me. A subsequent update has resulted in it causing significant battery drain though, with the app now the largest consumer of my phone's battery, using more battery each day than an hour+ of Web browsing.",
        "Not able to update phone number. Only way is to uninstall and reinstall, which means the previous data is now unreachable. If I had contact with a positive case last week on the old number, I would not be reachable.",
        "it says it's free. but I paid for it in my taxes and it has not resulted in one successful contact trace. you should still download it though and maybe we'll get some return on investment.",
        "Happy to do my bit to help out with covid management. Having said that my battery usage has gone through the roof since last update. COVIDSafe is at the top of my battery use list by a country mile. Hopefully the update I have done this morning will fix.",
        "Significant battery drain as app need to disable battery optimisation operating 24/7. Need to utilise an option where app is on only when outside of home if battery optimisation needs to be disabled to work.",
        "Bluetooth issues on android device, have found that the app is causing my Bluetooth to drop in and out for a split second at a time, very annoying. Re-installed 4 months later, disappointing that problem still has not been fixed.",
        "Recent updates have screwed with Bluetooth settings on other devices, eg smartwatch, BP monitor. To get them working again had to uninstall and reinstall app...",
        "When I have WIFI on, it says \"No Internet Connection\" but running on a mobile without WIFI, it connects. Why? My WIFI has internet connection, but this COVIDSafe app refuses to use it. Seems pretty stupid to me, that it can't connect for updates etc...",
        "I saw an dialog saying this app will log locations for debugging purpose after an update. But the installed app says they do not log location and access to location is required for bluetooth only. However the app keeps showing warning until you turn on GPS. It does not make sense.",
        "It keeps telling me to turn on Bluetooth for it to work. My Bluetooth is on 24/7. It's frustrating."
