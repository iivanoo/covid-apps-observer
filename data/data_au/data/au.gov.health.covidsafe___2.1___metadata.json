        "This app was successful for weeks, then suddenly it said identification error. I never found out what the error was so stopped using it, Just sign now. Dave",
        "Have son with diabetes so installed but it is a battery hog. Disable bluetooth while at home. Battery usage showed 47% usage was by this app while all other apps negligable.",
        "Been using it since it launched to do the right thing. Now can't have it on the phone anymore due to battery drain issues. Been a few times when i was out and about and my phone died on me before i expected it to. Battery usage stats show that this app is consuming between 40 to 50 percent of the battery charge. The battery is running out by the evening even when the phone is practically idle.",
        "Terrible battery drain in recent weeks, needing to charge my phone multiple times a day. Found phone/battery hot to touch and hot when charging. Discovered COVIDSafe using 35-75% of my battery per day!! Unacceptable, given is only running in background. Now only turning Bluetooth on and allowing it to operate when out and today still have 50% power after 3pm. Was at the point of replacing my battery (less than 1 year old!), but think I'll uninstall this until resolved by a new update instead!!",
        "Had this from the beginning, but recently battery life has been horrible. I can see my battery losing 1% every 10mins or so. When I checked the android battery usage, this app is number 1 of battery consumption and in background mode! taking well over 10% of overall battery consumption. I had to disable Bluetooth to ensure this app is disabled. Going to uninstall this now since the news says contact tracing finds data from this app useless anyway.",
        "Bluetooth regularly crashes now, can happen every minute. Ironically happened as I was writing this review. Seems to be a common occurrence when I read these reviews. As soon as I uninstalled this app the crashing stopped. I really want to use this app to play my part but its impossible to do so with such bugs",
        "I've had CovidSafe running on my phone since it was released. However, over the last month, the battery drain has gone from barely a blip to 40% drain reach day. I've actually had to force stop the app, and resume when I leave the house (provided I remember to do so!). It is a very obvious problem looking at the other reviews, and really needs to be fixed if this app has any hope of working as it was meant to.",
        "You need to read these reviews! I'm stopping using it until you roll back to the version prior to 2.0. As it is, it kills my battery. It is a joke that the FAQ explicitly says that it consumes \"minimal\" power of 1-2% per hour on average! You need to fire the math geniuses that couldn't work out that this means 16-32% (on average! It could be worse!) per day, aiming you sleep and charge for 8 hours a day. That is nowhere near minimal. That's the highest of any other apps by far!",
        "I've intermittently noticed a huge battery drain and overheating issue starting just recently too. I've had it installed from the very beginning and it didn't used to be like this. I fully support this app's purpose, but it's unusable when it acts up. Seems like many others are experiencing the same issue. If I turn off Bluetooth for a while (essentially disabling COVIDSafe from scanning) it does seem to fix it temporarily. I just have to remember to turn it back on some time later.",
        "I have had this app since it was introduced and in the beginning it was great. However, just recently my phones battery life has seriously decreased and I can barely get through the day. Initially I thought it was an issue that had come from Samsung's latest update but after looking at my battery settings I discovered that this app consistently uses around 40%. This is crazy! I am genuinely considering uninstalling the app until this problem is fixed because I cannot continue to live like this.",
        "Have been using the app for a while and I think it is a good idea, but recently the battery usage has been through the roof. In an average 8hrs it has used 20% of my phones battery on it own, second closest us facebook at half the usage and I am actively using that app regularly. (According to the battery usage monitor in settings) Something has changed to make the usage unreasonably high and it's starting to be somewhat suspect.",
        "I've had it on my S10+ since the beginning, but like a lot of others the battery usage recently has been ridiculous. I can see a lot of people uninstalling the app if this isn't addressed, which is of course not helping us all stay safe. I'm pretty tempted to uninstall it myself, 30%-40% of my battery usage is this one app.",
        "Was happy to use and have used it for months and really want to to keep safe, but am uninstalling. I have been teaching all day and hardly used my phone, to come at 1pm and it's off due to drained battery. Tracked it in my usage and it's draining it like crazy. I'm sorry but it's more dangerous for me to be without my phone when out and about especially when using public transport. Not okay. Will reinstall when this is fixed. Samsung s10+.",
        "I have been using the app since it came out. However recently it has started to drain my phone battery within 12 hours. Without the app my phone lasts over 36 hours. Looked at battery usage stats and this app was using about 55% of my battery. I had to remove it as I can no longer get through a day with it on my phone anymore.",
        "Bluetooth issues. Ever since installing I've had BT issues with other devices not being able to reconnect, without clearing cache and data, then all other devices reconnect for a few days, then problems start again. Edit 27 Dec. 2020. Sick of this randomly burning battery. Fix it dev or will be uninstalling. We are trying to do the right thing, but this app leaves my family vulnerable with potential flat batteries on our phones, which negates usage of this app!",
        "The last update on Dec 2020 is causing severe Battery Drain ~30% of phone battery usage & Bluetooth interference causing other devices to frequently drop out. Deleting App resolves both issues. Please fix app to avoid permanent deletion. Unfortunately, feedback to tech support with specific data is simply brushed off with a copy/paste marketing response.",
        "Had it since it first came out and it was great. But recently it has drained my battery. To the point of it needed a charge two times a day and me barely using my phone. Even on charge, it took a long time, including one day It took over 6 hours to charge my phone. I had to turn off the phone and close all apps, clear the cache, just to charge it. I thought it was my phone dying. Ive since turned off the app, my phone can last all day even with my normal use of the phone. Issue needs fixin",
        "I thought my phone was faulty with the unmissable increased battery usage. After checking battery usage saw it was this app. Checked the app comments and glad I wasn't going crazy. Also contacted the development team as a good citizen, they pretty much dismissed the feedback. People want to do the right thing but if you are flat out going to deny there is no issue with the app, well not sure what else we can do.",
        "Battery drain is caused by them implementing something called the herald protocol.1.If you have an iOS device with app on, it can use a nearby Android to find other iOS devices with the app. Ergo all users record all close contacts in the same area. 2. Location services become active when you use your phone or are looking at your screen. 3. Improves ability to get digital handshakes by continuously exchanging info like distance between contacts while users are near each other. AKA dead battery.",
        "Since installing the update using the Herald protocol, Android consistently reports this is the most battery consuming app running, even in background, coming immediately after Screen usage and Google Play Services. Phone no longer lasts 12 hours before going into power save modes. No point having COVID Safe running if the phone is dead.",
        "Was working Ok until recent weeks as- huge increase in battery usage by CovidSafe after updating app. Today (the day I am uninstalling the app after using it since it was first released) it was responsible for 70% of battery usage that left me with 6% of battery at 6pm. Please fix this fault many are reporting. I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Android phone. My husband uses a Note 9 and his CovidSafe battery usage is acceptable.",
        "All too familar story- had the app since it was released but have been experiencing excessive battery usage since the last update. I was persevering but today my phone was dead by 5.30pm. Very bad timing since my myki is on the phone and I needed to take the train home- luckily found a charging point but I can't risk being stranded in future so will be uninstalling this app until the problem is fixed.",
        "Keeps switching off because battery saver mode is enabled it says, what difference does it make if battery saver is on or off, I've gone to settings and battery saver is off turned but the app keeps switching off so much for a tracer app it's off most of the time. Why not fix it because it's as good as useless. I have a new Android 10 phone",
        "I had this from the start. Unfortunately I had to uninstall. Battery drain has suddenly spiked. System settings show this app uses well over %30 of my battery just sitting in the background. It was a great idea but surely doesn't need such high energy requirements. Would install again if power issue is fixed.",
        "Battery killer. I thought I need to purchase a new battery. Until I checked which app drains the battery. 62% by Covid safe. Can't get through the day anymore. Game over. Update: Removing the app not only fixed my battery drain but also re-established my bluetooth connection to my Toyota car. Apparently CovidSafe does change the bluetooth protocol used. Safe for Covid - unsafe for using mobile phone whilst driving. Which evil to take?",
        "I have had to force stop this app. Lately, it has been chewing through my battery. I just checked my battery performance due to it falling way to fast. Apparently CovidSafe has been responsible for 35% of all my battery usage this charge. Unacceptable and must be fixed.",
        "Something seems to be seriously wrong with the current version. I was woken up this morning by my phone buzzing as it turned itself off due to 0% battery. It was 90%+ less than 7 hours ago. Battery manager shows it was the Covidsafe app that caused it. It has always hit my battery fairly hard but it's getting ridiculous now. (Update) Uninstalling, reinstalling, and clearing the cache seems to have helped. Next night I went from 100% to 83% in ~ 7 hrs.",
        "Since this update battery use has spiralled out of control. My average days shows this app uses 15% of my (Android) battery...and I haven't been out all day today. Even using many other apps and reading news etc my screen use is only 8% of daily use. I'll delete this app until battery drain can be fixed. I want to do the right thing but this is a major design fault.",
        "The recent 2.0 update seems to have done something to it's battery use. Judging from the feedback here, I'm not alone in noticing a marked increase in battery drain since the update. In my case, with Covidsafe on, the phone will no longer go on deep sleep/doze. It seems to have borked something with wakelocks. I adopted the app immediately on release and have repeatedly encouraged others to do the same, but in it's present state, I can no longer continue. One kludge I can think of is killing the process when not out and about, but that would require remembering to turn it back on again, which, let's face it, is a losing proposition.",
        "Like others are saying. I've been using it since it came out but am now uninstalling as my battery has been draining super fast the last several days. Just looked and saw its this app causing it. Came on here and saw others experiencing the same problem. So time to uninstall for me.",
        "WTH? Battery consumption has gone through the roof! Was never like this before. This app should have a QR code reader built in for venue check-ins. Then state governments could mandate it be used for all check-ins. That would get more people using it.",
        "Pain in the arse. Runs my battery flat at night so I turn it off. Forget to turn it on when I go out, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place. Also hard on the battery using location while running when I'm out and battery goes flat, also defeating the point of having it. I have a high end phone .. God help everyone else ... trying to do the right thing but really???? The QR system is 100 times better.",
        "Most recent update appears to disrupt other Bluetooth connections intermittently. Could be just coincidence but those problems started the same time as the 18 December release. Phone battery performance also seems to be adversely affected since that release.",
        "For what is worth, my Samsung phone is showing that the app has been operating in the background for 12 hours, zero minutes active, but used over 12% battery. I've only been out once to an un-crowded local supermarket (no one else at home). The app's never been like this before. I'll need to shut it until this battery demand situation changes.",
        "Solution for Battery drain- restart your phone. Had the batt drain issue. Emailed developer saying I'd uninstalled and why. They replied with a fair list of helpful info... including restart the phone as it resets something after a lot of Bluetooth handshakes...took my phone batt back to 30hrs from down to 18.",
        "Great idea. Originally I couldnt keep the app open on my Oppo phone but I finally solved it. I turned off all the battery saving features as described on the Covidsafe help page, but the missing link was on the open app page, you have to swipe down on Covidsafe to lock the app. This prevents Oppo's aggressive battery management from shutting it down.",
        "51% of my battery usage on my S10+. I've gone from 100% battery at 6.10am to 21% battery at 4.37pm and have been flat out at work all day, haven't read any Facebook notifications or anything. I'm uninstalling this, you can run another marketing campaign when you fix it.",
        "Joining the crowd of users experiencing very high battery consumption (and Bluetooth app crashes) with this update. Devs need to acknowledge this issue and not dismiss the battery issue as is currently occurring on the github page for the app. Will be uninstalling until resolved :(",
        "Been using the app since launch. Since the recent update, the battery drains very very quickly. On average, this app has been using 50% of my battery per charge although it is supposed to be running in the background with minimal battery power consumption.",
        "Please fix battery issue, I have to force stop app because of battery drain. I don't always remember to restart when needed so negates its usefulness. Consumption extremely high at 40% consumption compared to other high apps at around 3%. At very least it needs an on off switch to help to turnoff when not needed."
