        "content": "Samsung S9 I open and register with no problem. I open my shopping list (Google Keep) without closing the Services app and complete my shopping. I then try to switch to Services app and find it closed itself in the background. A number of times I was unaware of the need to check out due to that. With the app closing itself, check out requires I log in again, bring up the non-completed record and check out. That's inconvenient and, as I said already, a number of times I was unaware of the need to check out. Warn the user. Keep the app open until the user deliberately closes it. UPDATE: My Opinion hasn't changed. I want to use it because it gives me control but the Covid component is the source of much frustration. I like data off to preserve battery. If I forget to switch mobile data on before trying to register, I can't simply reverse out, switch on mobile data and start the app again. It remains unwilling to log me on. I failed to notice for a long time a link below the check out button would allow me to manually enter a time. Why not two buttons? Chats with other people indicate they are similarly frustrated by the app. If I watch, not a lot of people use it when entering places that have the QR code display. This includes people who have seen me log in. Overall. It takes too much time to achieve what should be fast log in and fast log out. I understand the need to have a drivers licence protected by other than phone security. It doesn't makes sense to frustrate people who would like to use the Covid component. Why not have components that require more security in a section that logs out quickly and the rest in a section that allows users to hold it open SO THE APP IS VISIBLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR SCREEN AND THEY DON'T FORGET TO LOG OUT. Sorry, getting frustrated here. If it is not improved soon I will join the hoards of people who don't bother",
