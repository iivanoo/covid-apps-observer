A couple more clicks to open the app and click 'Check In', and you'll need to go back to the front door and scan the QR code again from within the app. Unlike other quick and easy QR check ins, scanning the code from your camera will NOT simply open the app/site AND recognise the venue you're trying to check into. You have to realise the venue is using THIS app, open the app, then scan; OR scan, fiddle and scan again.",
