The Digital Driver Licence (DDL) appears in a large box on the top of the main page when you log in to Service NSW and it's not something that you want to see every time you log in. It needs to be under a heading (i.e.) like registrations. I can't even find my Boat Licence on Service NSW anymore, it's simply disappeared! Everything was great before i downloaded the DDL now it's just a very frustrating App!!",

        "content": "OK, I decided to see what all the fuss was about after the news announcements, so I installed the Service NSW app from Google Play. The newest reviews are pretty scathing, but I persisted. It installed. I ran it. It asked me to sign into my ServiceNSW account. I had to look that up because I hadn't needed to deal with it since paying my rego in April. It asked me to set a four digit pin and whether I wanted to use my fingerprint to unlock the app. YOU ARE NOT TAKING MY CHILD'S FINGERPRINT! So I said yes. I got in and the first thing that appeared was \"Get my Digital Driver's Licence\". A few seconds later, I had it! I also had a link to instantly see all my traffic fines and demerits (none for both of course) as well as my car rego details. And I got to see my digital licence. It's actually very clear and large (on my big phone), and the background waratah (or is it a lotus flower?) takes a little while to appear and changes colour occasionally. The QR code also pops up. If you refresh the screen by pulling down on it, the page reloads and you get a different QR code. When someone wants to verify your licence, they use the same Service NSW app and they choose to option to check a digital driver's licence. They scan your QR code with their app and it \"briefly\" displays your name and whether you are underage or not, so it doesn't show your D.O.B. or your address, which is good. All in all, I think it's a big improvement on the plastic one. Well done Gladys!",
