        "Good points: can manage appt bookings, can add other types of practioners for convenient access to their contact details. Bad point: If you log-out of the app you lose your Passcode access & have to do it again. I didn't see a warning for this quirk.",
        "Phone anxiety has always been a big obstacle to me booking necessary appointments, so having an alternative where I can see exactly which doctors are available and when without having to pick up the phone is a huge help.",
        "This app is brilliant, easy to book and cancel if needed. I can search appointment times easier to suit my busy work schedule.More doctors needs to be added to this system.",
        "For me personally this app has been easy to operate and has helpful navigation to book appointments, mark them on your calendar, cancel appointments etc. I highly recommend.",
        "Very happy with this app. Easy and excellent results immediately. Much easier than trying to get health practitioners reception.",
        "This app makes it so easy to book and keep track of appointments! Love it!",
        "A very easy app to book appointments without the hassle to wait on the phone.",
        "Nice and easy to book, alter, and cancel my appointments.",
        "This app is easy to use. Havent seen major issues with the app so far. Fast and ease of access",
        "This app is really useful to book any time for appointments. I love it \ud83d\ude01",
        "Easier than making the call to the centre. Takes less than a minute to book.",
        "12 months ago I enjoyed using this app. Now I wouldn't recommend it. It hasn't changed in style or context. And now I couldn't book my daughter online while ED doctor was doing their part with helping my daughter. I can't change appointments anymore and generally appears this app is now only worth to be deleted. \ud83d\ude2d",
        "It's great to be home or out shopping and go I need to see my favourite doctor Dr Jessica Ho.... just jump on mobile on health engine and booked in under 1 minute..... Love your work",
        "Easy to use app, great way to find and book doctor's appointments.",
        "Brilliant app, for prompt confirmation & appointment reminders",
        "Why do I need to get an SMS for verification? We get no mobile signal where I live and by the time I get somewhere to access the SMS, the code has expired. I've just about reached the point of ditching the app. It's s o frustrating that everyone just assumes that everyone else has mobile phone access!!",
        "The app is great I book all my appointments through it and have not had any problems as of yet. They are very professional and courteous at the front desk, the Dr I see is amazing and always listens to my concerns and addresses them with care and understanding.",
        "UPDATE ON REVIEW: After a bumpy March '21update caused appointment fail for my doc booking, I reported the problem and developer was attentive and gave advice. I will need to await my next booking before I can report it as fixed. Hope. Updated & failed.. what a shame the March '21 update caused the booking appointment service to become inactive. Texts with codes keep rolling in but setting an appointment time cannot be achieved. It used to work really well.",
        "Need to see my doctor but can't get in till ages when I call up, I get in quickly if I use the app but the update stuffed up the log in process and now I am stuck waiting. Already wrote a review and sent an email to developers but had no reply \ud83e\udd28 I think if you start an important app like this you have the responsibility to make sure it works and not literally stuff peoples lives around like your doing to me.",
        "Love this app, it is easy to book myself and my kids while i am at work. Although would love to get reasons as to why some doctors don't give reasons as to why they don't do bookings online when they use to.",
        "Again broken with new release. Logged me out. Wiped all my profiles saved. Everytime I go to main home screen, keeps spamming with SMS verification codes. Lots of issues. Also asks me to update with first card on Ehime even though I have updated. Terrible update!",
        "Can't login as app is stuck at verify mobile number. Clicking next does nothing",
        "Doctors are friendly and professional. Bulk billing assists everyone. Clean and tidy waiting area. Unfortunately, the wait time for your appointment has increased significantly. 1:10pm turned into 1:45pm waiting.",
        "It's so handy to be able to make your own appointments anytime of the day or night with your preferred doctors and add it straight to calendar. Love this app!",
        "I love this app, it makes it so much easier to book a doctors appointment, you can see what times are available and pick one.",
        "I use it regularly to make appointments with my doctor. It is so easy to use.",
        "This aap is easy to use and it stands out amongst my other apps so I can spot it in no time. I love it and highly recommend it. Just give it a try and the rest will be a history.",
        "Super easy to use. And convenient being able to book my appointments any time of the day or night.",
        "So easy to use! Booked in less then a minute, and easier to see times available for your doctor.",
        "There is a graphic which says \"time to update your app\" which when tapped takes us to Play Store where there is no update... stop wasting our time with this click bait... was the $2.9M fine not enough of a deterrence for misleading users...",
        "Just easy to use ,makes my doc visits much easier!",
        "Constant sms verification is insane, got a response to update to 7.8.1 but only 7.8 shows for me.",
        "Very friendly, they explain things to you. Very helpful, would recommend them to everyone.",
        "Great practice, brilliant caring doctors who are very thorough and they really do care about you. I moved to another suburb , but still more than happy to travel nearly an hour, to see my doctors.",
        "So easy to use. I like being able to book appointments when it suits me. Not having to wait until the next working day.",
        "This app used to be great. Now I can't even book on it and I get sms's for absolutely no reason.",
        "Absolutely love this app it saves me time just to book online for my appt n it's convenient for me to use",
        "Very convenient and useful, so easy to use.",
        "Love the app! Found the best and my new family doctor. Easy to have doctors details on hand and make bookings with reminders",
