        "The app is great I book all my appointments through it and have not had any problems as of yet. They are very professional and courteous at the front desk, the Dr I see is amazing and always listens to my concerns and addresses them with care and understanding.",
        "12 months ago I enjoyed using this app. Now I wouldn't recommend it. It hasn't changed in style or context. And now I couldn't book my daughter online while ED doctor was doing their part with helping my daughter. I can't change appointments anymore and generally appears this app is now only worth to be deleted. \ud83d\ude2d",
        "UPDATE ON REVIEW: After a bumpy March '21update caused appointment fail for my doc booking, I reported the problem and developer was attentive and gave advice. I will need to await my next booking before I can report it as fixed. Hope. Updated & failed.. what a shame the March '21 update caused the booking appointment service to become inactive. Texts with codes keep rolling in but setting an appointment time cannot be achieved. It used to work really well.",
        "Again broken with new release. Logged me out. Wiped all my profiles saved. Everytime I go to main home screen, keeps spamming with SMS verification codes. Lots of issues. Also asks me to update with first card on Ehime even though I have updated. Terrible update!",
        "Love this app, it is easy to book myself and my kids while i am at work. Although would love to get reasons as to why some doctors don't give reasons as to why they don't do bookings online when they use to.",
        "So easy to use! Booked in less then a minute, and easier to see times available for your doctor.",
        "There is a graphic which says \"time to update your app\" which when tapped takes us to Play Store where there is no update... stop wasting our time with this click bait... was the $2.9M fine not enough of a deterrence for misleading users...",
        "Love the app! Found the best and my new family doctor. Easy to have doctors details on hand and make bookings with reminders",
        "Always quick and easy to make appointments, very happy with the app, would highly recommend",
        "This app is Awesome quick and easy to set up with your preferred care team and even easier to book your appointments",
        "Was an amazing and helpful app.Now it is the most useless app on the internet. Im not feeling well and its a sunday, i know my GP is popular but its ok. I have this app and can make an appointment so i dont miss out. NOPE!!!! The app doesnt allow me to make appointments on weekends anymore. So instead i cant sleep tonight out of stress. I will hsve roughly 60 sec when they start answering calls to try and gain one of 5 appointments i can see visible. If i miss out i spend days in pain.",
        "Never had a problem with this app. Love that it stores my info for easy booking.",
        "Text automatically redirected me to this app, meaning while already only just in time for an appointment I had to download this on data, login to my password manager, login to this, create a passcode, and then lookup my appointment before realising the app booked me to the wrong medical center...I'm sure its a good app but why is it necessary to go through this process every time I want to do something these days? Answer: It shouldn't be, fix your $hit.",
        "The app is easy to use and generally very useful. The addition of being able to add the scheduled appointment to Google Calendar has proven useful. Also fixed the DOB entry method. It is much easier. If I get a recall that says \"select Results in the appointment type\" but there is no \"Results\" type so I have to pick \"General appointment\". Also when checking a recall notice online you have to verify your date of birth with a calendar.",
        "I have been using this app for a while and it is so much better and quicker than contacting the medical practice via phone. Possible improvements: it would be great if there was a way to communicate through the app with the medical clinic to request longer appointments for example. It would also be handy to be able to change the type of appointment, for example changing from a standard consultation to a tlehealth one.",
        "Always friendly and excellent service, they all take the time to listen to you ...",
        "Great app easy to use... Good for last minute appointments as well..",
        "I can use it to book appointments quickly and easily and save my details as well as the clinics and practitioners I want, meaning that booking an appointment takes less than a minute. Very convenient and easy to use.",
        "Saves me so much hassle, have anxiety so having to call to make an appointment just aint easy",
        "What a fantastic app! Thank goodness for it as I had no credit on my phone but I had data so was able to download the app and make an appointment all within 5 minutes! Very impressive \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",
        "Pretty good. It's a shame that the Dr surgery can delete appointment when they want to without telling you. But it still comes up as you still have an appointment That part I don't like.",
        "Stopped using this app, my mobile number changed and I cannot change it online or through the app. Can no longer access to app due to access to sms otp. I cannot access app without otp and don't use app enough to waist time calling support to update my phone number.",
        "I don't book a doctors appt without this app. So easy to use. Love it.",
        "Very easy to use and it's very efficient to book your appointments. The only downfall is that not all doctors / service providers are on it, so you may not be able to book.",
        "So easy to book my appointments online. It registers on their systems instantly.",
        "No longer able to complete online bookings since the latest update.",
        "Easy and quick booking. Easy to navigate.",
        "Does exactly what it says it will. Simple and user friendly. More efficient than phone bookings which somehow seem to get lost st times.",
        "If you have more than one doctor, this app is really helpful. It assists me in keeping track of my appointments with various specialists, and I have their clinic contact details at my fingertips whenever I need them.",
        "no hassle, a very easy app for making your doctors appointment.",
        "Made making appointments so easy and the service is great",
        "Thanks for your reply however there is no further update available to me. I have tried opening it again and, after a brief pause, it is now working again. Thank you",
        "Easy to use and a variety of health professionals which is great...",
        "Very easy to use. Because it shows all the appointment times available it gives users flexibility to organise their day. Extremely useful.",
        "Easy to book and cancel appt! Great app.",
        "Easy to use and happy with simple things",
        "Works well, some mirror problems. These are other patient problems. Booking and not showing. Doctor now rings to confirm. This in itself makes the system a wast of time, I might as well just ring.",
        "The app is straight forward and simple to use. I like the convenience of booking appointments at any time (before I forget to).",
        "Excellent app that streamlines setting Health care appointments",
        "Easy to make appointments instead of being place on hold on the phone due to receptionist being too busy"
