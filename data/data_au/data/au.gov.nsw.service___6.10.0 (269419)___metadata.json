        "Recent update has broken everything. My license is no longer visible and I can't re-link it to my account. I enter me email and after a minute it says \"Something went wrong\". Whats the point of pushing people to use the app when it does not work? Makes me wonder if this is the quality of the programming being applied to protect our personal information. Disappointing.",
        "Went to use the app and I was no longer signed in Went to sign saying wrong password even though it was not So anyway I proceeded to change my password to sign back in after jumping through hoops I couldn't get a new password as it kept reverting back to one of the stages in the process to get a new password .Like so many things the government does and doesn't work this is just one of them",
        "On library advice for covid safe, tried setup new account, discov already had account. Attempts to login slowed by p/w issues. Finally accessed, but got error saying \"details mismatch\". Accepted req to get emailed ident code. Code didnt arrive after 2 tries, then threatened with lockout. Half hour time wasted, still have to sort out over phone. Wont be using app to use library. Stress & wasted time - for what?",
        "Tried to set up an account and after it not recognising my email address I was finally able to set a password Once i tried to log in it would recognised my password and now after changing my password a \"problem occours\" when i set my pin Works for most people but some of my friends I've spoken to have had the same issues with it being buggy to the point of not working",
        "I dont know whats going on with the nsw service app. Login through app , its said incorrect email address or password. I login through google chrome with exact details, its accepted. Something clearly broken and service nsw seems does not know what, keep asking screenshot from previous reviewer.",
        "The app has generally been good to use, however it is slow to recognise a fingerprint or pin & it also has an abnormally high battery usage, draining around 17% each day after just a check-in or two.",
        "On my Samsung galaxy j8 the Digital scanner not was working, despite reinstall and numerous logging-in attempts. However after this was brought to the attention of the developer an updated version was released which seems to have solved the problem!",
        "I changed email address for my services ap to new email and updated all details but since then my pin to log into services ap will not work. I am asked to change my pin, by logging in which I can do. I change the pin get message that says it has successfully changed my pin but then when I log out and try to log in with pin it does not work. I have tried clearing ap cache, clearing ap data, restarting my phone, changing time setting and constantly get message that my new pin is incorrect. Help",
        "App is generally ok to use except the pin login is slow. Unfortunately it uses all my battery just for a few covid check ins so is unfunctional while on the move. I will have to delete amd revert to web browser",
        "Won't log in... can log into the website after several resets but won't recognise the new passwords... very annoying, especially as we are encouraged to use it all the time.",
        "Services are occasionally unavailable, but this app is very easy to use and great to have these services in one central location",
        "I can login using a mobile browser but not the app. My email and password is correct and its not letting me log in. Any suggestions, its really frustrating",
        "painful does not register gmail phone number password bloody disgrace 5/5/21 update appears to work as it should will maybe increase to 5 star wait and see.",
        "Tried to log in and it keeps saying my code is wrong when it isn't. I have the latest version and still the same",
        "*Nothing changed, I still can't get into this app. Haven't heard from anyone. Have given all info I can. Very frustrating as it keeps saying my email is not valid when logging in and when I try to create an account, it says that email already in use. Can't get in at all. I've uninstalled and re installed, I've checked local time on clock. Don't know what else to do",
        "Edited: Yes, changing the time to automatic network settings worked. Odd but there you go. Cheers! \u2753\u2753\u2753\u2753\u2753 Frustrating! Keeps saying password incorrect (I can login on the website with it, I even changed it just in case, no go), keeps glitching, does not update properly... Driving me batty! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f",
        "Issues with checking in to places. Wherever is the first place in the day that I check in for, it will continually keep checking me in to the same place despite me scanning a different QR Code. And before you ask, yes I have the most up-to-date version and yes I have un-installed and then re-installed many times. What's the point if you can't even develop the app to work properly.",
        "Thank you for your response, but what I meant was all the categories are visible, only the bottom half of each category label is visible, they have no top. Why would the app only work properly on a mobile and not a tablet? Android and iOS both operate on mobile phones and tablets. Some tablets can make phone calls. The feedback section does not work on either phone or tablet. Also, it would be nice if the screen could be rotated.",
        "*Edit* Issue has now been fixed. Thanks for your swift response.** This App is frustrating. I was able to access it until the covid check ins. Now I can't get into my account. I can log into my account through web access but not through this app. I've used the same credentials to log into the App but it says my password is incorrect. I've reset several times only to realise it's the app that's the issue. Because of this issue, I can't even (Covid) check into any places.",
        "The Service NSW app is extremely disappointing. I agree totally with the comments below. It was excellent the first couple of times that I used it. Since then I have experienced all of the comments below. It no longer recognises my pin, the long way wouldn't let me proceed past the dependants question etc. The guy where I was going said to forget it as lots of people had the same problems as me. I rang and was advised to update which I did. I am going to forget it.",
        "This app drove me crazy because I could not log in after countless password resets, uninstalling and reinstalling, and because the QR codes for check ins default to the app I couldn't check in anywhere. I had all the same issues as the person below me, it was a nightmare. Based on the Service NSW response below I checked my phone time settings. It was already set to Sydney/NSW time. I had to switch it to auto detect the network provider's time. That solved it. So frustrating.",
        "Not impressed at all so far. Just logging in is a hassle as it tells me I've used the wrong email or password even though I've used the same credentials before. The same thing happens every time so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I was able to log in after that but then I tried to redeem one of the Dine & Discover vouchers today for the first time and when the venue scanned the QR code, it came up as invalid. Not happy Jan",
        "I tried to login but always app said to me wrong email address and password. But I can login easily on website but can't login on NSW APP, I don't understand. I am using Android version 11 , please fixed it on Android 11 version. Many Thanks in Advance Warm Regards IME KING",
        "Delivers a lot of good service, but also falls short in a lot of ways. Istill have intermittant issues with logging in which is annoying. The notification to sign out, while great in principle, simply reminds you to sign out regardless of whether you already have. As someone who has to go to multiple businesses in a row, results in completely useless notifications most of the time and results in less effective real use. Could also stand to have a temporily offline mode.",
        "Terrible! I was trying to check in but it said some message about not being able to log in ever again. I haven't used the app for about a month and this is what I come back to. To fix this problem, I had to restart my phone (which didn't work), and than reinstalled the app which worked but I had to remember my password \ud83d\ude24 Then, when I tried to checkout, it wouldn't let me so I had to close the app completely and then it worked. Very annoying!",
        "UPDATE: yes I worked that out eventually. Your error handling/messages could easily have prevented this, and made clear there was an outage. Look at all the other reviews where people were unnecessarily resetting their passwords. *Moreover* design thinking - login is totally unnecessary for interactions like covid sign in! Lol. Update has broken login. Fingerprint no longer unlocks and asks for PIN, which then says I've got the wrong PIN. Hahaha, nope. Your app is broken, well done. Now fix it!",
        "I have not been able to successfully use this to check in to venues. I use to be able to when going through the webpage (using the mobile) however, now that I have the app on the phone it does not allow me to proceed. States to try again later, I do so many times and it still doesn't go ahead. Using Android phone.",
        "Surely the Covid check out reminder should only remind you 2 hours after you check into a venue IF you haven't already checked out. What's the point of sending you a reminder to check out when you have already checked out. The net result is nuisance notifications which in turn get turned off leading to a missed opportunity to deliver meaningful advice.",
        "Good App. But QLD app for QR Code is better , QLD government sign in System enables you to create QR codes for different venues belong to one ABN & Address while only change the venue name/discreption which make sense if you own large site with multiple venues belong to the same address & ABN. sorry that's made me feel jealous of QLD \ud83d\ude0a.",
        "Scanning into premises, the app frequently fails to register the correct location. As often as not it instead displays previous location. Have reported this major bug numerous times, yet its still not fixed. My bug reports have not even been acknowledged. What a joke.",
        "The check in doesn't work properly... Once you've checked in and then attempt to check out it goes to he original check in again? Making me check in at the time I want to check out therefore deeming this function unusable... Fix this glitch... Also I've noticed that when you've checked out from one place and checked in to a new place it just references this back to the previous place?? Quite frustrating really....",
        "Can't login with my correct credentials recently, including fingerprint. I can login to the Service NSW website though. Clearly the app is broken at the moment. Reinstall did not fix. EDIT: Make sure your time and date is set to automatic on your phone or the login won't work even if the time is correct.",
        "Very useful app making it easy to access some essential things. The developers address reported bugs very quickly which is great. Just a suggestion, althought knowing all the different departments in the government it might be impossible. I'd love to be able to have my trade licence, NDIS worker check and even JP qualification showing in the app.",
        "I am unable to add digital fishing licence to the app. When trying to add it, app gets stuck in the page Link To Account. Update: This is now working fine after the update. I had also removed the service from the website and added it back on the app and it was all good.",
        "Has worked fine until a few days ago, it has logged me out and says 'incorrect email or password'. I have reset my password, uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous time but nothing fixes the issue. I can log onto the Service NSW website with no problems, so the password is not the problem, it is a glitch with the app",
        "Have the dine and discover, you need to use ID but for whatever reason photo ID card is not accepted at all. What is the point of having the photo ID card if NOTHING accepts it as a from of ID? I will never drive, my passport is expired and my birth certificate is hidden for safe keeping. I find it stupid that it's not accepted as a form of ID at all",
        "Frustrating, took five goes to get acceptance for the vouchers. I finally got the go ahead & that I would receive a email with the vouchers. I did & was able to download them on the computer, but on the service app. the vouchers do not appear...just says let's get started. Annoying. Will try that site for help",
        "I was so excited to be able to have a digital drivers licence in my phone! Just called Services NSW and spoke to the great call centre staff. Unfortunately the app (and site) are down so I am unable to log in to the app or access my digital licence. The system issues should be resolved soon. I don't recommend using this app for now - it's more reliable to just carry the card. Hopefully the app will be improved and have an offline feature in the future.",
        "Can't log in on phones with aftermarket firmware. The app says this is for security reasons, but as a professional software developer, I assure you this is security theatre. There is nothing insecure about running apps on aftermarket firmware unless the app itself is insecure, which raises concerns about the security of the Service NSW app.",
        "Had this app on previous phone have a later model phone operating system android 5.1 trying to download on new phone told that app can not be downloaded due to operating system not being 6+. Have enormous problem understanding why a later phone model is not compatible. I now have no app other QR apps I do not trust and don't work the same way so I am now not complying with Gov request??????????"
