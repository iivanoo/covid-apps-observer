For the past few weeks we have had to recharge our phones at least every 36-48 hours, whereas previously we only needed to recharge every 3-4 days. To prove that the CovidSafe app is the problem, we fully charged both phones and turned the app off on one. The phone with the app turned off maintained charge for double the time of the phone running the app, with roughly identical call and other app usage. (I wait to see if removing the app will restore previously-reliable operation of Android Auto in my Honda Civic which has had blue tooth interference since an Android update on 1 December.)",

The support people say it uses between 1% and 2% of battery per hour. That multiplies out to between 24% and 48% per 24 hour period. That's very significant battery drain. In balance, is a flat battery and unusable phone worth the possibly minimal contact tracing utility? Suggestions: reduce the battery drain and convince us that it has some utility",

Judging from the feedback here, I'm not alone in noticing a marked increase in battery drain since the update. In my case, with Covidsafe on, the phone will no longer go on deep sleep/doze. It seems to have borked something with wakelocks. I adopted the app immediately on release and have repeatedly encouraged others to do the same, but in it's present state, I can no longer continue. One kludge I can think of is killing the process when not out and about, but that would require remembering to turn it back on again, which, let's face it, is a losing proposition.",

It continually pops up notifications telling me it's not connected because my Location isn't open when it clearly is. I've also now noticed that even though I have selected Auto Update so I will get the most recent numbers it's not updating either. Example: NSW has been showing most recent number as 14 new cases for days & I had just seen the Premier's speech for today & we have 4 new cases. Even allowing for 24hour turnaround that is still wrong. I'll be interested to see homuch longer we are consistently getting 14 new cases per day. C'mon techs we expect much better than this when you pushed so hard for everyone to download this app. There's no point in having it that I can see. If anyone knows a Web page that simply gives current updates per area searched please help me as I'm in the very high risk category & would like to be aware if/when there's new cases to be aware of. Thanks everyone it sure looks to me like the online community will be more help to me than the official govt app at this point. Unless of course they put the effort in to have it work properly because short of a miracle we are stuck with this virus for the forseeable future &ppossibly beyond.",
