        "Never have an issue booking appointments. So easy to use with an option to save to you calander. Clear display of all available appointment time to suit. Heaps of associated health care providers to pick from to suit your time and location. Use this app every single time. No issues. Thanks for making my life easier. Highly recommended. Cheers, Q.",
        "Easy to book appointments, but some of the repetition asked everytime you book seems to negate the reason for setting up a profile. Saving a Dr and choosing the place shows no times. Doing it the other way around works??? Also Why confirm my appointment by SMS, and tell me to use the app in that SMS if the app can't confirm appointments?",
        "Fantastic GP, however because he likes to take his time with patients is always behind schedule. But we do wait because he has been great for us. Really like this app because it's quick and easy to make appointments and whilst having 4 children is sometimes hard to make phone calls.",
        "Easy to use. You can take your time and choose the best time for you without feeling like you're asking the receptionist a million questions. I just wish more practices would sign up!",
        "Easy and convenient to navigate between different apt options. Easy filters for searches. Since covid19 it displays doctor offices that are way too far away",
        "Love this app. Saves me having to waste time trying to search the net or the white pages.",
        "Great for making appointments, would good if had more options, ie viewing results; requesting scripts. I used one in NZ that could do all that",
        "Used to be ok now lets you get to adding your name / dob and won't move to next page - obviously not compatible with Samsung Tab 6/ 7 tablets, just broken or not tested properly.",
        "Very good app I have everything at my fingertips in regards to health care.",
        "Very helpful and gets chance to know understand Hospitals and Doctors... For some doctors full details are not updated. That will helpful if u ensure updated.",
        "Easy to book appointments, particularly with my gp as they have a whole booking system based online. Every time I go in to book I'm logged out of the app, though. Maybe it's because I only use it every few months or more, but it's a bit of a pain having to login every time I'm sick which doesn't happen all that often. Not a big issue, and probably a security thing but would be nice to stay signed",
        "Love the new layout, for easy to find practices.",
        "Very easy to go thru different stages, happy with it .",
        "Easy and friendly to use and sure beats trying to call up at 8am trying to get an appointment.",
        "Excellent app, saves time and the info you want is there. Brilliant.",
        "Well, it works, sometimes I need to confirm with the dr surgery, between tele and physical but overall, it saves some of the hassle, and you can see what appointments are actually available, been using for a couple of years, and helps as I have anxiety at times unable to call",
        "Easy to use and great resourse especially for those cannot wait appointments.",
        "It's not working now I had to uninstall and reinstall and it still doesn't have my gp on the app I've all ways booked on there but it's not working ITS WORONGARY MEDICAL CENTER I HAVE ALWAYS BOOKED THROUGH YOUR APP",
        "Booking an appointment is quick and easy and you can pick a time that suits you.",
        "I have a couple of health conditions that require fortnightly ongoing GP visits. This app helps me to keep my appointments on track. I am a very busy person so it also helps me to keep things organised for my family. 05/09/2020 It is 3am and I remembered that I need to make a Doctors appmt, Health Engine to the rescue! I am not limited by business hours, I don't have to hold waiting for busy reception staff, I just go to the Health Engine app and it takes around a minute to book in an appmt.",
        "One of the best app to book your appointment with the doctor. It's too easy to operate and does not take even a minute to book your appointment. You have to add your personal information one time then you don't provide your personal details again. Next time you just click your name and everything pop up.",
        "Used this frequently until a couple of months ago - now I can't book an appointment anymore. When I go to make a booking, and get to the stage of selecting a type/practitioner/time it just keeps loading and never shows any times. I've reinstalled multiple times and still no luck. Please fix.",
        "This app is so good to make appointment and do video calls so easy when u can't talk or have sick kids",
        "Very handy, especially when going to Doctors regularly.",
        "I have never had an issue when using thia app to book an appointment and it makes life easier for me as I don't always have time to make a phonecall. It is also very handy when I need to book an appointment at night time in order to see our gp the next day.",
        "Much better since you updated the update! Much clearer and easy to use.",
        "My first time using this app. Not familiar with it. Cannot delete one of the profile on my list (even though I am able to delete another one) If I am able to choose GP from a drop down list that would be great. Then I don't have to go thru many GP with their available date and time shown.",
        "The staff and doctors are very nice, always on time never had any problems.",
        "Well designed and executed app with smooth, pleasant and intuitive GUI. No obtrusive or non-relevant advertising. Useful suggestions of other services with links to such. Well done, devs!",
        "very convenient. i booked on a Saturday when they were closed. i will use it from now on. thank you.",
        "So handy can book any time anywhere, especially with sick kids.",
        "Easy to book especially when the surgery is not open.",
        "I rely on HealthEngine to make my appointments. It used to work but even update it doesn't load after I select my clinic and often forces close and stops working so it's useless. Please fix.",
        "Easy and simple. I made the appointments for the whole family through this app.",
        "Very easy and convenient. Highly recommended!",
        "Easy to use. Freely and easy to understand.",
        "Why does it keep asking for Medicare card info to be input every single time I make a booking when it's already been saved in the profile? VERY annoying when I just want to make a booking quickly.",
        "Fantastic app! I have been using this a since it first started and I have never had an issue with booking any of my appointments.",
        "App is ok but need to be able to check time, date and which pratictioner I am seeing. Does not show and txt msg just a reminder you have an appointment no time only a doctor. Time reminder would ui I'd be an excellent reminder.",
        "Works great, but the \"add to calendar\" functionality is broken at the moment, although it worked in the past."
