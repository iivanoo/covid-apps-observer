## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write to external storage.

> COVID-19.eus es una aplicación colaborativa para gestionar la pandemia del COVID-19 en el ámbito de la comunidad autónoma vasca. La aplicación permite hacer un autodiagnóstico del contagio de COVID-19. En caso de ser positivo, el usuario se considerará POSIBLE contagio (según terminología de la OMS) y avisará a todo el cículo de personas, de tal forma que se considerarán en riesgo.
<br>Junto a esta información el sistema registrará ese dato, de tal forma que se puede seguir un rastro de contagios con esta funcionalidad de círculos. Junto con esta información, se pide el Código Postal, y en caso de infección comunitaria, se podrían también detectar focos de contagio.
<br>Esta información se utilizará para el análisis y el estudio epidemiológico.

### Description
> El Departamento de Políticas Digitales y Administración Pública ha puesto en marcha ConfinApp, una aplicación que nace con la voluntad de convertirse en la herramienta de referencia para la ciudadanía para gestionar la fase de confinamiento y postconfinamiento.
<br>ConfinApp pretende ser un acompañamiento y la puerta de entrada a toda la información y servicios que el Gobierno de Cataluña pone a disposición de la ciudadanía, autónomos y empresas durante y después del confinamiento.
<br>Una de las principales funcionalidades es un asistente virtual basado en inteligencia artificial (IA), orientado a dar respuesta a las principales inquietudes o dudas que esta crisis genera entre la ciudadanía, desde aspectos relacionados con las medidas de higiene y salud ; los desplazamientos permitidos y prohibidos durante el Estado de Alarma; certificados y trámites administrativos; coberturas de seguros; aspectos tributarios; ayudas y medidas de apoyo a trabajadores, empresas y autónomos; dudas sobre el curso escolar, etc. Un asistente cognitivo que interactúa con los ciudadanos.
<br>ConfinApp incorpora, además del asistente, otras funcionalidades como la generación del certificado autorresponsable de desplazamiento en formato digital descargable, la posibilidad de adjuntar el certificado de empresas de servicios esenciales para los desplazamientos de las personas trabajadoras y un test de velocidad de conexión a Internet del usuario para conocer el estado de la conexión e identificar posibles incidencias.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Generalitat de Catalunya |
| **Website**  | [http://politiquesdigitals.gencat.cat/ca/pgov_ambits_d_actuacio/administraciodigital/confinapp/](http://politiquesdigitals.gencat.cat/ca/pgov_ambits_d_actuacio/administraciodigital/confinapp/) |
| **Email** | mobilitat.ctti@gencat.cat |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Generalitat+de+Catalunya](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Generalitat+de+Catalunya) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **com.google.android.c2dm.permission<br>RECEIVE** | - | - 
 **com.google.android.finsky.permission<br>BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE** | - | -

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Generalitat Valenciana |
| **Website**  | [http://www.gva.es](http://www.gva.es) |
| **Email** | responde-app@gva.es |
| **Physical address**  | [Calle Democracia, Nº 77 Valencia (España)  CP: 46018](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Calle%20Democracia,%20Nº%2077%20Valencia%20(España)%20CP:%2046018) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6787972071287437379](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6787972071287437379) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

### Description
> Aplicación móvil oficial de la Conselleria de Sanitat Universal i Salut Pública para solicitar cita con tu centro de salud en caso de presentar síntomas clínicos compatibles con infección por COVID-19.
<br>A través de la APP también se puede acceder a una amplia información sobre la infección causada por coronavirus COVID-19. 
<br>Los síntomas compatibles con infección por COVID-19 son síntomas de infección de vías respiratorias, estando presente uno o más de los siguientes: 
<br>- fiebre (más de 37º)
<br>- tos
<br>- estornudos
<br>- dolor de garganta 
<br>- dificultad respiratoria
<br>Si se han presentado estos síntomas en los últimos 14 días debes solicitar la cita mediante esta App.
<br>Si los síntomas que padeces revisten gravedad o tienes una emergencia llama al teléfono 112.
<br>Las citas a través de esta App están dirigidas a los casos posibles de infección COVID-19.

<br>Si durante la primera llamada telefónica el profesional sanitario de tu centro de salud identifica tu caso como posible de COVID-19, el resto de citas telefónicas para efectuar el seguimiento de tu caso serán programadas por el profesional sanitario. A partir de ese momento, recibirás llamadas periódicas para verificar tu estado de salud y ayudarte en todas las dudas y necesidades que puedas presentar.
<br>Si presentas otros síntomas diferentes a los indicados, ponte en contacto con tu centro de salud a través de los teléfonos de cita previa habituales. 
<br>La Conselleria de Sanidad Universal y salud Pública  es la responsable y autora de la información que se muestra en la aplicación, además, garantiza la privacidad y protección de tus datos (http://coronavirusautotest.san.gva.es/proteccion-datos-es.html). Asimismo, la Conselleria garantiza que se almacenará y utilizará la información personal de un modo suficientemente seguro, durante el tiempo necesario y solo para proporcionarte los servicios personalizados anteriormente descritos.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Generalitat Valenciana |
| **Website**  | [http://infocoronavirus.gva.es/](http://infocoronavirus.gva.es/) |
| **Email** | appsanitatcoronavirus@gva.es |
| **Physical address**  | [Calle Democracia, Nº 77 Valencia (España)  CP: 46018](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Calle%20Democracia,%20Nº%2077%20Valencia%20(España)%20CP:%2046018) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets.

> Estupenda. Si además la combinas con la de pedir cita con tu médico habitual en cuanto la usas te aparece una cita telefónica con una enfermera, que te dará cita para la pcr por teléfono. A mí me funcionó estupendamente, rápida y sencilla de usar.

Es de seguimiento, luego si no has tenido síntomas, pues no la uses (para ver el mapa de covid que piden muchos esta la web y el chatbot).

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Me iba a bajar la aplicación, pero leyendo las reseñas no es que anime mucho, la verdad... De todas formas, habría que ver si los problemas que describe la gente en las reseñas de no notificación se deben a que no llevan activo el bluetooth o a que no meten el código. Si, por el contrario, es por error de la aplicación o porque no dan el código en el hospital, arregladlo, por favor. Me parece una app muy útil, pero para eso, tanto usuarios como administradores, debemos estar atentos.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:20:52__

> El concepto de la aplicación es muy bueno, pero la puesta en marcha sin la coordinación necesaria, ni voluntad, ni medios dedicados de las administraciones públicas de este país han hecho que la desinstale por ineficaz. He tenido un caso de Covid cercano con la aplicación instalada y nadie le ha facilitado el código necesario para activar la utilidad de esta aplicación.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 12:28:22__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | DKV Servicios |
| **Website**  | [https://dkvseguros.es](https://dkvseguros.es) |
| **Email** | aplicaciones@dkvservicios.com |
| **Physical address**  | [TORRE DKV, AVDA. MARIA ZAMBRANO, 31 CP: 50.018 ZARAGOZA.](https://www.google.com/maps/search/TORRE%20DKV,%20AVDA.%20MARIA%20ZAMBRANO,%2031%20CP:%2050.018%20ZARAGOZA.) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br><b>MÓDULO DE NIVEL DE DOLOR</b>
<br>Esta es la primera aplicación validada científicamente y que ha publicado los resultados de la validación en la prestigiosa revista científica JMIR, número 1 en la categoría de "digital health", con un factor de impacto de 4,945 sobre 5. Más información: https://www.jmir.org/2020/2/e13468/
<br>Nuestro equipo ha desarrollado una versión moderna de la Visual Analogue Scala (pVAS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale), denominada Electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS). La aplicación permite al usuario registrar el nivel de dolor a través de su dispositivo.
<br><b>MÓDULO DE ACTIVIDAD FÍSICA</b>
<br>El módulo de actividad física permite obtener las métricas calorías consumidas, minutos de ejercicio y nivel de sedentarismo. Estas métricas permiten ver la evolución de la actividad física día a día y combinadas con los datos de nivel de glucosa en sangre permiten a los especialistas hacer un seguimiento detallado de la evolución de la diabetes de tipo 2.
<br>Estudios recientes demuestran que la actividad física ayuda a controlar el nivel de glucosa en sangre. Junto con la dieta, el ejercicio físico es uno de los pilares fundamentales de la prevención y el tratamiento de diabetes de tipo 2. A través de esta aplicación usted podrá monitorear su nivel de actividad física y también ayudar a los profesionales de la salud en el seguimiento del tratamiento.
<br><b>ATENCIÓN</b>
<br>	• La aplicación NO proporciona una interpretación médica de ninguno de los valores registrados a través de los diferentes módulos
<br>	• La aplicación NO proporciona ningún tipo de consulta directa o indirecta con médicos ni ningún consejo sanitario relacionado con la salud. Además, no proporciona ningún informe médico que pueda informar o desinformar erróneamente los usuarios en cualquier aspecto de su salud.
<br>	• La aplicación NO proporciona ni comparte información con ningún médico ni nadie sobre el progreso de cualquier resultado por parte del usuario. Sólo si el usuario consiente conectar la aplicación con el sitio web interactiveclinics.com, un posible entrenador personal o un profesional de la salud puede observar la información que el usuario haya decidido compartir. El entrenador personal o profesional de la salud pueden enviar al usuario un texto breve mediante una notificación con el objetivo de motivar al usuario a alcanzar los diferentes objetivos.
<br>Disfrute mientras cuida de su salud!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Bit Genoma Digital Solutions SL |
| **Website**  | [https://interactiveclinics.com](https://interactiveclinics.com) |
| **Email** | hello@interactiveclinics.com |
| **Physical address**  | [Prim 26, 08911 Badalona](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prim%2026,%2008911%20Badalona) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bit+Genoma+Digital+Solutions+SL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bit+Genoma+Digital+Solutions+SL) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.1.0 (API level 27) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Soy médico. No conozco el algoritmo diagnóstico que hay detrás de la aplicación por lo que no opinaré sobre él. Pero la implementación es realmente mala. La mitad de las consultas que he hecho de prueba con diferentes cuadros clínicos no han sido capaces de arrojar un resultado final, ya que se cuelga y te devuelve a la pantalla principal. No admite multitarea y cuando te llaman o sales a otra aplicación en medio del proceso se borra todo. Sus resultados finales no son tampoco demasiado útiles, en el fondo es una forma un poco más elaborada de lograr que contactes con los médicos que tienen en cuadro (y pagues, claro). No la recomiendo.<br> :date: __2019-08-13 17:33:47__

> La app de verdad promete mucho, la apariencia es buena y el cuestionario es muy bueno, pero se detiene a cada rato, llevo usándola 10 minutos y se me ha detenido como 9 veces ya, y tengo que comenzar de nuevo a responder todo, no le pongo las 5 porque no está cumpliendo con lo que esta diseñada, arreglen eso y todo fino<br> :date: __2014-09-20 22:22:10__

> El app es bueno pero tiene que correjirse algunas funciones.  - Depasiadas preguntas. - No hace mixturas de diagnosticos Ejm. Dolor de cabeza seguido de vomitos y mareos picazón en el pie derecho. Solo analiza un diagnosticos y lo demas sintomas no lo toma en cuenta. - Cuando analiza el sintoma su respuesta es el diagnostico de la patologia te envia a google pero el problema es cuando hace clic con la dedo no se puede ver el contenido de la patologia por el google.<br> :date: __2014-05-19 08:35:06__

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Muy buena y útil si vives en Galicia. Lo que más me ha gustado es que están bien explicadas y organizadas las restricciones por concello con datos actualizados y oficiales de la propia Xunta. No hay información más actualizada y veraz que esta. Además si tu resultado es positivo aquí te mostrará tu código para introducir en Radar Covid, a parte de hacer listas con contactos estrechos o declarar un contacto de riesgo para que te hagan la prueba entre otras funciones.

> A app e estupenda para informarte de todas as limitacións do teu concello pero o día dos cambios de normas tarda moito en actualizar. Eu prefiroa en vez da páxina da Xunta porque e máis rápida incluindo o teu concello. Polo demais noraboa porque e moito mellor e mais específica que a app nacional.

> Aparte de lo invasiva que resulta (llama la atención porque la propone el partido que acusaba a Radar Covid de serlo), cuando quiero introducir el QR de algún establecimiento resulta que los establecimientos NO TIENEN CÓDIGO QR que escanear.

> No te puedes fiar de las restricciones. De nada sirve informarse de las restricciones de tu ciudad en la aplicación si después cada concello pone las suyas propias. Consulté una restricción relativa a presenciar un evento deportivo en la app, llamé al número de atención Covid, me confirmaron que podía ir y cuando llegué al pabellón no me dejaron entrar por la normativa que puso el concello. En la aplicación no se puede poner una normativa en un concello determinado y que realmente no sea así.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:22:05__
