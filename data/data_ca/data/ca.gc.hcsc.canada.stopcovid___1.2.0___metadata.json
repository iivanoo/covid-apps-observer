Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.\r\n\r\nCOVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. \r\n\r\nSeveral times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive.

The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.\r\nOther phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.\r\n\r\nCOVID Alert has no way of knowing:\r\n\r\n-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services\r\n-your name or address\r\n-the place or time you were near someone\r\n-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed\r\n\r\nProvincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada.

        "1. Don't want to have location on all the time just for this app. My phone, along with many others, can't update to Android 11. 2. Without the app it's 14 days isolation from last contact with a positive case. With the app it's 14 days *from the date you received the notification*. See saskatchewan.ca/covid19-apps . If the website is wrong, get them to fix it. 3. Now the app is collecting a lot more data. They say it isn't tied to your IP but how can you know for sure?",
        "I randomly checked the app this morning too see if it was working. I enabled Bluetooth before opening the app but it showed a notification asking if I wanted to turn on notifications which told me to turn on Bluetooth (it was). I have no idea how long this app was not working while I was out getting groceries etc. I would have never received a notification had I been exposed... Atter today's update, it works as expected.",
        "Continuously pops up an alert \"COVID Alert\" when just checking, creates a lot of anxiety. Edit: Changed review to 1 star. Now says reporting is unavailable in my area. This means there is no way to report a diagnosis or for others to do so and the app notify me, rendering this app useless. This is in a major metropolitan area, too.",
        "I no longer have an exposure log in google after recent update. No longer exists to check if the app is checking or not. So I don't know if if the app is working or not. Before the update it checked twice a day. Now ..? I have already said this-reply sent by app developer said to check my exposure log...how when it's not there? I am on Android 11 and app updated few days ago. So now what?",
        "l have this app on my Android phone, & it works fine. I am very disapointed that the app is still not available 4 my Samsung/Android devices. I would think great effort would be put in2 making sure all mainstream devices are included, 2 help protect everyone from this hideous, life robbing desease! *In response 2 the developer: Samsung IS an Android phone, running Android 10 OS, with Google Play always up 2 date. As 1 of the biggest makers of Android devices, that leaves a lot of people out!",
        "At first I gave this a five-star review because I think it's extremely important, however, a few people I know have been in contact with somebody who tested positive and all of Ontario's test centers turned them away. What is the point of a tracing app if people who have been in contact with people who have tested positive are not allowed to be tested? This app is essentially useless now. Great job, government. Can't be any more incompetent.",
        "The app doesn't seem to be working anymore. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Tried force stop and reopened app. When I go to the exposure notification. I don't have a log. I have Android 11. My Bluetooth and location is on.",
        "This app has being a MASSIVE pain... Even with all the updates, it still randomly locks up or crashes my phone. As well as disrupting my Bluetooth headset randomly when a lot of cars drive by.",
        "I fully support the reason for this app. However, what's the point if it won't even do its job? I was standing RIGHT NEXT to someone who was positive for covid and my phone gave me absolutely NO INDICATION that I had been exposed. So what's the use of this app??????",
        "I spent 12+ hours in a major metropolitan healthcare setting, with multiple positive individuals around me. Not a single notification. Is it that the app isn't being used by people or, just as likely, is it yet another expensive, useless government project? Either way, it's clearly garbage. App deleted, since it obviously doesn't work as advertised. Edit: Dev's response proves my point. Either it's not being used or it simply does not work.",
        "I dont understand how this will ever work of it keeps turning itself off. I check everyday and have to turn the stupid thing back on.",
        "Performance metrics should be opt-in. I cannot find a setting to disable these new performance metrics, and \"one-time\" notification was missed, so I have absolutely no idea what you're collecting. Not cool.",
        "People need to report for this to work. I know tons of people who have had Covid but no one has reported it to this app. So basically useless. And I have never seen an Exposed To on my app. Still I will keep it just in case and to do my part.",
        "Questionable. I downloaded back in september. I used to get a notification every week with a report, lasted a few weeks. Then i heard you have to check your app every day so it doesnt shut off. I used to be able to check the app in google settings, told me when it last checked, and how many interactions. No more. I dont really know if this app even works. Seems it was made by someone with little knowledge. I keep it running with the hope it is working, but have little faith.",
        "The government is aware that they're having issues getting people to trust them & install the app in the first place so the response from the government is to start collecting MORE data & metrics from users of the app? Where is the logic? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Uninstalled. Small amount of trust I had, evaporated. Sorry.",
        "Zero, but gave it a 2 for effort. It would be great to see the statistics on the number of events transpired, and if this has done anything or is just another waste of money. Thinking its the latter? Who is going to log in, as exposed, then go out for a walk to a crowded area? Million downloads? Hmmm.",
        "I have been trying to get my one time code for testing positive. It is still not available five days later please help me. I have gone to the Ontario website multiple times. I guessing I am not the only one.",
        "After several emails posts online and my initial review this app has been updated to obfuscate your ability to know if it's working. They removed the ability for you to check and confirm if it actually works. Previously it's completely random . It could go weeks or days between checks. Why you removed the ability for users to see when it last checked for a covid exposure smacks of hiding the failures of this app. Why did you remove our ability to see when it last checked for an exposure?",
        "As others have mentioned the app wants my location on to operate. I can't update Android operating system to 11.0, which apparently is required for Covid alert to not need your location. I'm assuming I can't get AOS 11.0 because my phone is older. Too bad. I'd think this eliminates a lot of people. I keep location turned off and don't want to turn it on for this.",
        "This is a great idea.Unfortunately, this app drains my battery very fast. I have a newer phone and my battery usually lasts a day and a half with moderate usage. After two days of having the app, I've had to turn off my location and Bluetooth during my work hours to extend my battery to the end of my day. From 8:00am to 11:00am, my battery dropped from 100% to 80% with very little personal usage. With a newer phone, this shouldn't be happening. Before I installed the app, this was not a problem.",
        "An update was done and now I cant login. I put my email in to get a code sent to me and nothing gets sent.",
        "Great concept. But 2 things...I wish I had known about it sooner...how many people would comply if they knew it existed. More advertising needed. 2...I never use my location data. I don't believe it's safe. This app should be able to work without it when its bluetooth connected. I read other reviews that said the same, and the answer was it should work without it, u just need the newest version. Well I just downloaded today and it wants my location. I'm not comfortable with that.",
        "It's a good app, but it has a major flaw: it depends on people reporting that they have a positive covid test in order for it to work. There are many articles that reported almost no one who has tested positive actually reported on the app. This app is next to useless. Save your storage space",
        "Amazing idea with a major flaw; even if it says it doesn't track your phone it requires location services to be turned on (GPS). Most users turn off that service to extend battery life which renders the app useless. If the contact tracing is done via Bluetooth then it should work without the lication services. I'd say about half of the users are in the same boat with an offline contact tracing app. This has to be fixed.",
        "I am an avid supporter of the app concept. However I got a notification that I had been exposed to a positive case. Without any indication of when/where exposure happened, one does not have sufficient info to make an informed decision. The lack of info undermines the precautions someone takes when they are in public (ie. At the grocery store). I got a test, just as the app recommended, but I have to self isolate for 14 days regardless if I get a neg result. The app needs to be more precise.",
        "I updated my Android app back in November after the first bug and assumed that fixed the exposure check bug. When I heard about the iPhone bug, I looked at my logs, and no checks had been logged since Nov. 24. I force quit and restarted, opened in foreground, and it immediately checked 14 times, all with the same timestamp. It still will not check while running in the background, the app has to be open and in the foreground at all times, which is next to useless.",
        "In early Dec. I wasn't able to show any scanning other than when I went directly to the app and it showed only the same time for scans as the time I opened it. Updates to the OS, around the 23rd has fixed the issue and I can see that the app is working as it should be. Thank you for your response. Thought you should know that the OS update resolved the problem.",
        "Like many others, I was pretty disappointed to find out that despite what this page says, it DOES require your device GPS/location services to be on. As soon as I turned it off, this app produces a warning that \"Covid-19 alert is off\". When you turn it on, it says \"your phone needs to use Bluetooth to securely collect and share random IDs with other phones...\", but then when you click continue, it says, \"turn on the device location settings\"... \"The device location settings needs to be on for Bluetooth to detect nearby devices that have exposure notifications on....\" So, no matter what you do, this app requires both Bluetooth AND GPS. Aside from that... we're in a pandemic and there are worse things to worry about, so I still encourage people to use it as it does help save lives and stop Covid.",
        "The app had not been checking for exposures at all, so I installed the updated version. It did 14 checks at once, but says it has done 14 checks within 14 days (with the date and time stamp all the same) and has not checked since then,that was 4 days ago.... it doesnt work, but I have to charge my phone 3 times a day because of the way its sucks the battery life.",
        "UPDATE: The app has been updated and this issue resolved. Thanks! I had the earlier bug where almost 2 weeks passed and the app did no exposure checks. Over the past few days, the app will only register exposure checks after I open the app. My understanding was that this process was done automatically and in the background, but that's not the case right now.",
        "Really good app! I would just love to see if I was around anyone at all for any amount of time who reports a covid diagnosis. I work in a grocery store and am not usualy around people for more than like 5 mins so its almost ineffective for me to use to know if I've been exposed to it. I feel like 15 mins is too long to have to be around someone for this to work.",
        "As with other users, this has stopped doing exposure checks since early November. I'm in touch with support but not getting anywhere quickly. Also just checked with other members of my household and all have stopped working, all on Android. Looks to be working after Nov 20 update. This looks to be broken again after working for a few days. No checks on Dec 2,3 or 4. Kept app open on Dec 05 and got a dozen checks in about an hour .",
        "When it was announced there was a bug preventing some devices from regularly checking for exposure, I downloaded the update assuming that would fix any problems. I just checked the settings this morning (Dec 7) and the app had not checked since November 26th, and previous to that, November 20th.",
        "Does what its supposed to. I haven't noticed any slow downs on my phone nor did I noticed any extra battery usage. I think everyone should get this app. And if you are concerned about privacy, but you have other apps like Facebook or Instagram then you shouldn't be, this uses way less permission then those.",
        "Slow, unstable, doesn't track anything. It requires you to have EVERY function of your phone on, it makes my phone overheat and die within 30 minutes. On-top of that, it doesn't have any history of communication with other phones. I've been to the grocery store etc and haven't had the number change. This is beginner level coding on a basic App. How can a government flop so bad?",
        "The recent update to show a notification while checking for exposure makes me want to uninstall the application. I don't want to be reminded this app even exists on my phone. Just notify upon exposure, or at least let us configure notifications within the app. It's scary enough to see the notification you get when your Bluetooth is disconnected, I don't need that brief moment of anxiety every time your app decides to check for exposures.",
        "**UPDATE** I actually fixed it. For some reason even though Google Play protect was showing updated, Google Play Services was not. It didn't want to update in the Play store, so I went through a back door way to update it. It works now though and thank you!** Doesn't work on OnePlus 6 with the default stable OS @ Android 10 Oxygen OS 10.3.6. Google Play Services is October 2020 and security update is September 2020. It says not compatible with OS. It used to work up until a month or 2 ago.",
        "I know the app has some minor issues but no technology is perfect, so many thanks to all the hard working developers! My only suggestion is to have the date and time of exposure available to the users so contact tracing becomes easier.",
        "Can't reset the app after exposure notification. I received a notice by the app that I was exposed to someone that tested positive for Covid-19, so I went to get tested, and my result was negative. However, there is no way I can find in the app to reset it, so it is still telling me that I have been exposed. I can't tell if it is the original exposure, or a new one. This really renders the app useless going forward after an exposure warning.",
        "I appreciate this App and couldn't get it installed fast enough. I spent over 2 weeks in hospital fighting this horrible virus. I wish people would download this App and quit whining about getting the update \"scanning for exposure\" and be thankful we have this App. I wish I had this App before I got COVID. It is a horrible, deadly virus that was touch and go for me. Nine months later I am considered a \"long-hauler\" because I'm still dealing with problems from this virus. TAKE IT SERIOUS PEOPLE!"
