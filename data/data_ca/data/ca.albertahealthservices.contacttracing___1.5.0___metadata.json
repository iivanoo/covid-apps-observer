        "Atrocious. It devours battery life when it's open, which it never is, because it crashes all the time. It is full of bugs that prevent Android phones from communicating with Apple phones and vice versa. It's barely being used by the provincial government - something like 20 cases have been tracked using the app since its launch. It's full of exploitable security issues. It's absolute junk and should not be on your phone or anyone else's. It's time for the federal app to be rolled out in Alberta.",
        "I noticed two obvious faults to this app. The insane power consumption when it's running and the fact that it doesn't stay running. Not very good for tracing anything if it won't stay on in the background. No amount of settings or permissions fixes this issue. I can't figure out if the developer is still in high school and did their scouts best or if s/he just took Kenneys money and ran.",
        "Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.",
        "Cannot use as I'm not going to leave my Bluetooth running all day. Barely functions. Drained my battery in less than 2 hours. I don't trust the collection of data won't be sold to private health companies (ie. Vital Partners). Nearly $1M spent on an app that doesn't even work.",
        "So my federal taxes already paid for an app that was rolled out earlier, works better, and is more widely adapted... Now Alberta paid a million bucks for this needless app? Rolled out late with lots of issues. What's with the location tracking? I'll be watching the battery usage too. Every other Covid update from Hinshaw she talks about technical glitches so how am I to trust this App will work as advertised. I will use this app to try and do my part but it seems like such a joke.",
        "I've had this installed since it was released, encouraged friends and family to use it as well. I know several dozen people that have been diagnosed with covid-19, including myself. Not one single person I know has been asked to use the app to actually trace positive cases.",
        "Drains the battery big time, and aren't we supposed to be using the federal app? Quite useless if it's only detected 20 whole cases of covid. Also useless if my battery is dead before 11am due to how much battery this drains. Also, why is this using location data when it should only be running off of Bluetooth?",
        "Doesn't communicate with iPhones. Doesn't work in background mode. Drains battery. Doesn't work without contact tracers who aren't tracing general population. Non functional app.",
        "Despite assurances it would be private, it requires being able to use your location data at all times. The Federal app uses just Bluetooth and doesn't require tracking your location. Not a good look. Won't be using this app.",
        "Works on Android. Almost a year into Covid and it still doesn't work on Apple. Overall a poorly planned and even more poorly implemented app.",
        "Doesn't work adequately. Will not properly communicate with iPhones due to poor design. Can't be relied on for any form of decent contact tracing compared to proper tracing apps adopted by other provinces (ie Canada Covid Alert). Also useless if you mute between provinces for business.",
        "Beware... this app drains your battery if you are an iPhone user and does not seem to work properly. Also privacy issues may be of concern.",
        "Terrible app. With information coming out about the mismanagement of the app at the provincial level I would feel safer if the province finally agreed to use the national app. I downloaded and set up the National app in less then a minute.",
        "Why do we have to use this app instead of the federal one? Alberta and all of the provinces should be using one app, and the federal one is well designed. I just heard that $700k tax dollars were spent on the development of this app, and that it has only been used in 19 cases. Let's stop wasting money on this app! Our health minister should let Alberta use the federal app and help ease the task of contact tracing. I'm uninstalling this!",
        "IS ANYBODY ELSE USING THIS APP? I did find a way to run this app on my Android 8 that doesn't kill the battery and is not taking up the notification bar by displaying a huge notification area. And yes it is still running in the background.",
        "EDIT: *NO LONGER A BATTERY DRAINER* It seems something was updated. Version 1.4 Get back to work, 'Berta. (Previous Review: Battery drainer. The only way to reasonably use the app is to turn it on around others. Otherwise, not a \"set it, forget it\" solution. The overall function of the app is clearly explained, and is fine to use when needed. No crashes, flawless app persistence.)",
        "This app was well intentioned - genuine kudos for getting it out so fast! But at this point, functionally, it's a joke. Just like Alberta's covid response! Love that consistency.",
        "Buggy AF and a huge battery hog. I tried it again after the \"fix\" came out and it's as bad as ever. Google Play should drop this app.",
        "I am still getting a notice that says \"if you are getting this message please restart your phone\" I did and the message came right back. Glad we are spending thousands on this app Kenny.",
        "The sticky/unswipable notification that the app is running is annoying and intrusive, and despite repeated reviews that this be fixed, it still has not been.",
        "The fact Kenney is forcing us to keep using this despite the data being useless after two weeks is frustrating and tonedeaf. I'm not changing my review on this, and hope this incompetent colostomy bag of a premier learns a bit of humility and to accept the usage of the federal app. Uninstalled, and I'm not going to follow his lame advice either.",
        "I appreciate the effort Alberta made to get this out so quickly, but it's time to switch the Federal system which is more reliable, comprehensive, and easier on my battery. Uninstalling as there not enough people using this anyway.",
        "Drained my battery! Downloaded the app yesterday, woke up & my phone was dead. For functionality of Covid-19 tracing, don't we need an app that won't kill off our battery so we can be reached? Update: Apparently, infected Albertans aren't uploading their info on this app. News says only 19 infected people have uploaded their data. With that kind of progress, this App isn't very useful then.",
        "Kills your battery! What's the point of having a COVID-19 tracking app if it will kill your battery and your phone won't be on to track anything. Unfortunately I'll need to uninstall it.",
        "It causes serious battery consumption due to having to leave bluetooth on and has too many bugs to be a reliable form of contact tracing",
        "Seems good so far. I have been running the App for 12 Hrs, and the phone claims it's consuming 1.1% of all battery usage. I would hope most of negative reviews arn't a partisan attack, because it will deter more people from using the app, which will render it useless. Do your part folks!",
        "Terrible app compared to the scope of the federal one. Uninstalled and waiting for AB to adopt the right solution. I want to know if I am exposed to covid from out of province visitors just as much as if exposed by locals.",
        "Humiliating that our province do this. Prevents cross province tracing as effective the federal app. This also fails to even trace. Please, we know your separatist values are your priority but for the province's health just work with the rest of Canada for once. You claim the federal app doesn't work yet this feels like what a high schooler made on a calculator.",
        "This app gives me comfort that if I become infected, all of those with the app that have been around me will get notified. Nothing leaves my phone unless I get sick and then voluntarily download it. (Watch the video on the website) You are more protected and helping to protect others if you have the app.",
        "Works well my old pixel 2 xl and my current pixel 5. No noticeable battery issues or crashing. Had it up an running in less then 3min.",
        "This app is awful. Big impact on battery life. Who knows where the data is going? Also completely useless. The ucp should be using the federal government's app.",
        "99.9% identical to the federal app, but less effective because less people use it. You can and should install both apps if you want to be alerted about potential contaminated contact with any travelers who only use the federal app. Devs, pls merge databases already and make this thing useful for everyone. I swear Kenney doesn't have to know; and wouldn't understand anyway.",
        "Terrible app. Why is the province still funding this when the federal government has a more efficient, more secure, and overall better app",
        "Janky implementation, and AHS needs to CALL you to tell you that you have been exposed, which they have just stopped doing entirely. It's useless. Alberta government needs to allow us to use the national app ASAP.",
        "It works. This app works and does not crash. If you're worried about battery life, you can do more by turning down your screen brightness than by not using this app.",
        "Not compatible with the federal app, which the province has thus far neglected to provide functionality for. Please take our health and safety seriously.",
        "Easy to use. Haven't noticed any battery drain on my android phone.",
        "This app kills my battery poorly programmed, time to switch to federal, uninstall and wait until brain trusts of this province figure it out and approve the federal app.",
        "Horrible battery drain. UCP should smarten up and do things well instead of cheaply.",
        "Would give a zero, but a 1 is as low as it goes. Battery issue fixed yet? Has it been approved by the Privacy Commissioner yet? Is data going to Telus or Saudi Arabia still? Why not use the Canada wide app? Oh yeah! Politics."
