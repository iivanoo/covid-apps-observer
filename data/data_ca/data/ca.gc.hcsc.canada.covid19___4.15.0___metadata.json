        "Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.",
        "Doesn't work. Uninstalled and tried again same thing, freezes at main screen and no other options.",
        "It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.",
        "For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be \"loading\" either. It's just text. So what's up?",
        "[Original Rel review] Unreliable notifications. No app exit stratagy, that's very poor design. Otherwise fine app but becoming very slow to load or change tabs. [2020-10-21 Rel] Still no proper way to exit app. Extremely slow response throughout, even on fiber internet. [2020-10-27 Rel] Workflow error. After submitting daily check-in returning to home tab app thinks daily check-in not done. Exit and reload app check-in noted correctly. Other faults remain.",
        "Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of \"no symptoms\". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.",
        "What if the point of this app? It gives generic information on a wide basis. How can I determine if my specific area is affected. I know the province numbers may be up but that does not address our regional breakdown. I found this app to be completely useless and unnecessary. It would be more useful had it been merged with the covid alert app. Disappointed. As useless as another statue in Ottawa.",
        "Easy to use... The more people that use it, the more useful it becomes as a tracking tool!!!",
        "This is not a be all end all app. It has good information. After you submit your symptoms, you lose the bottom menu (Home, Stats, etc). You have to back out to get to this menu. Not easy to exit the app.",
        "There should only be one Health Canada covid app: covid alert I wanted to install the Canadian covid alert app, but installed this one by accident. Covid alert is a useful secure app, this thing seems pretty useless. Maybe health canada should focus on a single covid app, or better: provide covid alert functionality through the covid 19 app.",
        "Absolut joke of an app. Today is Oct 22nd and I wanted to see details under the Stats tab for a more detailed look at local cases. Latest data shown is from September 25th!?!? Really!?! Useless app...uninstalled!",
        "Nothing to rave about I expected at the minimum covid results in my area code is this the app that quebec took months to decide if they would offer it ! Wow if so I am really worried now !!!!!",
        "Easy to use and so easy to contribute to public safety. Super!",
        "Application fails to launch on Galaxy S10 models.",
        "Very useful and helpful, thanks for introducing this app through out the pandemic",
        "I think the app is very important and I use it daily to check in. However 14 day isolation for a headache?",
        "Wants me to isolate for 14 days for a headache. Needs better descriptions. Public health has different opinions of close contact. This app says No, my public health says yes.",
        "This app tells me every single day with that day's date to self-isolate for 14 days, even though I'm entering NO SYMPTOMS.",
        "I have used this before. I have location on, googles scanning service for wifi location also on. When I open it, it takes me to a white page with the BC logo and states there is an app error. I am confused because there seems to be a seperate app for BC anyway yet thats what is happening and have not got past the error message to try and correct it to Ontario",
        "Stupid app wont let me send the daily check in results",
        "Basic app. I wish they hooked it to googles contact tracing by bluetooth, that would make it 5 stars for me. And i would be much happier. Its nice to have the numbers that easy to see but i don't think it gets updated often enough",
        "Pretty basic, wish this worked with the COVID tracking that was installed on my phone by Google. Also, I set the reminder for daily at 9am and it has only reminded me maybe 2-3 times since installing, which was 10-14 days ago.",
        "A good start, decent app. Could benefit from adding contact tracing, scientific information, better stats and province-specific information... Make it truly a NATIONAL app to organize the response!",
        "Its pretty cool but i kinda wish it had it so you can see what are other peoples symptoms are in your area for people using the app.. kinda how snapchat has snap spots in your area. Other then that pretty cool.",
        "I am very happy with this App. I have been using it every day to check our country's COVID-19 status. I trust the information provided by this App over and above \"ANY\" media or news groups...",
        "This comes up if you search for Canada Covid app. But it is NOT the alert app - you must add the word Alert to your search. Dumb!!",
        "It's easy to use .",
        "Pretty dissapointed to find out it didn't include any sort of contact tracing information system, but it's a convenient way to stay informed of COVID-19 nonetheless.",
        "Well there is no DOT. to put in your temperature. Like 96.9 F do we write 97 F? Or 97.4 F we round it off to 97. This has to be fix. Something as simple as this should not be in the Beta testing phase.",
        "On the surface the app appears to do what it claims. I will update my review once I've had a chance to inspect the code for myself and do some testing of my own.",
        "Easy to use and to input daily symptoms. The purpose for the lack on contact tracing is to ensure privacy concerns on personal data.",
        "I find that it helps me think of my health. I'm also glad that this is out there for us to do. I too have COPD, Asthma which makes me cough through the night that bothers me & my neighbors. I am a smoker which I know I should quit but I don't have the umph to do so that I don't want any Dr to ask me if I want to quit. It'll just make me smile more.",
        "Useless. The app doesn't take advantage of contact tracing making this just an alternative for information and basic surveys which the government could have had on a website.",
        "Meh. Not great, maybe of some use to somebody. I had expected more functionality with integrations.",
        "Great use of plain language, and app is easy and helpful.",
        "Installed easily with no issues.. Dont see why others have issues. Canadian stats was nice to see...",
        "I have installed and currently use the app to see our stats of cases country wide etc. Loads quickly and cannot speak to alerts as thankfully I hope I have yet to receive any.",
        "The app doesn't let you know if you come in contact with someone who has C0VID19. This needs improvement. Otherwise it's a good app.",
        "Very good support and optimal information-sharing through this crisis.",
        "Governement gab Lots of stuff, but impossible to navigate decently. No clear instructions or helpfull tips/guidance"
