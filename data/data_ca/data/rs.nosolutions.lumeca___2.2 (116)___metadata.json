        "This app has been a lifesaver during this crapshow of a pandemic. I appreciate the fact that I can speak with a physician, in very timely fashion, without even having to leave work. The times that I have used Lumeca, the people I have spoken to, have been nothing short of professional, accommodating and helpful!",
        "The absolute best service when you have a child at home! Has been especially great not having to worry about going into a clinic during the pandemic. The care staff, nurses and doctors have always been very friendly and patient as well. Can't say enough good things! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
        "I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency and openness of this app. It's to the point, no headscratching and keeps you updated even if you're not on it. Very glad I used it!",
        "Very convenient for my family and I! I don't have to wait in a doctor's office with my toddler and can book a same day appointment with a doctor! The doctor's I have spoken with are very professional and caring. Highly recommend!",
        "The app is easy to use. No waiting hours to see a doctor in a crowded waiting room. It was great consulting with a doctor on time.",
        "Love this app! So convenient! Within three hours had a prescription:) would recommend this app to anyone! Definitely be using this as much as i can... this is my third time and cant complain!",
        "Had a great experience used it immediately to talk to a doctor about prescription. I downloaded the app and within 2 hours I was talking to a doctor. I highly recommend this app.",
        "Such prompt and efficient service. Will use again for sure.",
        "Was very easy to sign up and add other family members. Got a response quickly and discreetly in the privacy of my own home.",
        "Really appreciate this app and it's convenient setup, especially in these current times. \ud83d\ude4c",
        "The app is quick, easy, safe. The doctor that was assigned was very knowledgeable on my issue, and I would recommend the app over a mediclinic as it's faster and more convenient. The staff who set the appointment are very friendly and easy to talk to.",
        "Easy to use. Great friendly professionals",
        "Very quick response and follow up .",
        "This application is amazing! I was able to meet virtually with a fantastic doctor on a Sunday morning when my regular clinic was closed. Immediately after our meeting, my pharmacy recieved the fax for my prescription and I was able to pick it up later that day. I will definitely be recommending this app to others! A wonderful solution for those trying to stay home and stay safe during covid.",
        "Very helpful and caring Coordinators and very easy to use. I had a very good experience with a Doctor who did not mind explaining things to me. If needed, I will not hesitate to use this again.",
        "I really loved using the app! As someone with anxiety it was really nice not having to leave my apartment, I was definitely more relaxed then if I went to a doctors. I didn't have wait long too. My appointment was at 12:30 and the doctor came in a few minutes later. Even if they are behind atleast you are at home.",
        "I was skeptical that I was going to see a doctor, get a prescription and all for free.... ask me how great it felt to actually see a doctor, get a prescription for free and not have to wait in a room with 20 other people but actually be at home in my PJ's! I had Dr. Bucko and she was great, I will use this app again & again instead of leaving the house that's for sure!",
        "Omg. I use to dread having to go to the doctors office. Wait 2 hours (for a scheduled appointment no less) for a 2 second prescription refill. Love that I can do it from home. And it's free!",
        "Have only used once for prescriptions.. It's hard to see a doctor here... Will use it again...",
        "What a great app! I downloaded it, registered my account and spoke with a doctor all within 2 hours. Very impressed. I will definitely use this service again.",
        "Honestly just not very useful. Docrtos and their support dont communicate enough and I constantly have to follow up but the application doesn't allow you to follow up with the doctor and you have to constantly start new consultations.",
        "Very easy to use and during these covid times its great to talk to a doctor in the safety of your own home, especially for little issues.",
        "Excellent experience. It was professional, very well administered and timely. The Dr. was very friendly and warm.",
        "I got what I needed, I didn't get covid, I was already at home! Happy bday!",
        "This app just keeps closing every time I go to the consultation",
        "Fast friendly service",
        "I was very pleased. I received the information to help me make my decision",
        "This was a great App to use, I was unsure at first but they were very thorough, they advised of appointment times and the Doctor was right on time no waiting past your appointment time they followed up and gave a summary of the consoult and made sure you were taken care of. I recommend this App to anyone who does not want to go into the doctors due to the current circumstances and restrictions.",
        "I used Lumeca for the first time this morning for my daughter. It was very quick, easy and friendly. I was in contact with a nurse immediately and a Dr. within 30 mins all in the comfort of my living room! I have 3 kids and can see myself using this far more then spending the day in a waiting room for the same outcome! So happy we now have this resource!",
        "This app is excellent. I will never have to wait in a waiting room again. When the nurse took my information, she informed me it would be a 30 minute wait. Which it ended up being but this time, I was able to keep working while I waited. My doctor was very pleasant and helpful. I especially enjoyed being able to see the notes on file afterwards explaining our conversation.",
        "Very, very please with this app! Was a bit sceptical, but was put in a chat with a nurse. She assigned a doctor and I was talking with a doctor within minutes, all from the comfort of my bed at home! He discussed my lab results with me and I didn't have to wait until Monday for my clinic to open, to book an appt which most likely would have been 2 weeks out.",
        "This app is fantastic. I was at work and the doctor's office I go to for walk ins closed at 5, so I wasnt able to make it. Then I learned about this app and was seen by an actual doctor in just a few hours! I was able to continue with my day since the doctor notifies you when they are ready and available to chat. Such a neat idea!",
        "Wait times longer than i would like, but are similar to clinics. Keep in mind that you are in the comfort (and safety) of your own home. Service is very helpful, friendly, and professional. This is a great service. It does not eliminate the need for personal visits to a doctor, but provides excellent supplemental care. I believe it will also reduce the loads for in office visits and the risk of contact with contagions. Well done!!",
        "The app worked wonderfully for me. Simple to install, register as a client, and obtain medical advice and necessary medication. From registration to receiving a needed prescription, it took approximately 90 minutes. Very efficient.",
        "My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those. The nurse was nice and the doctor was nice.",
        "I love this app! It was quick and easy. And I got my prescription asap sent to my closest pharmacy and I live on reserve. This is so convenient and accessible! Thank you!!! And I didn't need to leave my house!",
        "This app is so useful! You can chat with a nurse and a doctor and avoid crowded clinics. The wait time was almost non-existent, which never happens in offices. Will absolutely use again if I need to!",
        "This app was great. The doctor got back to us as soon as possible. The nurse or consultant kept us informed of things while we were waiting. You don't have to sit on your phone. They will let you know. I definitely would recommend this app. Very easy to use.",
        "I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.",
        "This app worked great! I just needed a couple of prescriptions refilled and it took about 10 mins to answer some questions and then once the Dr was available, it was about a 10 min video appointment!"
