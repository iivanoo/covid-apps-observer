It would give a better sense of reliability if it reported to me how many other unique devices my phone came in the vicinity of and how many devices are reporting in the preceeding 24h period in my province / city. This app is worse than useless if I am the only one using it in all of Ontario. I'd rather free up space & release the processing power that this app is wasting.",

The showed exposure checks for a few days but stopped on the 28th. After I opened the app the logs showed a dozen or so checks in the last minute, but nothing since then. Is the app just not uploading IDs when it's closed or is it not sending out bluetooth beacons as well? Both situations aren't ideal but the latter is very worrying to me. EDIT: The problem I described below appears to have been fixed. I now see multiple checks per day, even without opening the app. I'm not convinced the app is checking for exposure and/or running in the background. The exposure log (settings->google->covid19->exposure checks) only shows checks after the app is opened. If I don't open the app for days or weeks and check the logs again, the most recent check lines up exactly with the last time the app was opened. I tried uninstalling-reinstalling and saw no change in behaviour. I've read that the app constantly checks for exposure as long as there is internet access but that doesn't seem to be happening on my device.",

App also assumes that we all have data plans and Bluetooth always on. Part 2: They've responded, and say we need to go online with the PHONE every day. They lack a grasp of the basic fact that not everyone has a data plan - so those who don't are being told to go to a wifi zone (maybe indoors) every day - even though in a pandemic we should be staying OUT of public places as much as possible. I really wanted to participate in this app, but when only 5% of those who have it actually use it properly, it is almost a total technology and public health failure.

In my bubble, the app works fine on Apple phones, but useless for many of the Android users. Original review: Despite Bluetooth being on 24/7, the app can go more than a week between performed exposure checks. Worked very well before the last update, but hasn't done anything for me for almost 2 weeks now.",

They suggested that it might be a connectivity issue - but my phone is not having any connectivity problems whatsoever. Obvioulsly, the most recent update has made things much worse, with 0 checks in 10 days.The idea behind this is great and I totally support it; but the implementation leaves much to be desired.
