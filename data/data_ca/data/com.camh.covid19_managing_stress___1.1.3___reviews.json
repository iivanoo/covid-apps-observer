        "content": "My only in-person experience as a patient: got a referral, then saw a doctor who promised to help and then, when I had an emergency, he passed me over to another agency that refused his referral. This app perfectly mimics the uselessness of that encounter, including having a 'discussion forum' that's only open during business hours. Everything on the app can be found with a web search. Don't waste your time downloading it.",
