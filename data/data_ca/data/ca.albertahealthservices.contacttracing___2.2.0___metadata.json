        "Unusable after the most recent update. Crashes if Bluetooth is enabled. Can't even tell if it's running, or just killing my battery with constant app crashes and restarts. I've tried everything. After it's set up with my phone number, I can never open the app again, it just sits forever on a blank screen. I'd love to do my part and help the contract tracers, but this app is not the solution it should have been. Uninstalling again. I'll try again after the next update.",
        "With this software installed, my phone will be dead by morning, every night. This has been my experience- nearly every morning this past month I have missed my alarms from my phone because even on a full charge at the time i go to sleep, it will have expired by the time i want to get up. I never was exposed to covid in the duration that I had this software installed, so i can't attest to its functionality, other than that it consumed a lot of resources on my phone such that i had to remove it.",
        "FIX THIS NOW! App just told me I needed to UPDATE BUT Only because I accidentally clicked the icon. (strike 1) It has gone from using maybe 2-3% battery in a day to that in an hour! (strike 2 & 3) My phone went from 100% to 80% in 2 hours of just sitting there and looking at the battery usage this app was nearly 6%! Compare that to the play store app and the same time frame was 1%.",
        "New update uses about 48% of my battery, prompting a premature battery drain warning. I wish AB and BC would set asside the NIH syndrome, and just enable the federal contact tracing app (which I have installed, but is usless to me unless I encounter somebody from outside AB and BC. Edit: Reinstalling the app approximately doubled the run-time, but it still uses more power than any other app on my phone: including the federal contact tracing app.",
        "Didn't tell me that it wasn't functioning because it needed to be updated until i OPENED it one day by chance. New links to stats are great but a back button would be nice.... You know, for navigation through the app.",
        "New update TERRIBLE BATTERY DRAIN. Eats more than a teenage boy. Reported via email with screenshots, got generic response. Didn't work. Will try Reinstalling. Mar 17/21: #3 Rev: If more Albertans use this it would be more effective! Still no battery problem, 5d 20hrs used 8.9%. Dec 29/20 #2 Rev: No problem with battery, 5d 19hrs used 9.2%. Minimal to assist Contact Tracing! Sept 4/20: Phone is 3 1/2. In a 12 hr period the battery usage was only 0.7%.",
        "Fantastic improvements on the battery life. Great application to track everything and one source for updates. Thank You Government of Alberta.",
        "Haven't been able to get the app to do anything. If it is operating correctly it hasn't told me I have been in contact with a Covid positive person, even though I know that I have. Waste of phone memory.",
        "Does not work I was close to 8 people confirmed a few days later with COViD 19. App did not alert me once.",
        "Huge battery drain for an app that the stubborn Alberta government insists works because they don't want to find a solution with the federal government.",
        "This app might work, it might be perfect, but it is an example if how the AB government puts its political well being before the people of Alberta's well being. The dick measuring contest this app represents makes the Health Canada app and this app less effective while undermining the purpose of running a contact tracing app.",
        "So I ended up getting COVID and asked the tracers how I can update the app so it sends out the ping to those I was in proximity to. I was told that \"most people don't use the app so we don't have anything to support you\". Is this app no longer protecting people?? I would really look forward to some reassurance form the developers..",
        "A good safeguard. But too bad underutilized",
        "Deleting. Not enough people using the app and I have to be in contact with another user for 15 minutes. Using large amounts of battery with phone sitting idle. Please adopt Canada wide app.",
        "Installed the update and now it won't open.",
        "Utterly useless app. Battery drain is a real issue. I left my phone on desk at 100% overnight and 7 hours later, it's down to 58%. Had to uninstall and reinstall 2x before being able to register. Unable to locate other users nearby after finally setting up. Will delete after this review. Need to use federal app instead of this one.",
        "%66 of battery drain from this app in one day in the background. Dont know what happened \ud83d\ude15.",
        "An error has occurred. Please try again. After entering in a valid phone number. So I restarted my phone. But this time get a error message could not reach the server please try again. Useless app.jan 10 update still useless I put in my cellphone number and click go but it won't go to next screen.",
        "I was being told my information will be kept in private. Why do they need to ask my phone numbers? The 1st version never my phone number but this one need it. The App kept eating up phone battery. My phone has a 5000mA battery. It should last 3 days if I put it on standby mode. Now, it can only last 1 day long. It toke away so much government money to design this App. Why not update this App to make it save more cell phone battery?",
        "Pretty disappointing, compared to the national app especially. Permanent notification is annoying, and seems to defeats the purpose of having a convenient tracing app if it's in your face all the time.",
        "This app only works with crowd sourcing. I can't find anyone else using the app. My work has thousands of people, many of whom are from out of province, some using the Canada Covid app. But not a single person has said they have ABtracetogether... Waste of tax payer dollars.",
        "The app (on android) started using a lot of battery capacity, so I force-stopped it and restarted my phone. Now it is fine. The only reason the app does not receive more stars is that it is not in use by enough people.",
        "Excessive battery drain.",
        "Uninstalling app because of excessive power use. 5 * the power of the next most used app.",
        "Seems to be a waste of time. Not sure why we are not part of the national tracing app?",
        "This app is garbage. It doesn't work properly, and as a result noone uses it. It would be nice if the Government of Alberta could swallow their pride and let us use the app from the Government of Canada, which DOES work - just not in Alberta. Thanks for nothing!",
        "The app keeps asking me to restart my phone. I have done so at least five times now. That notification is very annoying.",
        "Going to uninstall. It uses phone resources and the government is not doing any tracking anyway so it is just a waste. If they were serious about saving lives they would activate the Canada wide app.",
        "I don't understand how this app is supposed to stop the spread of covid?? what exactly is the app supposed to do?",
        "Burns through over 20% of my battery per day. Removed it solely because of this.",
        "Spent around four hours working in the home of someone who tested positive a few days later. Didn't get any notification from this stupid app. Useless waste of taxpayer money.",
        "Battery killer! Left for work at 80% and in a 25min drive my phone is under 50%.",
        "The permanent notification is very annoying. So frustrating Albertans can't use the national app. Get your poop in a group government of Alberta",
        "On January 29, 2021, developers advised that app can now download from US PlayStore. Previous comments related to now fixed issue.",
        "It doesn't work when I go to trace it kicks me out",
        "Atrocious memory use and abysmal battery drain. Do Not Download!",
        "Very slow to load",
        "Works fine, not noticing battery drain.",
        "Waste of time. Never has told me a thing. I hope your revision might be a little more informative",
        "Recent changes made my battery life worst. Background battery usage jumped dramatically where it would drain battery overnight while I sleep. This was not happening in past. In my opinion I think the new additions from last update are causing drain. Maybe it is constantly hitting servers to grab statistics."
