Is the app just not uploading IDs when it's closed or is it not sending out bluetooth beacons as well? Both situations aren't ideal but the latter is very worrying to me. EDIT: The problem I described below appears to have been fixed. I now see multiple checks per day, even without opening the app. I'm not convinced the app is checking for exposure and/or running in the background. The exposure log (settings->google->covid19->exposure checks) only shows checks after the app is opened. If I don't open the app for days or weeks and check the logs again, the most recent check lines up exactly with the last time the app was opened. I tried uninstalling-reinstalling and saw no change in behaviour. I've read that the app constantly checks for exposure as long as there is internet access but that doesn't seem to be happening on my device.",

But the underlying concept of privacy during a pandemic is completely misguided. Also - sick or worried people should NOT be expected to report positive results; only 5% remember to do so. App also assumes that we all have data plans and Bluetooth always on. Part 2: They've responded, and say we need to go online with the PHONE every day. They lack a grasp of the basic fact that not everyone has a data plan - so those who don't are being told to go to a wifi zone (maybe indoors) every day - even though in a pandemic we should be staying OUT of public places as much as possible. I really wanted to participate in this app, but when only 5% of those who have it actually use it properly, it is almost a total technology and public health failure. I see the lost potential of masks (a simple partial solution) and an app (a complex partial solution) being a combined failure of public health.",

Prior to this, the app was sporadically missing 1 or 2 days. I had reported this issue to the HC CovidAlert team, along with my logs, several weeks ago. They suggested that it might be a connectivity issue - but my phone is not having any connectivity problems whatsoever. Obvioulsly, the most recent update has made things much worse, with 0 checks in 10 days.The idea behind this is great and I totally support it; but the implementation leaves much to be desired. What is the point of this app, if it doesn't work?",
