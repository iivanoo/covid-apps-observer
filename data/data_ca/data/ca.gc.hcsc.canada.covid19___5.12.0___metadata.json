        "I'm trying to help with your data...I'm at 291 daily entries (including temp readings). But the app is getting so so so slow... And now the app is crashing every night after I hit submit. Takes me 3 or 4 attempts daily to add my one entry. Many times it's lost my entry entirely. I update the app regularly. I have a 12mb super phone. It is taking me 3-6 attempts daily get it to work without crashing.",
        "Very inconsistant with the daily case numbers...if Canadians are to use this for any reason they need an efficient App and not something that is mediocre...",
        "Way too slow responding to user input. It doesn't even indicate that you've tapped a button on the screen; so I can't be sure if it's processing my input or ignoring my tap! Put up with this mostly useless app long enough... uninstalling!",
        "Extremely low response time when going the daily symptoms. You can go for coffee and come back before the next screen appears. Sometimes the data is not saved.",
        "My version stopped working after the update. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still does not work.",
        "I find that it helps me think of my health. I'm also glad that this is out there for us to do. I too have COPD, Asthma. I am a smoker which I know I should quit but I don't have the umph to do so that I don't want any Dr to ask me if I want to quit. I said not at this time. On this app I'll just take my temp when I don't feel well or just a sore throat or fever. I've been getting hot but due to my bowels if I can't go.",
        "Not compatible with my device. I keep waiting for it to be compatible but it never is. The original version of the app was compatible. I got notices when I came into contact with others who had the app. I installed an update and now nothing. The app is junk if it is compatable with only a limited number of devices. Make it so! I have a Galaxy Tab A.",
        "I've been filling out the daily check-in every day since I returned to Canada from a trip overseas last March. The daily notification is a useful reminder. However, it would be more user-friendly if, when I click the reminder, it immediately brought me to the daily check-in screen rather than to the self-assessment page.",
        "Tests my patience! If I didn't think it was important to report COVID-19 symptoms, I would never use this app! It is so slow, and I mean slow that you don't know if it has sensed my touch selection or not so you tap again and again! Keeps showing that the app encountered an error when I load this app. Why did you move the Daily Check-In from being the first item on the page when it starts?!",
        "Works great. One beef is that if you ever get a recommendation it never goes away, nor does it say what date you got that recommendation.",
        "Common Google, I removed all permissions from this app, did not allow to run it in background and it is still running plus was able to install not authorized alert app. Big britch in security. App removed.",
        "Super slow, lots of lag and very delayed user input! Not sure what all this app does and is doing, but it seems that 1 minute for tapping 6 times to enter daily checkup info is excessively long and a waste of time. This review took less time than 1 daily checkup.",
        "Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.",
        "Crashes all the time when in the data checking mode. Not reliable app at all",
        "Update to previous post: I uninstalled after clearing data, rebooted phone and reinstalled. As soon as I selected my province I got the \"app encountered a error\" again. So I got rid of it.",
        "Original complaints I have remain since first release: 1) Extremely slow. 2) No proper way to exit app Android 6.0.1.",
        "Only ask for testing data weekly. Doesn't work for me and others in Alberta Canada",
        "More localized COVID-19 info would be useful. Perhaps user should configure first 3 digits of postal code and informed accordingly. In addition, could this app inform us when new releases of the #CovidAlert app are issued (since the notif app does not currently push that kind of useful info)?",
        "Doesn't work. Uninstalled and tried again same thing, freezes at main screen and no other options.",
        "Good to have app but it is quite slow to load the self check page. Please make it faster",
        "I think the app is important, however, everyday it's telling me I have to self isolate every. I haven't reported or have any symptoms, why does it tell me to self isolate?",
        "Easy to use... The more people that use it, the more useful it becomes as a tracking tool!!!",
        "All of a, sudden its crashing every time I open it. It was fine yesterday. I don't suppose an upgrade kludged it?",
        "This is not the one for contact tracing.",
        "Since last update Stats don't update at all like is use to do for every day the stats for the day don't display",
        "Doesn't update anymore. Cleared cache and data",
        "Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of \"no symptoms\". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.",
        "\"Application error\" ...not working",
        "Wants me to isolate for 14 days for a headache. Needs better descriptions. Public health has different opinions of close contact. This app says No, my public health says yes.",
        "Is there a way to edit you're symptom history? Other than that, a good app all in all.",
        "0 The app shuts down before being completed.",
        "It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.",
        "For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be \"loading\" either. It's just text. So what's up?",
        "App provides important information and has graphs that provide information at a glance. However, there is no mechanism to exit the app. No exit item on a menu, does not honour a double-tap on back. Developer needs to provide an exit mechanism. As important as the information is that is provide, it's no excuse for poor behaviour in an otherwise excellent app.",
        "Great start! Would be great to move some of the up to date info into the app so that links don't have to be followed (less resistance for using the UI), and to introduce opt-in location tracking so that if we are tested positive the government already has information on where we went and who we met (opt-in of course).",
        "What if the point of this app? It gives generic information on a wide basis. How can I determine if my specific area is affected. I know the province numbers may be up but that does not address our regional breakdown. I found this app to be completely useless and unnecessary. It would be more useful had it been merged with the covid alert app. Disappointed. As useless as another statue in Ottawa.",
        "It's clear it's not being used and over 90% of the new positive Cases don't get caught by the app so time to save the space on my phone",
        "The symptom tracker needs some improvement. I have moderate to severe asthma so I regularly have symptoms like difficulty breathing & coughing. I also have seasonal allergies so sneezing & sinus issues are common for me right now too. If I check these things off on the symptom tracker, it automatically assumes the worst even tho I don't have any other common symptoms like fever, haven't traveled, or been in close contact with know Covid cases. The app doen't ask about pre existing conditions.",
        "This app should be removed from the play store. It is what comes up when I search for Covid Alert, the official Canadian Covid alert app. I installed this, and didn't realize I was not 'protected' and wouldn't get notifications if I became a contact of someone who has tested positive. Thankfully, out of curiosity, I was checking out how many connections my phone had made with other phones and discovered I didn't have the app I thought I had.",
        "This app has helped me get a better understanding on the current status of Covid-19 in BC, but it would be nice to have it updating without coming to the store everytime. The remaining resources and information provided are also a plus and good to have at hand. Thank you!"
