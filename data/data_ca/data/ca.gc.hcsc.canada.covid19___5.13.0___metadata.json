        "Not sure why the app asks about symptoms every day, but it's good for getting the up-to-date information released by Health Canada",
        "Way too slow responding to user input. It doesn't even indicate that you've tapped a button on the screen; so I can't be sure if it's processing my input or ignoring my tap! Put up with this mostly useless app long enough... uninstalling!",
        "I'm trying to help with your data...I'm at 291 daily entries (including temp readings). But the app is getting so so so slow... And now the app is crashing every night after I hit submit. Takes me 3 or 4 attempts daily to add my one entry. Many times it's lost my entry entirely. I update the app regularly. I have a 12mb super phone. It is taking me 3-6 attempts daily get it to work without crashing.",
        "Very inconsistant with the daily case numbers...if Canadians are to use this for any reason they need an efficient App and not something that is mediocre...",
        "Extremely low response time when going the daily symptoms. You can go for coffee and come back before the next screen appears. Sometimes the data is not saved.",
        "My version stopped working after the update. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still does not work.",
        "I find that it helps me think of my health. I'm also glad that this is out there for us to do. I too have COPD, Asthma. I am a smoker which I know I should quit but I don't have the umph to do so that I don't want any Dr to ask me if I want to quit. I said not at this time. On this app I'll just take my temp when I don't feel well or just a sore throat or fever. I've been getting hot but due to my bowels if I can't go.",
        "Not compatible with my device. I keep waiting for it to be compatible but it never is. The original version of the app was compatible. I got notices when I came into contact with others who had the app. I installed an update and now nothing. The app is junk if it is compatable with only a limited number of devices. Make it so! I have a Galaxy Tab A.",
        "I've been filling out the daily check-in every day since I returned to Canada from a trip overseas last March. The daily notification is a useful reminder. However, it would be more user-friendly if, when I click the reminder, it immediately brought me to the daily check-in screen rather than to the self-assessment page.",
        "App is very slow and doesn't have most recent updates on stats.",
        "Works great. One beef is that if you ever get a recommendation it never goes away, nor does it say what date you got that recommendation.",
        "Common Google, I removed all permissions from this app, did not allow to run it in background and it is still running plus was able to install not authorized alert app. Big britch in security. App removed.",
        "Super slow, lots of lag and very delayed user input! Not sure what all this app does and is doing, but it seems that 1 minute for tapping 6 times to enter daily checkup info is excessively long and a waste of time. This review took less time than 1 daily checkup.",
        "Crashes all the time when in the data checking mode. Not reliable app at all",
        "Update to previous post: I uninstalled after clearing data, rebooted phone and reinstalled. As soon as I selected my province I got the \"app encountered a error\" again. So I got rid of it.",
        "Original complaints I have remain since first release: 1) Extremely slow. 2) No proper way to exit app Android 6.0.1.",
        "Only ask for testing data weekly. Doesn't work for me and others in Alberta Canada",
        "More localized COVID-19 info would be useful. Perhaps user should configure first 3 digits of postal code and informed accordingly. In addition, could this app inform us when new releases of the #CovidAlert app are issued (since the notif app does not currently push that kind of useful info)?",
        "Good to have app but it is quite slow to load the self check page. Please make it faster",
        "I think the app is important, however, everyday it's telling me I have to self isolate every. I haven't reported or have any symptoms, why does it tell me to self isolate?",
        "All of a, sudden its crashing every time I open it. It was fine yesterday. I don't suppose an upgrade kludged it?",
        "This is not the one for contact tracing.",
        "Since last update Stats don't update at all like is use to do for every day the stats for the day don't display",
        "Doesn't update anymore. Cleared cache and data",
        "\"Application error\" ...not working",
        "Is there a way to edit you're symptom history? Other than that, a good app all in all.",
        "0 The app shuts down before being completed.",
        "It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.",
        "For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be \"loading\" either. It's just text. So what's up?",
        "App provides important information and has graphs that provide information at a glance. However, there is no mechanism to exit the app. No exit item on a menu, does not honour a double-tap on back. Developer needs to provide an exit mechanism. As important as the information is that is provide, it's no excuse for poor behaviour in an otherwise excellent app.",
        "Great start! Would be great to move some of the up to date info into the app so that links don't have to be followed (less resistance for using the UI), and to introduce opt-in location tracking so that if we are tested positive the government already has information on where we went and who we met (opt-in of course).",
        "What if the point of this app? It gives generic information on a wide basis. How can I determine if my specific area is affected. I know the province numbers may be up but that does not address our regional breakdown. I found this app to be completely useless and unnecessary. It would be more useful had it been merged with the covid alert app. Disappointed. As useless as another statue in Ottawa.",
        "It's clear it's not being used and over 90% of the new positive Cases don't get caught by the app so time to save the space on my phone",
        "The symptom tracker needs some improvement. I have moderate to severe asthma so I regularly have symptoms like difficulty breathing & coughing. I also have seasonal allergies so sneezing & sinus issues are common for me right now too. If I check these things off on the symptom tracker, it automatically assumes the worst even tho I don't have any other common symptoms like fever, haven't traveled, or been in close contact with know Covid cases. The app doen't ask about pre existing conditions.",
        "This app should be removed from the play store. It is what comes up when I search for Covid Alert, the official Canadian Covid alert app. I installed this, and didn't realize I was not 'protected' and wouldn't get notifications if I became a contact of someone who has tested positive. Thankfully, out of curiosity, I was checking out how many connections my phone had made with other phones and discovered I didn't have the app I thought I had.",
        "This app has helped me get a better understanding on the current status of Covid-19 in BC, but it would be nice to have it updating without coming to the store everytime. The remaining resources and information provided are also a plus and good to have at hand. Thank you!",
        "Very well organized and concise information. Easy access to navigate, very well planned and executed. I would like to see \"Total recovered\" included in the \"Canada situation numbers\" to make it a complete report.",
        "Retired computer programmer here. I've reviewed the Apple-Google algorithm this app is based on and this app has excellent privacy. For those asking excellent questions about why it does not give more information about what is going on in your area, or why it does not link to your Contacts, the answer is privacy. This only know your province if you decide to manually tell it that info. Beyond that it has no idea where you've been or when you've been. Girl friends, boy friends, bars, clubs, moonlighting jobs, strange churches, political groups -- whatever -- this app does not know and cannot tell. People wanted privacy, that is privacy! Similarly with contacts. All the app knows are the random numbers of different phones it has been within 2 meters of for 15 minutes or more (I think they can adjust that). No names, no telephone numbers, no nothing that can identify people. Again, people wanted privacy and that is what we have here, privacy! Symptoms other people have in the area? Two parts to that: 1. One is that the symptoms of other people in your area might not be the symptoms you'll have. If it told you what symptoms other people in your area had this week -- the mismatch between them and you could cause you to ignore you infection until it is too late. Better that you simply be notified to call your provincial medical help number, and they can discuss with you any symptoms you have already and what to do next. 2. Privacy. The more questions the app asks, the more privacy-oriented people will complain. And you think they won't complain? People will complain about anything. If not something that concerns them, then they'll steal the 'agency' of someone else, steal their voice, and complain on their behalf. For example: a. People are complaining it won't work on phones more than 5 years old that do not have Bluetooth. It is not their phones they're worried about, it is \"other people's phones, old folks, indigenous people, poc, etc.\" b. I'm an \"old folk\". Most of my fellow oldies have new phones, purchased 1 or 2 years ago when CDMA and GSM networks stopped working. I've heard of one senior whose phone is too old. And her phone is so old she can't get a signal sitting in a coffee shop 1/8 of a mile from a cell tower. Half the towers or more just do not carry the frequency for her old G3 phone. We seniors are able to stay home much more easily. We have our CPP (and hopefully a second pension). We don't have to go out to work. A lot of us are in nursing homes. We have less need for this app than people who are out and about working with the public and socializing with strangers. Covid contact is less a problem for us than the endless loneliness. c. Indigenous people, poc, disabled -- I fit in here and again I'm unhappy about others stealing our agency and speaking for us. There complaint is based on the old dangerous stereotype of white people saying non-white people are all poor. They are not all poor. And those that cannot work due to disability or do not work due to children, are generally like us seniors, they have an easier time of sheltering at home. d. I would be more worried about the working poor who deal with the general public. Race, sex, gender, and whatever does not come into it. +++ Those who are working poor and doing jobs like sale clerk or ticket taker -- coming in contact with dozens of strangers every day -- maybe those people should be given phones by the government. But that is not an issue with this app; that is something separate for the government to do. +++ e. THIS IS THE MAIN THING: An app that would provide notifications without using Bluetooth would have to trace our movements to work. There would be no other way. It would have to invade everyone's privacy. +++ This app is not perfect in everyone's opinion. No app will ever be perfect in everyone's opinion. BUT this app delivers maximum privacy while still doing the job of notifying us of covid contacts with minimum overhead load on our computers. +++",
        "I have used this before. I have location on, googles scanning service for wifi location also on. When I open it, it takes me to a white page with the BC logo and states there is an app error. I am confused because there seems to be a seperate app for BC anyway yet thats what is happening and have not got past the error message to try and correct it to Ontario",
        "Don't think the app deserves a 4* but since it's an official app, I'll just give it that. Problem comes in when this is the only app allowed in google play. Compared to third party websites, this tracker tells you less than what a bar chart could have offered. Hire actual developers next time."
