If I don't open the app for days or weeks and check the logs again, the most recent check lines up exactly with the last time the app was opened. I tried uninstalling-reinstalling and saw no change in behaviour.

Please, something broke with the last update. This is coming from a computer scientist and software QA specialist. This is a showstopper and must be fixed now.",

I'm glad that it just uses bluetooth to tell if anyone nearby has covid rather than going the big brother route. I was also worried that a bunch of crazy's would start bombarding the app with false positives just to shut it down. Good thing you need to get an official code from health canada to report a positive test It's really fool proof! I sincerely hope everyone gets this app!",

I've now tried installing it twice and both times my phone began rebooting itself every couple hours. Super frustrating. After the first time I actually did a hard reset of my phone to try and fix issues. I waited a month after the reset to see if problems resurfaced, and they didn't until I reinstalled the app. May be some sort of coincidence, either way I'm unable to keep it installed unfortunately.",
