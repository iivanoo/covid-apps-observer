    "description": "We are very pleased to release this new version of Bugs & Drugs.  The content and delivery method have been updated. We provide you the latest content which will be dynamically updated for you in this new app. \r\n\r\nOur intention had been to follow industry standards and move to a yearly subscription model for this new release, but we have decided to delay that change and instead make this app free to everyone for the next 3 months. We hope this will be of some small help during these difficult and unprecedented times.\r\n\r\nBugs & Drugs is a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care practitioners.\r\n\r\nBugs & Drugs provides clinicians with the latest recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobials and the optimal treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It is also a key component of antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This reference can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, superinfections, resistance, and unnecessary treatment costs.\r\n \r\nBugs & Drugs is divided into six sections:\r\n \r\n1. Antibiotics\r\n2. Treatment recommendations for infections in children and adults (including selected ophthalmic, fungal, and parasitic infections), \r\n3. Recommendations for the prevention of infections,\r\n4. Treatment and prophylaxis of dental infections, \r\n5. Infections in Pregnancy and \r\n6. Microbiology\r\n \r\nThe Bugs & Drugs app is well suited for healthcare practitioners looking for an evidence-based mobile reference and provides therapeutic options in a clear, concise manner.\r\n \r\nOnce installed, you do not need internet access to use the content. Internet access is only required for initial installation of the app and to receive updates.\r\n \r\nThe content is prepared by Dr. Edith Blondel-Hill (Medical Microbiologist/Infectious Diseases Specialist, Kelowna General Hospital) and Ms. Susan Fryters (Antimicrobial Stewardship/Infectious Diseases Pharmacist, Alberta Health Services) with the help of over 40 reviewers with expertise in infectious diseases, infection prevention & control, microbiology, pharmacy, and Public Health.",
