        "content": "Greetings to anyone who reads this, If the app is only getting a 3.0 (3 Stars), is there a problem with it? Please consider the following, none of which is/are (a) conspiracy theory/theories. I can say this because countless independent studies done across the world have all found these phenomena to be true. 1. Are delusional naysayers about the Covid-19 pandemic keeping the app from scoring higher by not subscribing to it? ; or 2. Is the low rating the possible result of most of the current subscribers not getting alerts, and that others - who haven't (yet) subscribed to the app - are being lulled into a false sense of safety, even complacency? ; or, 3. Is the app a bit of a lame-duck technology - on the part of the government - and the app is not functioning properly or at all? ; or, 4. Are Albertans simply complacent about the pandemic? Go into any store which has clearly defined and labelled \"shopping lanes\" and other forms of signage, along with PA and public service announcements exhorting shoppers to abide by the store's rules and Alberta Health's guidelines, and you'll experience first-hand what I'm talking about. Indifference, obtuse behaviour, willful or blind ignorance, etc. ; or, finally (at least for now) 5. Is the media, which continues to feed us only what is \"news worthy\" to it (as it has done for nearly 3 generations), the real problem? If the app is not being kept in front of viewers or in the ears of listeners, is that the reason for the low rating? The media, along with government, controls the access to news. More often than not, it's the media doing this because \"news worthy\" really means that which attracts and is supported by the most lucrative advertising revenue streams. As CFCN says \"All the news you need to know\", which translates, \"All the news we want you to hear\". CBC, CTV, and the American networks on cable and satellite TV are all complicit in this. I'll stop now, since I've run out of time to continue. However, I must add that if the government is truly engaged in leading Albertans out of this tragedy, it will not alter, delete, expunge, rephrase, or in any other way, edit my comments because some of them have suggested government shortcomings. I'm keeping a copy of this for my own files and for posterity. Clayton Walls, Calgary June 11, 2020 @ 1300 h MDT",

I'm talking from full charge down to 10 percent in a span of 7 hours, of which 5 of those hours was spent being in battery saving mode and idle. I hope the update fixes this or retaining this app will be untenable.",
