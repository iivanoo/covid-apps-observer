        "All links are only available in google. For those that refuse to use google, the app is useless.",
        "Worked for 3 days not working now despite trying to update and reinstall Have to try something else",
        "A good and functional app",
        "Too bad the data is wrong. The app shows 407 new cases today but if you add up the cases in each region, they total to 507 new cases. You'd think that number would be double-checked before publication.",
        "Useless. Absolute trash. The app recommends contact tracing, yet doesn't provide it lol \ud83d\ude06. The app gives no localized case data, you know, the data required to make intelligent risk assessments, lol \ud83d\ude06. This app does nothing, and is the only tool available to the middle and under class. It's fun trying to survive a pandemic with no tools and no information from our government. Just delete this useless waste of time.",
        "It may not be a perfect app, but it is a good start. At least now we have a means to stay up to date with current recommendations and restrictions. There are improvements to be made, and I am sure they will be made as we continue to support it.",
        "I really appreciate how clear and easy this app is to use. Great job making a functional interface (complete with graphics!) in such a short time frame. I especially appreciate the daily updates and clarification on the self assessment tool, as well as resources regarding physical distancing, etc... Great resource for me to share with friends, family, and especially my workplace!",
        "Your app keeps opening Google Chrome for news updates. However, I don't use this browser. Can you update the app to support any browser? Android has Firefox, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, and many more - you need to support more than just Chrome. Once this is fixed, the app will get 5 stars! Edit: you guys fixed it!! Thank you! 5stars to you!",
        "The app recommended I get tested. I already know where the nearest testing centre is so I thought that was it, just show up. Nothing in the testing instructions was said about making an appointment until I drilled down to search the location for hours of operation. There in tiny tiny letters it says 'Appointment Required'. The finder app uses Chrome. Clicking on the text field pops up the keyboard and then closes it. So you can't type in your location to search. Pixel 3XL, Android 10",
        "I am spending the winter in BC. My phone is from AB. I Can't use the Canadian App because BC has one. I can't use the BC one because I have an AB phone number. I can't use the AB app in BC or the BC app in AB and AB requires a phone with Android 8 or above. My phone is a 2016 one and has Android 5 on it yet that is considered too old by the software designers - why? I dread having to get a Covid vaccine digital passport if they don't do an end user needs analysis first. They should not allow taxpayer money to be spent on a government app that can't meet the needs of at least the majority of potential users.",
        "Very well made, intuitive, and provides exactly the information needed during this time. As a bonus, the app is very respectful of privacy settings, and has location turned off by default. Highly recommend using this app to keep up to date with the current situation in BC.",
        "The assessment needs a better breakdown of symptoms. For example there are ways to distinguish between whether you are just experiencing seasonal allergies or actual Covid 19. Adding a few more questions would improve the value of the assessment and people will be less skeptical of its accuracy.",
        "The updates are now fixed and the app works well, thank you for updating, this helps track a lot of issues in the Hospice home I would also like to see a better breakdown of the daily check up a quick check up and a thorough check up option would be very sufficient but very well done app specially for proper information",
        "Haven't taken a good burn through all the materials, but I greatly appreciate the effort to coordinate all relevant, accurate info in one place, along with self-check. Even if the app has wiggle room for improvement, thank you for making it happen. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
        "When I first installed it it worked fine. Now it has terrible glitches and freezes at the end of the self-assessment section. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it and it still dosn't work. I uninstalled it again.",
        "Not good. Tells you to get checked and self isolate if you have a mild headache. For useful stats it just refers you to the website.",
        "I love the app and the up to date info it would be nice though if we could see not just how many cases there are in each Health Authority but instead the number of active cases per health authority",
        "I'd love something that started with a daily update straight from the province. Maybe a color coded system like fire warnings that is clear and actionable. What IS social distancing? Which businesses are supposed to be open? Which are deemed essential? How often should someone be at a grocery store? Make this easy.",
        "Great resource until recent update...now inaccessible on our devices. At a time when you we should be enabling access to appropriate info the app is now limited to due to browser requirements.",
        "I like it so far. I think we should see a provincial breakdown map by region. Use the self-check and government data to populate the map.",
        "Excellent app. Amazing the BC Gov can whip up something so helpful like this in such short notice! Trying to share with friends. Please review so it becomes easier to find in the app store!",
        "Does not show the right detailed information. Northern British Columbia is vast and a new case a thousand kilometres away is treated like it is on my back door. The maps could be better defined.",
        "Like it but the stats page with modeling and projections has not updated since dec 23. Everything else does in the app when you scroll around.",
        "I'm a hypochondriac, or so my therapist tells me. This app is great for me, I just had some bad gas last night and thought it might be covid-19, i researched and saw that some people get diarrhea which really worried me cause i didnt buy a ton of toilet paper. So i sat in my study until 3 am worried I was going to suffer from extreme pooping I was just glade I had my study washroom sanitized in the morning. I found this app dug right into it, went thru the self assessment and I'm ok. Thanks.",
        "Some very minimal resources and suggestions for managing symptoms. A flashy way to be told to call the nurses line, for basically any scenario. Just call 811 and save your time.",
        "Terrible app. Never gets updated and gives out of date advise. Makes you wonder what else the BC Goverment is mismanaging during the COVID crisis.",
        "Worse than useless. This self-assessment app went in circles without giving me ANY symptoms info. As 78yr old with a 5yr bowel condition waiting now for over a year in a congregate care home for a scheduled post-surgery 2nd colonoscopy behind a parachuting army of folks with possible CANCER and now Covide19, I find the several dead-end links you offer to old or sickly folks to self-assess, frankly, cruel. Their end sums up my entire site experience: \"PAGE NOT FOUND. PLEASE take it down.",
        "I think you need to add a prompt to set up the location. I'm happy to have this app. Tx",
        "Can't use it anymore. Says browser needs to be updated (not true as far as I can tell)",
        "Good info so far, but the app is not updated daily with current stats. Typical gov't I guess.",
        "It's pretty easy and basic didn't keep it for long I just keep the news on tv",
        "Would be nice if date/time of public TV updates posted on home page.",
        "Thank you for this app. Please include a graph of active cases in BC, if possible. Thanks.",
        "Why? This is nothing more than an interface to information. It's time for BC to get on board with the Canadian Covid-19 contact tracing app",
        "This app helps with understanding what to do, what is going on, and what the government is doing.",
        "Nothing really new or informative that is not available elsewhere.",
        "Stats are nice but the self assessment tells me to call 911 if I'm feeling confused.",
        "Doesnt provide the best charts to track trend/progress....new cases and deaths daily",
        "Never any updates, no clarification of who should stay off work, and an online test that only says stay at home for 10 days if you're sick. As useless as the BC government's reaction to the whole mess. People should be fired.",
        "Your app stalls at \"what did you decide to do\". FIX IT!"
