        "Super slow, lots of lag and very delayed user input! Not sure what all this app does and is doing, but it seems that 1 minute for tapping 6 times to enter daily checkup info is excessively long and a waste of time. This review took less time than 1 daily checkup.",
        "Tests my patience! If I didn't think it was important to report COVID-19 symptoms, I would never use this app! It is so slow, and I mean slow that you don't know if it has sensed my touch selection or not so you tap again and again! Keeps showing that the app encountered an error when I load this app. Why did you move the Daily Check-In from being the first item on the page when it starts?!",
        "More localized COVID-19 info would be useful. Perhaps user should configure first 3 digits of postal code and informed accordingly. In addition, could this app inform us when new releases of the #CovidAlert app are issued (since the notif app does not currently push that kind of useful info)?",
        "Original complaints I have remain since first release: 1) Extremely slow. 2) No proper way to exit app Android 6.0.1.",
        "Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of \"no symptoms\". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.",
        "All of a, sudden its crashing every time I open it. It was fine yesterday. I don't suppose an upgrade kludged it?",
        "I think the app is important, however, everyday it's telling me I have to self isolate every. I haven't reported or have any symptoms, why does it tell me to self isolate?",
        "Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.",
        "Update to previous post: I uninstalled after clearing data, rebooted phone and reinstalled. As soon as I selected my province I got the \"app encountered a error\" again. So I got rid of it.",
        "Absolut joke of an app. Today is Oct 22nd and I wanted to see details under the Stats tab for a more detailed look at local cases. Latest data shown is from September 25th!?!? Really!?! Useless app...uninstalled!",
        "Doesn't work. Uninstalled and tried again same thing, freezes at main screen and no other options.",
        "Good to have app but it is quite slow to load the self check page. Please make it faster",
        "Easy to use... The more people that use it, the more useful it becomes as a tracking tool!!!",
        "Since last update Stats don't update at all like is use to do for every day the stats for the day don't display",
        "I think the app is very important and I use it daily to check in. However 14 day isolation for a headache?",
        "\"Application error\" ...not working",
        "Very useful and helpful, thanks for introducing this app through out the pandemic",
        "0 The app shuts down before being completed.",
        "It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.",
        "For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be \"loading\" either. It's just text. So what's up?",
        "What if the point of this app? It gives generic information on a wide basis. How can I determine if my specific area is affected. I know the province numbers may be up but that does not address our regional breakdown. I found this app to be completely useless and unnecessary. It would be more useful had it been merged with the covid alert app. Disappointed. As useless as another statue in Ottawa.",
        "This is not a be all end all app. It has good information. After you submit your symptoms, you lose the bottom menu (Home, Stats, etc). You have to back out to get to this menu. Not easy to exit the app.",
        "Doesn't update anymore. Cleared cache and data",
        "There should only be one Health Canada covid app: covid alert I wanted to install the Canadian covid alert app, but installed this one by accident. Covid alert is a useful secure app, this thing seems pretty useless. Maybe health canada should focus on a single covid app, or better: provide covid alert functionality through the covid 19 app.",
        "Wants me to isolate for 14 days for a headache. Needs better descriptions. Public health has different opinions of close contact. This app says No, my public health says yes.",
        "This comes up if you search for Canada Covid app. But it is NOT the alert app - you must add the word Alert to your search. Dumb!!",
        "Keeps asking for codes that I don't have, or can't put in as it's a 1 time code.",
        "Nothing to rave about I expected at the minimum covid results in my area code is this the app that quebec took months to decide if they would offer it ! Wow if so I am really worried now !!!!!",
        "Easy to use and so easy to contribute to public safety. Super!",
        "Application fails to launch on Galaxy S10 models.",
        "App does not work!",
        "Great tech on a fantastic mission.",
        "This app tells me every single day with that day's date to self-isolate for 14 days, even though I'm entering NO SYMPTOMS.",
        "Very slow now it stops when I complete self cheek",
        "Stupid app wont let me send the daily check in results",
        "This app should be removed from the play store. It is what comes up when I search for Covid Alert, the official Canadian Covid alert app. I installed this, and didn't realize I was not 'protected' and wouldn't get notifications if I became a contact of someone who has tested positive. Thankfully, out of curiosity, I was checking out how many connections my phone had made with other phones and discovered I didn't have the app I thought I had.",
        "Retired computer programmer here. I've reviewed the Apple-Google algorithm this app is based on and this app has excellent privacy. For those asking excellent questions about why it does not give more information about what is going on in your area, or why it does not link to your Contacts, the answer is privacy. This only know your province if you decide to manually tell it that info. Beyond that it has no idea where you've been or when you've been. Girl friends, boy friends, bars, clubs, moonlighting jobs, strange churches, political groups -- whatever -- this app does not know and cannot tell. People wanted privacy, that is privacy! Similarly with contacts. All the app knows are the random numbers of different phones it has been within 2 meters of for 15 minutes or more (I think they can adjust that). No names, no telephone numbers, no nothing that can identify people. Again, people wanted privacy and that is what we have here, privacy! Symptoms other people have in the area? Two parts to that: 1. One is that the symptoms of other people in your area might not be the symptoms you'll have. If it told you what symptoms other people in your area had this week -- the mismatch between them and you could cause you to ignore you infection until it is too late. Better that you simply be notified to call your provincial medical help number, and they can discuss with you any symptoms you have already and what to do next. 2. Privacy. The more questions the app asks, the more privacy-oriented people will complain. And you think they won't complain? People will complain about anything. If not something that concerns them, then they'll steal the 'agency' of someone else, steal their voice, and complain on their behalf. For example: a. People are complaining it won't work on phones more than 5 years old that do not have Bluetooth. It is not their phones they're worried about, it is \"other people's phones, old folks, indigenous people, poc, etc.\" b. I'm an \"old folk\". Most of my fellow oldies have new phones, purchased 1 or 2 years ago when CDMA and GSM networks stopped working. I've heard of one senior whose phone is too old. And her phone is so old she can't get a signal sitting in a coffee shop 1/8 of a mile from a cell tower. Half the towers or more just do not carry the frequency for her old G3 phone. We seniors are able to stay home much more easily. We have our CPP (and hopefully a second pension). We don't have to go out to work. A lot of us are in nursing homes. We have less need for this app than people who are out and about working with the public and socializing with strangers. Covid contact is less a problem for us than the endless loneliness. c. Indigenous people, poc, disabled -- I fit in here and again I'm unhappy about others stealing our agency and speaking for us. There complaint is based on the old dangerous stereotype of white people saying non-white people are all poor. They are not all poor. And those that cannot work due to disability or do not work due to children, are generally like us seniors, they have an easier time of sheltering at home. d. I would be more worried about the working poor who deal with the general public. Race, sex, gender, and whatever does not come into it. +++ Those who are working poor and doing jobs like sale clerk or ticket taker -- coming in contact with dozens of strangers every day -- maybe those people should be given phones by the government. But that is not an issue with this app; that is something separate for the government to do. +++ e. THIS IS THE MAIN THING: An app that would provide notifications without using Bluetooth would have to trace our movements to work. There would be no other way. It would have to invade everyone's privacy. +++ This app is not perfect in everyone's opinion. No app will ever be perfect in everyone's opinion. BUT this app delivers maximum privacy while still doing the job of notifying us of covid contacts with minimum overhead load on our computers. +++",
        "We were instructed to install this to help with contact tracing. 2 months after install i was prompted to install another app called covid alert, meaning that I was using this app for nothing... the functionality should have been integrated as one app not two. It's a waste of taxpayers money to do development this way.",
        "Great to be monitored.",
        "Basic app. I wish they hooked it to googles contact tracing by bluetooth, that would make it 5 stars for me. And i would be much happier. Its nice to have the numbers that easy to see but i don't think it gets updated often enough"
