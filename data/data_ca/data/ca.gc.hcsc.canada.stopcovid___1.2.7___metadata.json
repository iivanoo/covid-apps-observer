        "It seems fantastic but it would be nice to know that it ONLY works in Ontario or around infected people from Ontario who have logged their exposure and left the province, for whatever extremely unlikely reason, before you install and finish the tutorial.",
        "No idea if it's working or not, because I can't even see when the app checked for contacts. Not reassuring at all considering the many many issues I've had with it not actually making checks before...like months at a time.",
        "It does exactly what it says on the tin (it's literally a random number generator). Only docking a star for the nags to turn Bluetooth back on, since my conventional wisdom would be to turn it on when I'm actually in public. Though I've seen a lot of reviews mention this already so that's fair.",
        "The review would be 5 stars but there is no way to clear an alert. I have had an alert on my app for 3 days, I've been tested and have a negative result. How does a person know if the alert is older or new?",
        "What is the point of this app if it doesn't do what it's designed to do?? I was sitting right next to someone who was covid positive and got no alert. Now I'm covid positive, and still no alert. What a joke. Deleting this garbage",
        "I assume it's working properly, but it would be reassuring to have a visible counter that shows how many contact codes have been exchanged. I don't care where or when, but a running count would at least let me know that I'm not the only person in town that has this installed. Edit: it will tell me how many times it's checked for exposures, but how effective will that be if none of the people I've been in contact with have this app installed?",
        "As someone working in the healthcare field, I strongly recommend this app for everyone to use. There is however an issue with the app recently where it always sends a reminder notification that \"bluetooth is off, unable to check for exposure\" multiple times a day. It ends up being very annoying since I only turn off bluetooth at home, with no one else going out.",
        "Waste of Time, This app is a good concept but you have 2 major problems that you will be unable to overcome. First you are relying on the average person to download the app(which they aren't) and second you are again relying on them to input a code(which they aren't).",
        "Good concept and I'm happy with the privacy protection protocols. A significant issue though is how frequently it reminds me to turn bluetooth on even though I'm at home. I don't want to turn notifications off because of this since it may cause me to miss a critical alert. Hopefully they manage to fix this persistent, annoying issue. UPDATE AFTER DEVS RESPONSE dropped from 3 stars to 1 star, I'm not fixing your app for you, contact Google yourself",
        "Needs A Lot of Work. The concept is fine but a lot of flaws. I tested positive for Covid and about 3 times every day it tells me to get a new code to share my new exposures. I'm in quarantine for at least 10 days and not going anywhere. I had to turn it off because it was so annoying.",
        "A few things need to change: 1) Allow opt-out of data collection 2) Make all non-exposure notification icons grey. Having a red icon pop up on a regular notification is startling. 3) Show relevant info when tapping a notification about new features. I tapped the one about data collection expecting an explanation but it just opened the app, I had to go to the gov't site and find that info myself.",
        "I randomly checked the app this morning too see if it was working. I enabled Bluetooth before opening the app but it showed a notification asking if I wanted to turn on notifications which told me to turn on Bluetooth (it was). I have no idea how long this app was not working while I was out getting groceries etc. I would have never received a notification had I been exposed... Atter today's update, it works as expected.",
        "After several emails posts online and my initial review this app has been updated to obfuscate your ability to know if it's working. They removed the ability for you to check and confirm if it actually works. Previously it's completely random . It could go weeks or days between checks. Why you removed the ability for users to see when it last checked for a covid exposure smacks of hiding the failures of this app. Why did you remove our ability to see when it last checked for an exposure?",
        "As others have mentioned the app wants my location on to operate. I can't update Android operating system to 11.0, which apparently is required for Covid alert to not need your location. I'm assuming I can't get AOS 11.0 because my phone is older. Too bad. I'd think this eliminates a lot of people. I keep location turned off and don't want to turn it on for this.",
        "1. Don't want to have location on all the time just for this app. My phone, along with many others, can't update to Android 11. 2. Without the app it's 14 days isolation from last contact with a positive case. With the app it's 14 days *from the date you received the notification*. See saskatchewan.ca/covid19-apps . If the website is wrong, get them to fix it. 3. Now the app is collecting a lot more data. They say it isn't tied to your IP but how can you know for sure?",
        "Not sure how useful this app is... This app is like the notorious pet rock - either does nothing or appears to do nothing. It would give a better sense of reliability if it reported to me how many other unique devices my phone came in the vicinity of and how many devices are reporting in the preceeding 24h period in my province / city. This app is worse than useless if I am the only one using it in all of Ontario. I'd rather free up space & release the processing power that this app is wasting.",
        "I like this app and think it is a necessary tool in our fight against Covid. However I am concerned that it hasn't been updated yet to take into account the new variants. 2 meters for 15 minutes doesn't seem safe anymore. I want to know whether I was 5 minutes within a 3 m distance of someone infected (or whatever parameters health authorities think would be precautionary taking into account the new variants).",
        "Now that the app collects more data and is less private, I will unfortunately have to uninstall it. Too bad, it was well done before. I'll remove it and maybe check into the data details again later. Just saying \"while still maintaining your privacy\" while they have access to my IP address on a central server is not good enough.",
        "The idea of the app is ok, however I think an option that detects home location or to set it to home so it's not constantly using bluetooth would be useful. No houses are close enough to each other here to detect each other's bluetooth. Personally I'm rarely around people without the pandemic and only need it to be on when out.",
        "It's a good app, but it has a major flaw: it depends on people reporting that they have a positive covid test in order for it to work. There are many articles that reported almost no one who has tested positive actually reported on the app. This app is next to useless. Save your storage space",
        "I no longer have an exposure log in google after recent update. No longer exists to check if the app is checking or not. So I don't know if if the app is working or not. Before the update it checked twice a day. Now ..? I have already said this-reply sent by app developer said to check my exposure log...how when it's not there? I am on Android 11 and app updated few days ago. So now what?",
        "Why does this app slow my phone down so much? It drains the battery twice as fast, and my phone is about half as fast. Everything lags while this app is running. I love the idea for the app, but this needs to be improved so as to discourage people from uninstalling it.",
        "I strongly support the principle behind this app and all measures to protect the users' privacy however it would be a HUGE asset to be alerted with a date of exposure, if not a date and time. It would help users identify how long to wait to get tested (asymptomatic individuals should isolate but wait 3-5 days to get swabbed to minimize false negatives) as well as to help with contact tracing. It would also possibly help users identify which activities they are doing are higher risk",
        "I've been using this app since it was released. I have to be on wifi or my data for it to do its job. I commute on public transit 45 mins-hour a day. Sometimes I don't pull out my phone to turn on my data and I don't want to run out of data before my bill cycle resets. I look after the elderly.",
        "Wakes up my phone every hour and shows a heart attack inducing notification saying it's checking for exposures. Can't disable that without disabling all notifications. Makes no sense. This app makes you live in constant fear. Good idea but poor usability.",
        "l have this app on my Android phone, & it works fine. I am very disapointed that the app is still not available 4 my Samsung/Android devices. I would think great effort would be put in2 making sure all mainstream devices are included, 2 help protect everyone from this hideous, life robbing desease! *In response 2 the developer: Samsung IS an Android phone, running Android 10 OS, with Google Play always up 2 date. As 1 of the biggest makers of Android devices, that leaves a lot of people out!",
        "At first I gave this a five-star review because I think it's extremely important, however, a few people I know have been in contact with somebody who tested positive and all of Ontario's test centers turned them away. What is the point of a tracing app if people who have been in contact with people who have tested positive are not allowed to be tested? This app is essentially useless now. Great job, government. Can't be any more incompetent.",
        "Doesn't even work!!! I've been in contact. And got covid. The person even put in the app code!!! It still shows I haven't been exposed. Realllllyyyyy?!?!? I'M COVID POSTIVE LOL I also know they did it because I made them get the app and enter their code....",
        "Update - Thanks for the prompt reply. Hope this helps others stay notified and safe. / Original Post - I do not believe this app is working correctly. It was automaticlly set as a sleeping app on my Samsung phone. Sleeping apps won't run in the backgroud. This does not make sense.",
        "I had this app installed from the very very beginning of pandemic. Conclusion: it never did anything for me besides taking space in my phone. It's completely useless mostly because people have to register they had covid-19 and sometimes they don't. Also, not everyone has data. I forget to turn on Bluetooth half of the time and the times I will turn it on are so unlikely (like being with 20 ppl outdoor? Yea rightt) I just don't see the point of it. Where is the vaccine????",
        "I have been completely unable to turn on any exposure notifications. I have gone through every option in the help menu and nothing works. I tap \"enable\" and nothing happens. Why? There's no clear explanation as to why... I have a Chinese-made phone and that's the only thing I can think would prevent it from working.",
        "The app doesn't seem to be working anymore. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Tried force stop and reopened app. When I go to the exposure notification. I don't have a log. I have Android 11. My Bluetooth and location is on.",
        "I wish the app was not optional. The bleeding whiners gleefully provide a lot more (would could be called personal) information already with FB , microsloth, google, and many others, without them being able to provide any personal safety and good health. I wish it was compulsory the same as the amber alert. And have the testing labs require/use it so they can instantly notify anyone. Instead of using resources to try and pry information out of people.",
        "Continuously pops up an alert \"COVID Alert\" when just checking, creates a lot of anxiety. Edit: Changed review to 1 star. Now says reporting is unavailable in my area. This means there is no way to report a diagnosis or for others to do so and the app notify me, rendering this app useless. This is in a major metropolitan area, too.",
        "This app has being a MASSIVE pain... Even with all the updates, it still randomly locks up or crashes my phone. As well as disrupting my Bluetooth headset randomly when a lot of cars drive by.",
        "I believe it's a useful app however it's not working on my Huawei P20 phone. The app is up to date on Google Play as well as my phone, so I am really bothered and confused at the same time.",
        "Would be a lot more effective if it did not require location services to be on. I usually keep location services off to save battery, and forget to turn it on (for this app) when I leave the house.",
        "I spent 12+ hours in a major metropolitan healthcare setting, with multiple positive individuals around me. Not a single notification. Is it that the app isn't being used by people or, just as likely, is it yet another expensive, useless government project? Either way, it's clearly garbage. App deleted, since it obviously doesn't work as advertised. Edit: Dev's response proves my point. Either it's not being used or it simply does not work.",
        "Turning bluetooth off and back on disables the app, at least on my device. I need to open the app and reactivate it manually everytime bluetooth has been disabled momentarily. Edit : Issue was fixed in December update. App works great now.",
        "If I turn on my Bluetooth but keep my GPS off the app notified me that it is inactive until GPS is turned back on. If this app isn't using GPS then why does it demand that I leave it on even though Bluetooth is enabled? Seems sus"
