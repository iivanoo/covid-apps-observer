## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

I can't use the AB app in BC or the BC app in AB and AB requires a phone with Android 8 or above. My phone is a 2016 one and has Android 5 on it yet that is considered too old by the software designers - why? I dread having to get a Covid vaccine digital passport if they don't do an end user needs analysis first. They should not allow taxpayer money to be spent on a government app that can't meet the needs of at least the majority of potential users.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 21:09:08__

### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. The app does not capture or use information about your location. In addition, location data is not collected by Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services and is never sent from your phone to another organization for any purpose. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Additionally, ABTraceTogether uses the smartphone MAC address solely for the one-time generation of a device ID to allow required communication between ABTraceTogether and the server. The MAC address is not transmitted, shared, stored, or used for any kind of personal data or user tracking.
<br>Copyright 2021 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I have uninstalled it to voice my option and hopefully my Alberta government will see the drop-off installment of this app to take appropriate action.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 16:52:14__

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 06:33:13__

> I'm tired of being asked if I'm ok. Why am I asked multiple times a day? Is it because I'm around or could have contact exposure? Asking me multiple times a day is causing me anxiety.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:17:15__

> This app should be linked with the Canada wide Covid app.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 16:29:03__

> Battery usage went from less than 5% to 35% with the new update. Unacceptable, had to delete app.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 05:11:38__

> With this software installed, my phone will be dead by morning, every night. This has been my experience- nearly every morning this past month I have missed my alarms from my phone because even on a full charge at the time i go to sleep, it will have expired by the time i want to get up. I never was exposed to covid in the duration that I had this software installed, so i can't attest to its functionality, other than that it consumed a lot of resources on my phone such that i had to remove it.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 18:20:46__

> New update uses about 48% of my battery, prompting a premature battery drain warning. I wish AB and BC would set asside the NIH syndrome, and just enable the federal contact tracing app (which I have installed, but is usless to me unless I encounter somebody from outside AB and BC. Edit: Reinstalling the app approximately doubled the run-time, but it still uses more power than any other app on my phone: including the federal contact tracing app.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 09:05:43__

> Recent changes made my battery life worst. Background battery usage jumped dramatically where it would drain battery overnight while I sleep. This was not happening in past. In my opinion I think the new additions from last update are causing drain. Maybe it is constantly hitting servers to grab statistics.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:34:09__

> The AB Government should have been in with the federal Covid App<br> :date: __2021-01-21 22:49:14__

> Idea is great, but for many weeks I used this app whenever I went out, and nothing was happening. Wasn't sure what was going on, maybe I was just safe. Then I found out, that in fact, there was actually nothing going on, this app wasn't working, and did nothing for a long time after its release. For an app that some people trust with their lives, literally, it sure sucks.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 15:22:50__

> The app keeps asking me to restart my phone. I have done so at least five times now. That notification is very annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 21:48:46__

> Ok not great<br> :date: __2020-11-19 22:23:04__

> As others have said, it's like the federal government app but worse. They should just make both available to Albertans and let us decide. My choice would be easy.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 23:44:19__

> This app requires more updating than any other app I've ever downloaded, and when it requires an update it stops everything on my phone. Not worth it. Figure out what your doing with the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 12:16:35__

> Kept it on only because it was self sufficient. It's a useless piece of garbage. Given that the Alberta government was never really interested in actually tracing, I'm not surprised. Garbage app from a garbage government.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 06:34:02__

> Constantly turning off which defeats the point of the app<br> :date: __2021-05-09 18:02:58__

> Hey why not use what the rest of Canada is using?! Tell your MP their stubbornness is killing Albertans! This waste of taxpayer $$ can't be salvaged but they should still authorize the federal app! Meantime you can download that one anyways - it works if you sign in as a different province like SK.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 23:48:28__

> FIX THIS NOW! App just told me I needed to UPDATE BUT Only because I accidentally clicked the icon. (strike 1) It has gone from using maybe 2-3% battery in a day to that in an hour! (strike 2 & 3) My phone went from 100% to 80% in 2 hours of just sitting there and looking at the battery usage this app was nearly 6%! Compare that to the play store app and the same time frame was 1%.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 17:51:26__

> Unusable after the most recent update. Crashes if Bluetooth is enabled. Can't even tell if it's running, or just killing my battery with constant app crashes and restarts. I've tried everything. After it's set up with my phone number, I can never open the app again, it just sits forever on a blank screen. I'd love to do my part and help the contract tracers, but this app is not the solution it should have been. Uninstalling again. I'll try again after the next update.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 23:48:31__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Together, let’s slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.
<br>COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. 
<br>Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. You’ll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you’ll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.
<br>Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.
<br>COVID Alert has no way of knowing:
<br>-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services
<br>-your name or address
<br>-the place or time you were near someone
<br>-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed
<br>Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app.
<br>It’s still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, you’ll find out if you were near them.
<br>COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The Application itself is fine, it works in the background and does what it needs to do without you ever knowing that it was on. The downside to this whole thing is that the roll out and the execution of making this app an essential part of daily life for people during the pandemic was a flop so you don't really need it.

> Seems like a great idea, if only it worked for people from provinces that have not yet agreed to support it. It doesn't make sense that because my Provincial Government thinks it's not a good idea, that I can't use it anyways, and possibly be warned if others like myself have the app running and get sick.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 06:10:19__

Only docking a star for the nags to turn Bluetooth back on, since my conventional wisdom would be to turn it on when I'm actually in public. Though I've seen a lot of reviews mention this already so that's fair.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 07:43:21__

> I assume it's working properly, but it would be reassuring to have a visible counter that shows how many contact codes have been exchanged. I don't care where or when, but a running count would at least let me know that I'm not the only person in town that has this installed. Edit: it will tell me how many times it's checked for exposures, but how effective will that be if none of the people I've been in contact with have this app installed?<br> :date: __2021-03-23 21:18:14__

> It seems fantastic but it would be nice to know that it ONLY works in Ontario or around infected people from Ontario who have logged their exposure and left the province, for whatever extremely unlikely reason, before you install and finish the tutorial.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 22:06:41__

> Waste of Time, This app is a good concept but you have 2 major problems that you will be unable to overcome. First you are relying on the average person to download the app(which they aren't) and second you are again relying on them to input a code(which they aren't).<br> :date: __2021-03-29 17:13:31__

> As someone working in the healthcare field, I strongly recommend this app for everyone to use. There is however an issue with the app recently where it always sends a reminder notification that "bluetooth is off, unable to check for exposure" multiple times a day. It ends up being very annoying since I only turn off bluetooth at home, with no one else going out.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 18:17:29__

> Why does this app slow my phone down so much? It drains the battery twice as fast, and my phone is about half as fast. Everything lags while this app is running. I love the idea for the app, but this needs to be improved so as to discourage people from uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 01:25:15__

> I think we should be treating covid-19 as if it were a serial killer. I don't want to be told that I've been shot after the fact. If someone receives a positive diagnosis along with the one-time key it should be mandatory to put that key into the app. If that person does not stay at home and I am near them in public places I should receive an immediate buzz on my phone so that I can increase my distance from that person. The Play store screen shows only 1 million plus downloads.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 00:17:41__

> Wakes up my phone every hour and shows a heart attack inducing notification saying it's checking for exposures. Can't disable that without disabling all notifications. Makes no sense. This app makes you live in constant fear. Good idea but poor usability.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 19:52:05__

> Often didn't update or work even when Bluetooth was on<br> :date: __2021-03-26 06:09:51__

> It says that a one time key is not available for my area? But I live in one of the most populated places in BC?<br> :date: __2021-03-23 22:58:23__

> Great idea but poor execution. It's not useful if persons with Covid are not given the codes to report it.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 12:17:13__

> Needs A Lot of Work. The concept is fine but a lot of flaws. I tested positive for Covid and about 3 times every day it tells me to get a new code to share my new exposures. I'm in quarantine for at least 10 days and not going anywhere. I had to turn it off because it was so annoying.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:47:09__

> Just hope no one forgets their phone!<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:38:26__

> I have had this App on my phone since 08/20. Do to the nature of my job I frequent Toronto and Ottawa, both hot spots. Here we are in March, 6 months of using this app, yet not one single notification. I highly doubt it's effectiveness.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 16:19:06__

> Great idea, but only 5 people in Canada are using it. Canada doesn't know how to reach out to its masses and connect with them on a personal level<br> :date: __2021-02-23 01:23:19__

> Not sure how useful this app is... This app is like the notorious pet rock - either does nothing or appears to do nothing. It would give a better sense of reliability if it reported to me how many other unique devices my phone came in the vicinity of and how many devices are reporting in the preceeding 24h period in my province / city. This app is worse than useless if I am the only one using it in all of Ontario. I'd rather free up space & release the processing power that this app is wasting.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 18:06:07__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Medic Mobile, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://medicmobile.org](http://medicmobile.org) |
| **Email** | support@medicmobile.org |
| **Physical address**  | [3254 19th Street, Floor Two San Francisco, CA 94110 USA](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3254%2019th%20Street,%20Floor%20Two%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094110%20USA) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> We are very pleased to release this new version of Bugs & Drugs.  The content and delivery method have been updated. We provide you the latest content which will be dynamically updated for you in this new app. 
<br>Our intention had been to follow industry standards and move to a yearly subscription model for this new release, but we have decided to delay that change and instead make this app free to everyone for the next 3 months. We hope this will be of some small help during these difficult and unprecedented times.
<br>Bugs & Drugs is a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care practitioners.
<br>Bugs & Drugs provides clinicians with the latest recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobials and the optimal treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It is also a key component of antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This reference can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, superinfections, resistance, and unnecessary treatment costs.
<br> 
<br>Bugs & Drugs is divided into six sections:
<br> 
<br>1. Antibiotics
<br>2. Treatment recommendations for infections in children and adults (including selected ophthalmic, fungal, and parasitic infections), 
<br>3. Recommendations for the prevention of infections,
<br>4. Treatment and prophylaxis of dental infections, 
<br>5. Infections in Pregnancy and 
<br>6. Microbiology
<br> 
<br>The Bugs & Drugs app is well suited for healthcare practitioners looking for an evidence-based mobile reference and provides therapeutic options in a clear, concise manner.
<br> 
<br>Once installed, you do not need internet access to use the content. Internet access is only required for initial installation of the app and to receive updates.
<br> 
<br>The content is prepared by Dr. Edith Blondel-Hill (Medical Microbiologist/Infectious Diseases Specialist, Kelowna General Hospital) and Ms. Susan Fryters (Antimicrobial Stewardship/Infectious Diseases Pharmacist, Alberta Health Services) with the help of over 40 reviewers with expertise in infectious diseases, infection prevention & control, microbiology, pharmacy, and Public Health.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Alberta Health Services |
| **Website**  | [http://bugsanddrugs.ca](http://bugsanddrugs.ca) |
| **Email** | bugsanddrugs@albertahealthservices.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [10101 Southport Rd SW Calgary Alberta T3A 5H4](https://www.google.com/maps/search/10101%20Southport%20Rd%20SW%20Calgary%20Alberta%20T3A%205H4) (Google Maps) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those.

> I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 17:04:30__

## Android support

| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My only in-person experience as a patient: got a referral, then saw a doctor who promised to help and then, when I had an emergency, he passed me over to another agency that refused his referral. This app perfectly mimics the uselessness of that encounter, including having a 'discussion forum' that's only open during business hours. Everything on the app can be found with a web search. Don't waste your time downloading it.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 13:48:58__

> The app contains reading material only and is not interactive in any way. Once you read the material, the app is useless. This would be better positioned on a website.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 15:36:29__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Hospital Sant Joan de Déu Barcelona |
| **Website**  | [https://www.sjdhospitalbarcelona.org/](https://www.sjdhospitalbarcelona.org/) |
| **Email** | apps@sjdhospitalbarcelona.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
