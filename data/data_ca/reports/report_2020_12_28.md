## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

> The app recommended I get tested. I already know where the nearest testing centre is so I thought that was it, just show up. Nothing in the testing instructions was said about making an appointment until I drilled down to search the location for hours of operation. There in tiny tiny letters it says 'Appointment Required'. The finder app uses Chrome. Clicking on the text field pops up the keyboard and then closes it. So you can't type in your location to search. Pixel 3XL, Android 10<br> :date: __2020-06-14 02:55:44__

> Useless. Absolute trash. The app recommends contact tracing, yet doesn't provide it lol 😆. The app gives no localized case data, you know, the data required to make intelligent risk assessments, lol 😆. This app does nothing, and is the only tool available to the middle and under class.

### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. The app does not capture or use information about your location. In addition, location data is not collected by Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services and is never sent from your phone to another organization for any purpose. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

So hopefully it fixes this battery issue. (03-Jun-20). UPDATE: After the update the app no longer drained my battery.

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent).

> Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:10:55__

> Mine won't work away from computer<br> :date: __2020-11-10 17:19:45__

> Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of "no symptoms". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 17:55:23__

> Stupid app wont let me send the daily check in results<br> :date: __2020-10-08 08:32:50__

> This is not a be all end all app. It has good information. After you submit your symptoms, you lose the bottom menu (Home, Stats, etc). You have to back out to get to this menu. Not easy to exit the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:44:01__

> For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be "loading" either. It's just text. So what's up?<br> :date: __2020-10-05 20:06:20__

> It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 14:38:34__

> This app tells me every single day with that day's date to self-isolate for 14 days, even though I'm entering NO SYMPTOMS.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:18:16__

> Meh. Not great, maybe of some use to somebody. I had expected more functionality with integrations.<br> :date: __2020-08-01 04:55:14__

> Pretty dissapointed to find out it didn't include any sort of contact tracing information system, but it's a convenient way to stay informed of COVID-19 nonetheless.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:11:40__

> [Original Rel review] Unreliable notifications. No app exit stratagy, that's very poor design. Otherwise fine app but becoming very slow to load or change tabs. [2020-10-21 Rel] Still no proper way to exit app. Extremely slow response throughout, even on fiber internet. [2020-10-27 Rel] Workflow error. After submitting daily check-in returning to home tab app thinks daily check-in not done. Exit and reload app check-in noted correctly. Other faults remain.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 15:11:04__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-08-11 04:03:41__

> Pretty useless for the user The app is nothing but a questionnaire that might help Health Canada from volunteer self evaluators, but shows no live data of infection risk around me like the Arogya Setu App from India. Privacy superceded public health.<br> :date: __2020-08-06 05:42:16__

> Why does it need access to photos?<br> :date: __2020-08-01 11:55:35__

> Relies on self report instead of anonymized health unit data - very limited usefulness.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 20:33:48__

> A good start, decent app. Could benefit from adding contact tracing, scientific information, better stats and province-specific information... Make it truly a NATIONAL app to organize the response!<br> :date: __2020-07-30 02:06:55__

> Very disappointed. No Bluetooth integration. Kind of a fail, not completely but close.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 18:07:44__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |

| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Together, let’s slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.
<br>COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. 
<br>Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. You’ll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you’ll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.
<br>Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.
<br>COVID Alert has no way of knowing:
<br>-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services
<br>-your name or address
<br>-the place or time you were near someone
<br>-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed
<br>Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app.
<br>It’s still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, you’ll find out if you were near them.
<br>COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.

> Just what we need!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 10:42:12__

> I appreciate this App and couldn't get it installed fast enough. I spent over 2 weeks in hospital fighting this horrible virus. I wish people would download this App and quit whining about getting the update "scanning for exposure" and be thankful we have this App. I wish I had this App before I got COVID. It is a horrible, deadly virus that was touch and go for me. Nine months later I am considered a "long-hauler" because I'm still dealing with problems from this virus. TAKE IT SERIOUS PEOPLE!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 05:42:41__

> So far so good.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 02:46:39__

> Half of my family now hates me.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 00:25:59__

> UPDATE: The app has been updated and this issue resolved. Thanks! I had the earlier bug where almost 2 weeks passed and the app did no exposure checks. Over the past few days, the app will only register exposure checks after I open the app. My understanding was that this process was done automatically and in the background, but that's not the case right now.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 22:27:37__

> This covid app on my Android definitely gives me so much information and updates even up to today God bless me for that I haven't contracted covid-19 I recommend you to download this app<br> :date: __2020-12-26 08:44:46__

> Everyone should install this app, it will save lives<br> :date: __2020-12-25 05:41:26__

> Edited: Updated review after Developer feedback. Fantastic app. Does exactly what it needs to. Install it. Keep Bluetooth on. Help prevent the spread.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 22:57:58__

> So Nice of them to have come up with such a Brilliant app..Ill take anything they offer knowing their Helping all of us. Thank you Kindly for this. And People its Free to Boot.😷🙏👍👍👌💪☝☝🙏😷😷.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 18:38:29__

> Change the app function so that if we're in contact with someone who has covid-19 for even 1 second that we're alerted. 15 minutes seems too long<br> :date: __2020-12-24 16:32:14__

> Feel it gives me a good comfort level. Am 81 and appreciate any help to stay safe. Blessings.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 22:09:05__

> Finally app is doing constant exposure checks<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:15:28__

> It could be very nice, but I am not sure that people testing covid positive really enter a code in the app unfortunately... I never got any alert... I understand how it works but I doubt that there's a lot of people honest enough to enter their code in it for real. That's what I meant.. ;) Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-12-22 04:05:38__

> I like the idea of this, I hope this helps people be made more aware and can be safe in exposure from others. I shut mine off till I got outside, as I'm not around anyone when I'm at home. Am I supposed to keep this on, or just when I go out??<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:52:01__

> Operates in the background, nothing to do, I see checks have happened but no exposures and no personally identifiable details. The more people download this the better.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 03:29:39__

> I know the app has some minor issues but no technology is perfect, so many thanks to all the hard working developers! My only suggestion is to have the date and time of exposure available to the users so contact tracing becomes easier.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 01:58:11__

> Wouldn't install using Google Play on LG 4. I was able to install it from iPad for the LG 4 and it appears to be working so far.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 01:51:19__

> Does what it says on the tin! Devs listened and fixed the problem thank you! Seems to work, however reports check when fully opened only according to the timestamps.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 05:28:40__

> \*\*UPDATE\*\* I actually fixed it. For some reason even though Google Play protect was showing updated, Google Play Services was not. It didn't want to update in the Play store, so I went through a back door way to update it. It works now though and thank you!\*\* Doesn't work on OnePlus 6 with the default stable OS @ Android 10 Oxygen OS 10.3.6. Google Play Services is October 2020 and security update is September 2020. It says not compatible with OS. It used to work up until a month or 2 ago.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 19:09:24__

> I loaded this app as soon as it was available. I recently learned that there was an issue with some users not getting alert info regularly n times per day. The app does not have a way of showing you this activity. Now I have found if you go to your phone Settings and search "Covid", two items will appear. If you tap on Covid-19 Exposure Notification, a list of the recent activity is displayed. The Covid Alert app MUST have a menu option to display this directly. Knowledge is power.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 16:43:36__

> Dies this App work?<br> :date: __2020-12-22 00:05:02__

> Not sure why checks stop all of a sudden: nothing nov 11 to nov 20, updated app, then stops dec 9 to dec 13.

> I am an avid supporter of the app concept. However I got a notification that I had been exposed to a positive case. Without any indication of when/where exposure happened, one does not have sufficient info to make an informed decision. The lack of info undermines the precautions someone takes when they are in public (ie. At the grocery store). I got a test, just as the app recommended, but I have to self isolate for 14 days regardless if I get a neg result. The app needs to be more precise.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:36:14__

> Used too much of my battery to be helpful especially since I rarely go out anyhow. It somehow used even more battery if I turned off Bluetooth. The choice to only notify you if you were around an infected person for a full 15 minutes also severely lowers its value.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 10:41:28__

> I like the app...but it keeps shutting my bluetooth off. Not sure why but it's annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 22:56:20__

> Can't reset the app after exposure notification. I received a notice by the app that I was exposed to someone that tested positive for Covid-19, so I went to get tested, and my result was negative. However, there is no way I can find in the app to reset it, so it is still telling me that I have been exposed. I can't tell if it is the original exposure, or a new one. This really renders the app useless going forward after an exposure warning.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 17:09:45__

> Great idea, bad execution. Most people don't know about it still. Stores and places of employment should post awareness of this. Also, as others says, it does not seem to check. I got 19 checks in past 14 days and they were all time stamped today.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 15:33:06__

> If I get near a person who has been tested positive, my phone should give me immediate, discreet notification to allow me to move away from people near me. These two factors will be a proactive approach to preventing the spread of covid-19 instead of reporting after the fact. I think the developers of this app have done a very good job of protecting people's privacy. I don't think people's privacy ought to trump people's health and potentially their lives. Only one million downloads!?<br> :date: __2020-12-11 19:10:26__

> When it was announced there was a bug preventing some devices from regularly checking for exposure, I downloaded the update assuming that would fix any problems. I just checked the settings this morning (Dec 7) and the app had not checked since November 26th, and previous to that, November 20th.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 12:29:27__

> Just wondering if this tool is actually effective due to recent outbreaks across the country. If nobody reports infection with this tool, then there will be no notification to the other by this tool. If this is true, then this is as good as a DUD. Maybe this tool should show some statistic data to bring up user confidence level⁉<br> :date: __2020-12-06 01:29:09__

> My daughter has had four notifications. She works from home, has groceries delivered and only goes out to walk her dog. No one she knows of has had a positive test. After two tests of herself and her family she no longer reacts to notifications. This sounds like another problem with th app.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 02:24:00__

> Turning bluetooth off and back on disables the app, at least on my device. I need to open the app and reactivate it manually everytime bluetooth has been disabled momentarily.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 19:24:33__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Medic Mobile, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://medicmobile.org](http://medicmobile.org) |
| **Email** | support@medicmobile.org |
| **Physical address**  | [3254 19th Street, Floor Two San Francisco, CA 94110 USA](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3254%2019th%20Street,%20Floor%20Two%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094110%20USA) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> We are very pleased to release this new version of Bugs & Drugs.  The content and delivery method have been updated. We provide you the latest content which will be dynamically updated for you in this new app. 
<br>Our intention had been to follow industry standards and move to a yearly subscription model for this new release, but we have decided to delay that change and instead make this app free to everyone for the next 3 months. We hope this will be of some small help during these difficult and unprecedented times.
<br>Bugs & Drugs is a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care practitioners.
<br>Bugs & Drugs provides clinicians with the latest recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobials and the optimal treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It is also a key component of antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This reference can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, superinfections, resistance, and unnecessary treatment costs.
<br> 
<br>Bugs & Drugs is divided into six sections:
<br> 
<br>1. Antibiotics
<br>2. Treatment recommendations for infections in children and adults (including selected ophthalmic, fungal, and parasitic infections), 
<br>3. Recommendations for the prevention of infections,
<br>4. Treatment and prophylaxis of dental infections, 
<br>5. Infections in Pregnancy and 
<br>6. Microbiology
<br> 
<br>The Bugs & Drugs app is well suited for healthcare practitioners looking for an evidence-based mobile reference and provides therapeutic options in a clear, concise manner.
<br> 
<br>Once installed, you do not need internet access to use the content. Internet access is only required for initial installation of the app and to receive updates.
<br> 
<br>The content is prepared by Dr. Edith Blondel-Hill (Medical Microbiologist/Infectious Diseases Specialist, Kelowna General Hospital) and Ms. Susan Fryters (Antimicrobial Stewardship/Infectious Diseases Pharmacist, Alberta Health Services) with the help of over 40 reviewers with expertise in infectious diseases, infection prevention & control, microbiology, pharmacy, and Public Health.

> I was skeptical that I was going to see a doctor, get a prescription and all for free.... ask me how great it felt to actually see a doctor, get a prescription for free and not have to wait in a room with 20 other people but actually be at home in my PJ's!

> My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those.

> I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 17:04:30__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Hospital Sant Joan de Déu Barcelona |
| **Website**  | [https://www.sjdhospitalbarcelona.org/](https://www.sjdhospitalbarcelona.org/) |
| **Email** | apps@sjdhospitalbarcelona.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
