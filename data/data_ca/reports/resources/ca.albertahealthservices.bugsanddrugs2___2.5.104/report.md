### Description
> We are very pleased to release this new version of Bugs & Drugs.  The content and delivery method have been updated. We provide you the latest content which will be dynamically updated for you in this new app. 
<br>Our intention had been to follow industry standards and move to a yearly subscription model for this new release, but we have decided to delay that change and instead make this app free to everyone for the next 3 months. We hope this will be of some small help during these difficult and unprecedented times.
<br>Bugs & Drugs is a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care practitioners.
<br>Bugs & Drugs provides clinicians with the latest recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobials and the optimal treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It is also a key component of antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This reference can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, superinfections, resistance, and unnecessary treatment costs.
<br> 
<br>Bugs & Drugs is divided into six sections:
<br> 
<br>1. Antibiotics
<br>2. Treatment recommendations for infections in children and adults (including selected ophthalmic, fungal, and parasitic infections), 
<br>3. Recommendations for the prevention of infections,
<br>4. Treatment and prophylaxis of dental infections, 
<br>5. Infections in Pregnancy and 
<br>6. Microbiology
<br> 
<br>The Bugs & Drugs app is well suited for healthcare practitioners looking for an evidence-based mobile reference and provides therapeutic options in a clear, concise manner.
<br> 
<br>Once installed, you do not need internet access to use the content. Internet access is only required for initial installation of the app and to receive updates.
<br> 
<br>The content is prepared by Dr. Edith Blondel-Hill (Medical Microbiologist/Infectious Diseases Specialist, Kelowna General Hospital) and Ms. Susan Fryters (Antimicrobial Stewardship/Infectious Diseases Pharmacist, Alberta Health Services) with the help of over 40 reviewers with expertise in infectious diseases, infection prevention & control, microbiology, pharmacy, and Public Health.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [http://bugsanddrugs.ca](http://bugsanddrugs.ca) |
| **Email** | bugsanddrugs@albertahealthservices.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [10101 Southport Rd SW Calgary Alberta T3A 5H4](https://www.google.com/maps/search/10101%20Southport%20Rd%20SW%20Calgary%20Alberta%20T3A%205H4) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Content is great but the UI had suffered since 2.0 upgrade (user interface downgrade in my opinion). The app freezes every time I try to search content. I suggest find go back to the old app which was awesome!<br> :date: __2021-03-16 21:48:04__
