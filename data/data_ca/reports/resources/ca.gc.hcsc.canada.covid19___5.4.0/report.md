### Description
> Canada COVID-19 is designed for you to stay informed about COVID-19 in Canada and determine what actions and next steps you should take.  Recommendations are personalized and based on your personal risk factors.  You will receive timely updates with important news and alerts from Canadaâ€™s Ministry of Health.  Recommendations and content are automatically updated based on the latest guidelines related to COVID-19.
<br>This application has been developed in collaboration with Thrive Health, a Vancouver-based healthcare technology company.  
<br>SAFETY & SECURITY:
<br>You will only be asked to provide your age, postal code, and device location.  The data you provide will be combined with all user data and used to inform the provincial COVID-19 response, and to allow you to receive location-based alerts.
<br>Your data will not be sold. Your data will not be used for any purpose other than health care.
<br>We follow industry best practices for data security and privacy.  The data you provide is always encrypted and is stored in Canada.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good<br> :date: __2020-08-30 14:21:55__

> The app doesn't let you know if you come in contact with someone who has C0VID19. This needs improvement. Otherwise it's a good app.<br> :date: __2020-08-16 08:19:12__

> Its pretty cool but i kinda wish it had it so you can see what are other peoples symptoms are in your area for people using the app.. kinda how snapchat has snap spots in your area. Other then that pretty cool.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 18:40:50__

> More localized COVID-19 info would be useful. Perhaps user should configure first 3 digits of postal code and informed accordingly. In addition, could this app inform us when new releases of the #CovidAlert app are issued (since the notif app does not currently push that kind of useful info)?<br> :date: __2021-01-11 16:42:18__

> I think the app is important, however, everyday it's telling me I have to self isolate every. I haven't reported or have any symptoms, why does it tell me to self isolate?<br> :date: __2021-01-10 19:54:18__

> Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:10:55__

> Mine won't work away from computer<br> :date: __2020-11-10 17:19:45__

> Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of "no symptoms". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 17:55:23__

> Stupid app wont let me send the daily check in results<br> :date: __2020-10-08 08:32:50__

> This is not a be all end all app. It has good information. After you submit your symptoms, you lose the bottom menu (Home, Stats, etc). You have to back out to get to this menu. Not easy to exit the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:44:01__

> For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be "loading" either. It's just text. So what's up?<br> :date: __2020-10-05 20:06:20__

> It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 14:38:34__

> This app tells me every single day with that day's date to self-isolate for 14 days, even though I'm entering NO SYMPTOMS.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:18:16__

> Monotonus doesnt give any relevant info.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 05:40:33__

> Original complaints I have remain since first release: 1) Extremely slow. 2) No proper way to exit app Android 6.0.1.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 23:17:02__

> Super slow, lots of lag and very delayed user input! Not sure what all this app does and is doing, but it seems that 1 minute for tapping 6 times to enter daily checkup info is excessively long and a waste of time. This review took less time than 1 daily checkup.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 17:24:08__

> Crashes<br> :date: __2021-01-11 12:15:36__

> Keeps asking for codes that I don't have, or can't put in as it's a 1 time code.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 18:53:15__

> Good to have app but it is quite slow to load the self check page. Please make it faster<br> :date: __2020-12-02 14:31:08__

> I thought this was the tracker app. It isn't and it really isn't useful<br> :date: __2020-10-07 04:46:06__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-08-11 04:03:41__

> Pretty useless for the user The app is nothing but a questionnaire that might help Health Canada from volunteer self evaluators, but shows no live data of infection risk around me like the Arogya Setu App from India. Privacy superceded public health.<br> :date: __2020-08-06 05:42:16__

> Why does it need access to photos?<br> :date: __2020-08-01 11:55:35__

> Error problems<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:40:00__

> Big brother Spyware. Biggest joke over a 99.99% survival flu. Huge power trip and over reach by authoritarian government allowed by weak people who do not value freedoms and have never experienced hardship in their lives. Creeping normality of tyrannical control. End the lockdown. No more masks. No more tyrannical control.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 08:39:13__

> App does not work!<br> :date: __2021-01-08 17:25:00__

> Tests my patience! If I didn't think it was important to report COVID-19 symptoms, I would never use this app! It is so slow, and I mean slow that you don't know if it has sensed my touch selection or not so you tap again and again! Keeps showing that the app encountered an error when I load this app. Why did you move the Daily Check-In from being the first item on the page when it starts?!<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:44:30__

> Since last update Stats don't update at all like is use to do for every day the stats for the day don't display<br> :date: __2020-12-28 01:23:01__

> "Application error" ...not working<br> :date: __2020-12-27 02:00:19__

> Update to previous post: I uninstalled after clearing data, rebooted phone and reinstalled. As soon as I selected my province I got the "app encountered a error" again. So I got rid of it.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 17:18:38__

> All of a, sudden its crashing every time I open it. It was fine yesterday. I don't suppose an upgrade kludged it?<br> :date: __2020-12-26 03:49:28__
