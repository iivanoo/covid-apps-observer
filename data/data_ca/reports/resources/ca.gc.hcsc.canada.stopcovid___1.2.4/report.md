### Description
> Together, letâ€™s slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.
<br>COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. 
<br>Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. Youâ€™ll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 youâ€™ll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.
<br>Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.
<br>COVID Alert has no way of knowing:
<br>-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services
<br>-your name or address
<br>-the place or time you were near someone
<br>-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed
<br>Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app.
<br>Itâ€™s still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, youâ€™ll find out if you were near them.
<br>COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I love it and encourage everyone to get it! (the latest update was annoying but it was solved)<br> :date: __2021-03-25 02:53:11__

> The Application itself is fine, it works in the background and does what it needs to do without you ever knowing that it was on. The downside to this whole thing is that the roll out and the execution of making this app an essential part of daily life for people during the pandemic was a flop so you don't really need it. Also at some point the app stopped "updating" you on the week that just happened.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 01:59:34__

> Seems like a great idea, if only it worked for people from provinces that have not yet agreed to support it. It doesn't make sense that because my Provincial Government thinks it's not a good idea, that I can't use it anyways, and possibly be warned if others like myself have the app running and get sick.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 06:10:19__

> Learning but not good at this<br> :date: __2021-03-30 19:50:19__

> Still hasn't trickled down to notifications within my city<br> :date: __2021-03-29 15:21:55__

> It does exactly what it says on the tin (it's literally a random number generator). Only docking a star for the nags to turn Bluetooth back on, since my conventional wisdom would be to turn it on when I'm actually in public. Though I've seen a lot of reviews mention this already so that's fair.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 07:43:21__

> I assume it's working properly, but it would be reassuring to have a visible counter that shows how many contact codes have been exchanged. I don't care where or when, but a running count would at least let me know that I'm not the only person in town that has this installed. Edit: it will tell me how many times it's checked for exposures, but how effective will that be if none of the people I've been in contact with have this app installed?<br> :date: __2021-03-23 21:18:14__

> It seems fantastic but it would be nice to know that it ONLY works in Ontario or around infected people from Ontario who have logged their exposure and left the province, for whatever extremely unlikely reason, before you install and finish the tutorial.<br> :date: __2021-04-02 22:06:41__

> Waste of Time, This app is a good concept but you have 2 major problems that you will be unable to overcome. First you are relying on the average person to download the app(which they aren't) and second you are again relying on them to input a code(which they aren't).<br> :date: __2021-03-29 17:13:31__

> As someone working in the healthcare field, I strongly recommend this app for everyone to use. There is however an issue with the app recently where it always sends a reminder notification that "bluetooth is off, unable to check for exposure" multiple times a day. It ends up being very annoying since I only turn off bluetooth at home, with no one else going out.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 18:17:29__

> Why does this app slow my phone down so much? It drains the battery twice as fast, and my phone is about half as fast. Everything lags while this app is running. I love the idea for the app, but this needs to be improved so as to discourage people from uninstalling it.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 01:25:15__

> decent<br> :date: __2021-03-16 04:50:19__

> Does this app give me updates on Tableau for my area. I have it on my computer but can't get it on my phone.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 16:26:52__

> Keeps asking to switch on the phone Bluetooth even though it is always on. Uninstalling as not working but just annoying.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 08:08:52__

> It is 100% voluntary COVID reporting which means that infected people will have to notify the app of their infection. What if they don't?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 21:01:17__

> I think we should be treating covid-19 as if it were a serial killer. I don't want to be told that I've been shot after the fact. If someone receives a positive diagnosis along with the one-time key it should be mandatory to put that key into the app. If that person does not stay at home and I am near them in public places I should receive an immediate buzz on my phone so that I can increase my distance from that person. The Play store screen shows only 1 million plus downloads.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 00:17:41__

> Wakes up my phone every hour and shows a heart attack inducing notification saying it's checking for exposures. Can't disable that without disabling all notifications. Makes no sense. This app makes you live in constant fear. Good idea but poor usability.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 19:52:05__

> Often didn't update or work even when Bluetooth was on<br> :date: __2021-03-26 06:09:51__

> It says that a one time key is not available for my area? But I live in one of the most populated places in BC?<br> :date: __2021-03-23 22:58:23__

> Great idea but poor execution. It's not useful if persons with Covid are not given the codes to report it.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 12:17:13__

> Needs A Lot of Work. The concept is fine but a lot of flaws. I tested positive for Covid and about 3 times every day it tells me to get a new code to share my new exposures. I'm in quarantine for at least 10 days and not going anywhere. I had to turn it off because it was so annoying.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 19:47:09__

> Just hope no one forgets their phone!<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:38:26__

> I have had this App on my phone since 08/20. Do to the nature of my job I frequent Toronto and Ottawa, both hot spots. Here we are in March, 6 months of using this app, yet not one single notification. I highly doubt it's effectiveness.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 16:19:06__

> Great idea, but only 5 people in Canada are using it. Canada doesn't know how to reach out to its masses and connect with them on a personal level<br> :date: __2021-02-23 01:23:19__

> Not sure how useful this app is... This app is like the notorious pet rock - either does nothing or appears to do nothing. It would give a better sense of reliability if it reported to me how many other unique devices my phone came in the vicinity of and how many devices are reporting in the preceeding 24h period in my province / city. This app is worse than useless if I am the only one using it in all of Ontario. I'd rather free up space & release the processing power that this app is wasting.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 18:06:07__

> What is the point of this app if it doesn't do what it's designed to do?? I was sitting right next to someone who was covid positive and got no alert. Now I'm covid positive, and still no alert. What a joke. Deleting this garbage<br> :date: __2021-04-02 21:48:12__

> Doesn't even work!!! I've been in contact. And got covid. The person even put in the app code!!! It still shows I haven't been exposed. Realllllyyyyy?!?!? I'M COVID POSTIVE LOL I also know they did it because I made them get the app and enter their code....<br> :date: __2021-04-02 04:59:17__
