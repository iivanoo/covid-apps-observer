## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very easy to use and during these covid times its great to talk to a doctor in the safety of your own home, especially for little issues.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 03:53:30__

> I really loved using the app! As someone with anxiety it was really nice not having to leave my apartment, I was definitely more relaxed then if I went to a doctors. I didn't have wait long too. My appointment was at 12:30 and the doctor came in a few minutes later. Even if they are behind atleast you are at home.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 23:45:21__

> Great experience!<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:42:00__

> Great stuff<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:57:37__

> I was skeptical that I was going to see a doctor, get a prescription and all for free.... ask me how great it felt to actually see a doctor, get a prescription for free and not have to wait in a room with 20 other people but actually be at home in my PJ's! I had Dr. Bucko and she was great, I will use this app again & again instead of leaving the house that's for sure!<br> :date: __2020-12-15 02:45:04__

> All staff was professional and very helpful. The doctor was friendly, knowledgable and willing to answer all questions. I highly recommend using this service.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 03:50:48__

> Great app and really fast service would recommend to everyone<br> :date: __2020-10-30 23:15:09__

> This was amazing. It was a little laggy but my internet is quite slow. So great to have access to medical care within 2 hours of me asking for an appointment! Thanks Lumeca!<br> :date: __2020-05-18 22:31:02__

> The app sucks but the doctors are great<br> :date: __2020-04-19 05:14:57__

> My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those. The nurse was nice and the doctor was nice.<br> :date: __2020-04-13 20:27:50__

> Honestly just not very useful. Docrtos and their support dont communicate enough and I constantly have to follow up but the application doesn't allow you to follow up with the doctor and you have to constantly start new consultations.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 23:57:33__

> The app won't even complete my account set up. I enter my passwords and hit the next button and nothing.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 19:55:00__

> Just keeps spinning...I have no idea if I'm in queue or what is happening, if anything.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 05:49:43__

> I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 17:04:30__

> Won't allow me to start a (non-covid related) conusltation. It says "an error occurred while starting your consultation" and boots me back to the home page.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 19:09:18__

> Does this not run on Android 10? It won't run as it says it's only supported on "unmodified" versions. I haven't modified it. I only ever update it per the regular updates.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 19:19:35__

> Thia app will not let you get past the account creation.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 20:39:13__

> I'm trying to connect with a nurse and my messages keep saying error. I can see is asking me questions but I'm unable to respond. I tried logging out and deleting the app then downloading it. Still has fixed the problem.<br> :date: __2020-04-04 16:21:47__
