### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>‚Ä¢ Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>‚Ä¢ Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Geolocation data is not collected by the app or by Alberta Health Services. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well my old pixel 2 xl and my current pixel 5. No noticeable battery issues or crashing. Had it up an running in less then 3min.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 00:13:36__

> Seems good so far. I have been running the App for 12 Hrs, and the phone claims it's consuming 1.1% of all battery usage. I would hope most of negative reviews arn't a partisan attack, because it will deter more people from using the app, which will render it useless. Do your part folks!<br> :date: __2020-12-03 18:53:38__

> EDIT: *NO LONGER A BATTERY DRAINER* It seems something was updated. Version 1.4 Get back to work, 'Berta. (Previous Review: Battery drainer. The only way to reasonably use the app is to turn it on around others. Otherwise, not a "set it, forget it" solution. The overall function of the app is clearly explained, and is fine to use when needed. No crashes, flawless app persistence.)<br> :date: __2020-11-13 00:17:06__

> Sometimes it eats battery. Not sure why. Otherwise just sits there<br> :date: __2020-11-12 08:20:45__

> Flawless installation and just works away in the background consuming very little battery. Every Albertan should be installing this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 01:25:41__

> It works. This app works and does not crash. If you're worried about battery life, you can do more by turning down your screen brightness than by not using this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 05:36:10__

> Good app, does not drain my battery and provide me with some sort of security that If I am close to someone infected i will know. We all that live in Alberta should use it thanks<br> :date: __2020-10-16 06:19:47__

> So far so good<br> :date: __2020-10-08 14:48:14__

> Helps me as I don't have short term memory.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 17:08:45__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-10-07 04:06:08__

> Seems to work fine. Unfortunately it is set to "Canada only" so my sister cant install it on her US phone despite living here.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 03:29:29__

> It doesn't drain my battery like others say. Not sure why others are having issues...?<br> :date: __2020-08-17 21:50:04__

> No issues with the app (Samsung Note 9).<br> :date: __2020-08-10 04:24:28__

> I noticed the last 2 days this app has been draining my battery. Use to have 45% left at bedtime, now only 10% at 1 pm. Just did the update, which I didn't know about. So hopefully it fixes this battery issue. (03-Jun-20). UPDATE: After the update the app no longer drained my battery. I noticed a drain on my battery again today (06-Jul-20) and checked for an update, which there was. If you notice your battery being drained, just update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 16:07:00__

> I originally thought the app was draining my battery but it turned out to be something else. It seems to work fine and is unobtrusive except for the always on tray notification.<br> :date: __2020-07-05 16:46:23__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 11:14:09__

> I have uninstalled this app. I was the early adopter of this app but now that the national app is available, I want to switch over to that one. I have uninstalled it to voice my option and hopefully my Alberta government will see the drop-off installment of this app to take appropriate action.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 16:52:14__

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 06:33:13__

> Huuuge battery drainer.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:41:00__

> I'm tired of being asked if I'm ok. Why am I asked multiple times a day? Is it because I'm around or could have contact exposure? Asking me multiple times a day is causing me anxiety.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:17:15__

> App is useless when I am travelling outside of province. Alberta, SWITCH TO THE FEDERAL COVID APP!!!<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:19__

> It is probably not the apps fault but I live in b.x. now and could never understand it .. stay safe<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:11:04__

> It has been a good app for now.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 05:20:33__

> It's irritating that it has a large notification on my screen all the time to note that it's running, rather than an icon, or the option to just run in the background without that. Worse, it drains my battery, using as much power as almost everything else I run combined. I'd like to use it, but this isn't feasible.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 01:11:47__

> Extreme battery usage on a Pixel 2. Want to keep it don't know what to do<br> :date: __2020-08-20 06:30:42__

> Ok not great<br> :date: __2020-11-19 22:23:04__

> As others have said, it's like the federal government app but worse. They should just make both available to Albertans and let us decide. My choice would be easy.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 23:44:19__

> I feel it's a good idea, implemented poorly. Within an hour of 100% battery I am down to 85%. Not well designed. It's not right for me... I have uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:00:11__

> Horrible battery drain. UCP should smarten up and do things well instead of cheaply.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 23:44:44__

> I am still getting a notice that says "if you are getting this message please restart your phone" I did and the message came right back. Glad we are spending thousands on this app Kenny.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 06:15:49__

> Alberta needs to stop fighting with the Federal Government and merge this app with the national app. Which is why this won't run in the background...feds are blocking the ability with Google.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 04:24:05__

> I appreciate the effort Alberta made to get this out so quickly, but it's time to switch the Federal system which is more reliable, comprehensive, and easier on my battery. Uninstalling as there not enough people using this anyway.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 04:03:34__

> There hasnt been any action on here<br> :date: __2020-10-07 17:02:38__

> Horrible app drains battery. Also ineffective. Please create a National app uses Google / Apple API<br> :date: __2020-10-05 23:15:57__

> How are supposed to trace the virus if the app is not compatible with older Android version .you need to have at least Android version 8 . That's very not smart.<br> :date: __2020-09-22 20:00:04__

> What gives this provincial government the audacity to intentionally block a proven federal tool that can aide my health and relieve the burden of your provincial failures? Communist China had more options than you are allowing us.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 15:05:57__

> Well on the downside it doesn't work at all. But on the plus side it drains my battery so I can't spend as much time learning what a terrible job Kenney is doing with the pandemic. I call it a lose-lose situation<br> :date: __2020-12-05 05:47:32__

> Doesn't communicate with iPhones. Doesn't work in background mode. Drains battery. Doesn't work without contact tracers who aren't tracing general population. Non functional app.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 21:45:54__

> IS ANYBODY ELSE USING THIS APP? I did find a way to run this app on my Android 8 that doesn't kill the battery and is not taking up the notification bar by displaying a huge notification area. And yes it is still running in the background.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:16:51__
