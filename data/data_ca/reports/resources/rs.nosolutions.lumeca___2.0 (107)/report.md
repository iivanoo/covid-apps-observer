## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was very easy to sign up and add other family members. Got a response quickly and discreetly in the privacy of my own home.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 20:18:54__

> Very helpful and caring Coordinators and very easy to use. I had a very good experience with a Doctor who did not mind explaining things to me. If needed, I will not hesitate to use this again.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 14:45:14__

> Excellent experience. It was professional, very well administered and timely. The Dr. was very friendly and warm.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 19:46:34__

> The app is quick, easy, safe. The doctor that was assigned was very knowledgeable on my issue, and I would recommend the app over a mediclinic as it's faster and more convenient. The staff who set the appointment are very friendly and easy to talk to.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 19:25:39__

> Great service.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 14:37:28__

> Omg. I use to dread having to go to the doctors office. Wait 2 hours (for a scheduled appointment no less) for a 2 second prescription refill. Love that I can do it from home. And it's free!<br> :date: __2021-03-01 01:11:37__

> What a great app! I downloaded it, registered my account and spoke with a doctor all within 2 hours. Very impressed. I will definitely use this service again.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 19:30:36__

> This application is amazing! I was able to meet virtually with a fantastic doctor on a Sunday morning when my regular clinic was closed. Immediately after our meeting, my pharmacy recieved the fax for my prescription and I was able to pick it up later that day. I will definitely be recommending this app to others! A wonderful solution for those trying to stay home and stay safe during covid.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 19:01:54__

> Very easy to use!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 15:45:22__

> This was amazing. It was a little laggy but my internet is quite slow. So great to have access to medical care within 2 hours of me asking for an appointment! Thanks Lumeca!<br> :date: __2020-05-18 22:31:02__

> The app sucks but the doctors are great<br> :date: __2020-04-19 05:14:57__

> My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those. The nurse was nice and the doctor was nice.<br> :date: __2020-04-13 20:27:50__

> This app just keeps closing every time I go to the consultation<br> :date: __2021-03-11 20:20:14__

> They will not help you the slightest bit if you don't have a camera.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 17:30:11__

> Honestly just not very useful. Docrtos and their support dont communicate enough and I constantly have to follow up but the application doesn't allow you to follow up with the doctor and you have to constantly start new consultations.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 23:57:33__

> The app won't even complete my account set up. I enter my passwords and hit the next button and nothing.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 19:55:00__

> Just keeps spinning...I have no idea if I'm in queue or what is happening, if anything.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 05:49:43__

> I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 17:04:30__

> Won't allow me to start a (non-covid related) conusltation. It says "an error occurred while starting your consultation" and boots me back to the home page.<br> :date: __2020-05-14 19:09:18__

> Does this not run on Android 10? It won't run as it says it's only supported on "unmodified" versions. I haven't modified it. I only ever update it per the regular updates.<br> :date: __2020-04-23 19:19:35__

> Thia app will not let you get past the account creation.<br> :date: __2020-04-10 20:39:13__

> I'm trying to connect with a nurse and my messages keep saying error. I can see is asking me questions but I'm unable to respond. I tried logging out and deleting the app then downloading it. Still has fixed the problem.<br> :date: __2020-04-04 16:21:47__
