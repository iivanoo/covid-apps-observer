### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. The app does not capture or use information about your location. In addition, location data is not collected by Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services and is never sent from your phone to another organization for any purpose. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Additionally, ABTraceTogether uses the smartphone MAC address solely for the one-time generation of a device ID to allow required communication between ABTraceTogether and the server. The MAC address is not transmitted, shared, stored, or used for any kind of personal data or user tracking.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The app (on android) started using a lot of battery capacity, so I force-stopped it and restarted my phone. Now it is fine. The only reason the app does not receive more stars is that it is not in use by enough people.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 21:51:13__

I have uninstalled it to voice my option and hopefully my Alberta government will see the drop-off installment of this app to take appropriate action.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 16:52:14__

> I have had this app for over a year and so far not once have I had an elert. Is it because I have not come into close contact with someone ( which I have) or is it because those people may of not had the app?<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:32:02__

> I haven't had the same problems with crashes that many people describe but after the last update battery usage has greatly increased. In the last week or so that has greatly accelerated and it uses over 25% even when I'm actively using my phone. I have an iPhone for work and the same thing is now happening there. I suspect malware. Whatever, neither phone now makes it through a day. Uninstalling<br> :date: __2021-05-29 16:52:49__

> Battery problems- excessively uses battery power since the last update. Consumed almost 75% of battery total charge since my last charge over the space of one day.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 00:48:32__

> The app has been running very well for the past year or so until the latest update, now it drains the phone's battery on half a day, where previously I charged every other day, it needs fixing.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 06:57:40__

> While it is Easy to install and no noticeable battery drain ... The low uptake makes it useless. The govt sucked at the rollout. Shame on you<br> :date: __2021-05-20 01:33:18__

> I have yet to receive an alert, although I have had the app up and running for over a year.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 20:32:03__

> This app should be linked with the Canada wide Covid app.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 16:29:03__

> Battery usage went from less than 5% to 35% with the new update. Unacceptable, had to delete app.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 05:11:38__

> With this software installed, my phone will be dead by morning, every night. This has been my experience- nearly every morning this past month I have missed my alarms from my phone because even on a full charge at the time i go to sleep, it will have expired by the time i want to get up. I never was exposed to covid in the duration that I had this software installed, so i can't attest to its functionality, other than that it consumed a lot of resources on my phone such that i had to remove it.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 18:20:46__

> Recent changes made my battery life worst. Background battery usage jumped dramatically where it would drain battery overnight while I sleep. This was not happening in past. In my opinion I think the new additions from last update are causing drain. Maybe it is constantly hitting servers to grab statistics.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:34:09__

> Would have preferred the Canada wide one<br> :date: __2021-06-10 23:49:35__

> I bought a new phone in part so that I could use this app as part of my Covid-19 risk mitigation strategy. I no longer recommend this app. Since the April update it has been drawing enough power to damage my phone through deep discharges. It no longer lasts a full day even after replacing the swollen battery. A lack of news coverage on the change tells me few people actually use the app. You are more likely to get hits with the federal app (not active in AB), which only uses 1% battery per day.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 18:55:59__

> Worst parody app ever.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 03:07:55__

> Drained my battery, diagnostic showed the app used over 35% of the battery and all background use<br> :date: __2021-05-31 06:32:41__

> I was tested COVID + and had the Berta App running. Through the contact tracing and phone calls I received from AHS, not one person asked if I used the App nor did anyone assign or share the code I needed to use the AB Trace App abilities. So why were we ever encouraged to download if it's purpose isn't followed through?<br> :date: __2021-05-29 22:19:59__

> I wanted this to work. The province spent millions. I've met with thousands of people over the year with this running and not a single notification. App is broken<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:45:56__

> Recently, the app has been using more and more battery. It used to use less than 1%, now it's around 25-45% depending on the day.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 05:03:02__

> The app is the shats. Get people who know how to do it right.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:37:30__

> Drained battery, when I uploadedy data after catching Covid no one got an alert. Does not work.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:18:06__

> Um, this thing has never notified me and I've been in contact with several Covid cases. 4 tests and lucky so far, but not because of this app.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 02:22:59__
