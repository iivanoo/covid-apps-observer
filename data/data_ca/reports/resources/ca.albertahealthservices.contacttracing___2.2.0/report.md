### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. The app does not capture or use information about your location. In addition, location data is not collected by Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services and is never sent from your phone to another organization for any purpose. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Additionally, ABTraceTogether uses the smartphone MAC address solely for the one-time generation of a device ID to allow required communication between ABTraceTogether and the server. The MAC address is not transmitted, shared, stored, or used for any kind of personal data or user tracking.
<br>Copyright 2021 Government of Alberta

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of the Province of Alberta |
| **Website**  | [http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether](http://alberta.ca/ABTraceTogether) |
| **Email** | ABTraceTogetherSupport@gov.ab.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [3720 - 76 Avenue Edmonton, AB T6B 2N9](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3720%20-%2076%20Avenue%20Edmonton,%20AB%20T6B%202N9) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Government+of+the+Province+of+Alberta) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A good safeguard. But too bad underutilized<br> :date: __2021-04-16 21:38:23__

> On January 29, 2021, developers advised that app can now download from US PlayStore. Previous comments related to now fixed issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 23:05:02__

> The app (on android) started using a lot of battery capacity, so I force-stopped it and restarted my phone. Now it is fine. The only reason the app does not receive more stars is that it is not in use by enough people.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 21:51:13__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 11:14:09__

> I have uninstalled this app. I was the early adopter of this app but now that the national app is available, I want to switch over to that one. I have uninstalled it to voice my option and hopefully my Alberta government will see the drop-off installment of this app to take appropriate action.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 16:52:14__

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 06:33:13__

> I'm tired of being asked if I'm ok. Why am I asked multiple times a day? Is it because I'm around or could have contact exposure? Asking me multiple times a day is causing me anxiety.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:17:15__

> App is useless when I am travelling outside of province. Alberta, SWITCH TO THE FEDERAL COVID APP!!!<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:28:19__

> It is probably not the apps fault but I live in b.x. now and could never understand it .. stay safe<br> :date: __2020-10-07 13:11:04__

> Battery usage went from less than 5% to 35% with the new update. Unacceptable, had to delete app.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 05:11:38__

> With this software installed, my phone will be dead by morning, every night. This has been my experience- nearly every morning this past month I have missed my alarms from my phone because even on a full charge at the time i go to sleep, it will have expired by the time i want to get up. I never was exposed to covid in the duration that I had this software installed, so i can't attest to its functionality, other than that it consumed a lot of resources on my phone such that i had to remove it.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 18:20:46__

> New update uses about 48% of my battery, prompting a premature battery drain warning. I wish AB and BC would set asside the NIH syndrome, and just enable the federal contact tracing app (which I have installed, but is usless to me unless I encounter somebody from outside AB and BC. Edit: Reinstalling the app approximately doubled the run-time, but it still uses more power than any other app on my phone: including the federal contact tracing app.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 09:05:43__

> Recent changes made my battery life worst. Background battery usage jumped dramatically where it would drain battery overnight while I sleep. This was not happening in past. In my opinion I think the new additions from last update are causing drain. Maybe it is constantly hitting servers to grab statistics.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:34:09__

> The AB Government should have been in with the federal Covid App<br> :date: __2021-01-21 22:49:14__

> Idea is great, but for many weeks I used this app whenever I went out, and nothing was happening. Wasn't sure what was going on, maybe I was just safe. Then I found out, that in fact, there was actually nothing going on, this app wasn't working, and did nothing for a long time after its release. For an app that some people trust with their lives, literally, it sure sucks.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 15:22:50__

> The app keeps asking me to restart my phone. I have done so at least five times now. That notification is very annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 21:48:46__

> Ok not great<br> :date: __2020-11-19 22:23:04__

> As others have said, it's like the federal government app but worse. They should just make both available to Albertans and let us decide. My choice would be easy.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 23:44:19__

> I feel it's a good idea, implemented poorly. Within an hour of 100% battery I am down to 85%. Not well designed. It's not right for me... I have uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 04:00:11__

> Hey why not use what the rest of Canada is using?! Tell your MP their stubbornness is killing Albertans! This waste of taxpayer $$ can't be salvaged but they should still authorize the federal app! Meantime you can download that one anyways - it works if you sign in as a different province like SK.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 23:48:28__

> FIX THIS NOW! App just told me I needed to UPDATE BUT Only because I accidentally clicked the icon. (strike 1) It has gone from using maybe 2-3% battery in a day to that in an hour! (strike 2 & 3) My phone went from 100% to 80% in 2 hours of just sitting there and looking at the battery usage this app was nearly 6%! Compare that to the play store app and the same time frame was 1%.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 17:51:26__

> Unusable after the most recent update. Crashes if Bluetooth is enabled. Can't even tell if it's running, or just killing my battery with constant app crashes and restarts. I've tried everything. After it's set up with my phone number, I can never open the app again, it just sits forever on a blank screen. I'd love to do my part and help the contract tracers, but this app is not the solution it should have been. Uninstalling again. I'll try again after the next update.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 23:48:31__

> Never ever have i had an alert. Is this thing on?<br> :date: __2021-05-03 17:40:01__

> this app is garbage<br> :date: __2021-05-01 22:43:20__

> I don't understand how this app is supposed to stop the spread of covid?? what exactly is the app supposed to do?<br> :date: __2021-05-01 07:54:08__

> Excessive battery drain.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 16:43:09__

> Huge battery drain for an app that the stubborn Alberta government insists works because they don't want to find a solution with the federal government.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:34:34__

> Uninstalled this app since the new update it drains my battery. Need to fix app before reinstalling<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:36:52__

> So far doesnt seem to work. Never rec any info<br> :date: __2021-04-27 00:33:57__
