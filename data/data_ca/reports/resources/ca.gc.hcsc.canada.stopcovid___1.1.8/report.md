### Description
> Together, let‚Äôs slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.
<br>COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. 
<br>Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. You‚Äôll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you‚Äôll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.
<br>Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.
<br>COVID Alert has no way of knowing:
<br>-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services
<br>-your name or address
<br>-the place or time you were near someone
<br>-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed
<br>Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app.
<br>It‚Äôs still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, you‚Äôll find out if you were near them.
<br>COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

> Turning bluetooth off and back on disables the app, at least on my device. I need to open the app and reactivate it manually everytime bluetooth has been disabled momentarily. Edit : Issue was fixed in December update. App works great now.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 15:36:39__

> I love the fact that our country will work to get virus dealt with, but I will always remember that they were the very people that sent covid 19 onto our Fair planet in the first place.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 04:57:40__

> Works well if everyone uses it<br> :date: __2021-01-17 20:22:59__

> How an app that is designed to save lives gets a 3.4 rating and yet video games that don't mean much at the end of the day get a 4.0 rating is beyond my understanding. I can only assume that some conspiracy theorists who think covid is a hoax or that the government wants to control us have given some very poor ratings. The premise behind this app seems quite simple so unless it is not picking up other people's codes properly then I can't see what issues could cause it to get a 3.4.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:00:19__

> Great app. I trust it and hope it will alert me if needed.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 00:50:32__

> Samsung S8 Android 9, Covid 1.1.6 Seems to check consistently after changing Settings>apps>special access> optimize battery usage > turn off for Covid alert<br> :date: __2021-01-19 05:51:10__

> Like many others, I was pretty disappointed to find out that despite what this page says, it DOES require your device GPS/location services to be on. As soon as I turned it off, this app produces a warning that "Covid-19 alert is off". When you turn it on, it says "your phone needs to use Bluetooth to securely collect and share random IDs with other phones...", but then when you click continue, it says, "turn on the device location settings"... "The device location settings needs to be on for Bluetooth to detect nearby devices that have exposure notifications on...." So, no matter what you do, this app requires both Bluetooth AND GPS. Aside from that... we're in a pandemic and there are worse things to worry about, so I still encourage people to use it as it does help save lives and stop Covid.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 10:25:43__

> Does what it says and protects privacy.. I would however like the option to turn on of off the exposure check notification, I found that more of a peace of mind thing when I did see it.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 02:30:37__

> I'm glad to have it. But.. it is limited in its use as we can not put it on our older organizations iPhones which we have, numerous model 6. Requires higher iOS version than iPhone 6 supports<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:03:58__

> Update #2: The app finally appears to be working properly. Exposure checks are happening 3+ times per day, even without opening the app. Update: I spoke to soon. The showed exposure checks for a few days but stopped on the 28th. After I opened the app the logs showed a dozen or so checks in the last minute, but nothing since then. Is the app just not uploading IDs when it's closed or is it not sending out bluetooth beacons as well? Both situations aren't ideal but the latter is very worrying to me. EDIT: The problem I described below appears to have been fixed. I now see multiple checks per day, even without opening the app. I'm not convinced the app is checking for exposure and/or running in the background. The exposure log (settings->google->covid19->exposure checks) only shows checks after the app is opened. If I don't open the app for days or weeks and check the logs again, the most recent check lines up exactly with the last time the app was opened. I tried uninstalling-reinstalling and saw no change in behaviour. I've read that the app constantly checks for exposure as long as there is internet access but that doesn't seem to be happening on my device.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 03:24:20__

> Seems to work but the notification that is shown when it's searching for exposures should be disabled by default. With this on, it wakes up the screen and is just annoying. Just tell us if there is an actual exposure detected.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 23:31:24__

> Feel it gives me a good comfort level. Am 81 and appreciate any help to stay safe. Blessings.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 22:09:05__

> Finally app is doing constant exposure checks<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:15:28__

> It could be very nice, but I am not sure that people testing covid positive really enter a code in the app unfortunately... I never got any alert... I understand how it works but I doubt that there's a lot of people honest enough to enter their code in it for real. That's what I meant.. ;) Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-12-22 04:05:38__

> Not enough people using the app. Have been to various places with outbreak without any notice form the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 07:02:40__

> l have this app on my Android phone, & it works fine. I am very disapointed that the app is still not available 4 my Samsung/Android devices. I would think great effort would be put in2 making sure all mainstream devices are included, 2 help protect everyone from this hideous, life robbing desease! *In response 2 the developer: Samsung IS an Android phone, running Android 10 OS, with Google Play always up 2 date. As 1 of the biggest makers of Android devices, that leaves a lot of people out!<br> :date: __2021-01-22 21:15:48__

> Would be a lot more effective if it did not require location services to be on. I usually keep location services off to save battery, and forget to turn it on (for this app) when I leave the house.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 00:05:06__

> Edited: Fixed. To get people to use this is still nearly impossible task and almost most certainly not going to be effective tool in anyway sadly<br> :date: __2021-01-16 11:41:51__

> This is a great idea.Unfortunately, this app drains my battery very fast. I have a newer phone and my battery usually lasts a day and a half with moderate usage. After two days of having the app, I've had to turn off my location and Bluetooth during my work hours to extend my battery to the end of my day. From 8:00am to 11:00am, my battery dropped from 100% to 80% with very little personal usage. With a newer phone, this shouldn't be happening. Before I installed the app, this was not a problem.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 01:27:36__

> Great concept. But 2 things...I wish I had known about it sooner...how many people would comply if they knew it existed. More advertising needed. 2...I never use my location data. I don't believe it's safe. This app should be able to work without it when its bluetooth connected. I read other reviews that said the same, and the answer was it should work without it, u just need the newest version. Well I just downloaded today and it wants my location. I'm not comfortable with that.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 07:38:31__

> I just heard that COVID Alert fails to work in British Columbia, Canada.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 07:42:45__

> Doesn't work for me, keeps demanding an update to Google play services which doesn't appear valid. Google pixel 2, all updates. Edit: everything was up to date, app and play services. Did a force stop on the app and it's working now.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 16:49:14__

> I dont understand how this will ever work of it keeps turning itself off. I check everyday and have to turn the stupid thing back on.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 00:20:38__

> I no longer have an exposure log in google after recent update. No longer exists to check if the app is checking or not. So I don't know if if the app is working or not. Before the update it checked twice a day. Now ..? I have already said this-reply sent by app developer said to check my exposure log...how when it's not there? I am on Android 11 and app updated few days ago. So now what?<br> :date: __2021-01-21 21:27:19__

> Would be great to use even without data or wifi so I know who is having symptoms of coronavirus. I need to keep myself safe as I am looking after the elderly and disabled.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 08:23:37__

> Doesn't work in my province (BC). It has says reporting isn't available in my area since I downloaded this app in 2020. Good concept, but it doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:29:40__

> Questionable. I downloaded back in september. I used to get a notification every week with a report, lasted a few weeks. Then i heard you have to check your app every day so it doesnt shut off. I used to be able to check the app in google settings, told me when it last checked, and how many interactions. No more. I dont really know if this app even works. Seems it was made by someone with little knowledge. I keep it running with the hope it is working, but have little faith.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 22:09:28__

> The app will only notify you of an exposure IF the exposed person puts in his code! And only if you are around for 15 minutes and ONLY when the apps algorithm suspects the individual is contagious....... literally useless, it relies on people to self report which is impossible, no one wants the stigma, additionally there is no scientific established research that it takes 15 minutes for an exposure to deem someone "exposed" it could be 30 seconds or less. Good attempt but bad execution!<br> :date: __2021-01-11 19:57:18__

> For someone #StayingAtHome, for the last 10 months to limit contacts, this app is of limited value. More money should be spent on helping with contact tracing since that may be more effective at steming the spread of COVID19.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 17:26:11__

> Just writing a review to report an issue. My phone stopped doing exposure checks 3 days ago (4 Jan 2021). Looks like that coincides with an update. I think something broke. Running on Android 8.0.0<br> :date: __2021-01-07 20:00:22__

> I see a comment from Dec 30th that the major flaw is that location settings need to be on. The response from the developer is that the user just needs to update the app. I just installed it (Jan 7th) and it is asking for location settings to be on. ...Not sure what the developer means, if I don't turn on the location, the app will not run.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:12:26__

> Great concept but the app is ineffective when Bluetooth or data is off? Why doesn't it have the option to manually enter where you were if it was turned off / battery died? Also, there should be a wider exposure range of reporting than within 6ft for at least 15 minutes.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:39:13__

> It's a good app, but it has a major flaw: it depends on people reporting that they have a positive covid test in order for it to work. There are many articles that reported almost no one who has tested positive actually reported on the app. This app is next to useless. Save your storage space<br> :date: __2021-01-20 00:27:02__

> As others have mentioned the app wants my location on to operate. I can't update Android operating system to 11.0, which apparently is required for Covid alert to not need your location. I'm assuming I can't get AOS 11.0 because my phone is older. Too bad. I'd think this eliminates a lot of people. I keep location turned off and don't want to turn it on for this.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 03:23:35__

> EDIT: re-downloaded the app to see if anything has changed, and it says there's no reporting in my area and that I should keep checking back for when people CAN make a report! So even if someone right next to me had covid they couldn't alert me through this app at all! Literally doesn't do anything, just forces you to keep your location and Bluetooth on all day to waste battery.

> After several emails posts online and my initial review this app has been updated to obfuscate your ability to know if it's working. They removed the ability for you to check and confirm if it actually works. Previously it's completely random . It could go weeks or days between checks. Why you removed the ability for users to see when it last checked for a covid exposure smacks of hiding the failures of this app. Why did you remove our ability to see when it last checked for an exposure?<br> :date: __2021-01-17 23:41:08__

> A family member received an exposure notification and promptly went to get tested.
