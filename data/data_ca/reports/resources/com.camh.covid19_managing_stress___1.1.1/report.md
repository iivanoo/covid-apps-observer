## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My only in-person experience as a patient: got a referral, then saw a doctor who promised to help and then, when I had an emergency, he passed me over to another agency that refused his referral. This app perfectly mimics the uselessness of that encounter, including having a 'discussion forum' that's only open during business hours. Everything on the app can be found with a web search. Don't waste your time downloading it.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 13:48:58__

> The app contains reading material only and is not interactive in any way. Once you read the material, the app is useless. This would be better positioned on a website.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 15:36:29__
