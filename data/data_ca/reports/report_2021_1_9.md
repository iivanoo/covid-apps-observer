## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Province of British Columbia, Canada |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | support@thrive.health |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access approximate location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

> The app recommended I get tested. I already know where the nearest testing centre is so I thought that was it, just show up. Nothing in the testing instructions was said about making an appointment until I drilled down to search the location for hours of operation. There in tiny tiny letters it says 'Appointment Required'. The finder app uses Chrome. Clicking on the text field pops up the keyboard and then closes it. So you can't type in your location to search. Pixel 3XL, Android 10<br> :date: __2020-06-14 02:55:44__

> I like it so far. I think we should see a provincial breakdown map by region. Use the self-check and government data to populate the map.<br> :date: __2020-03-27 06:58:15__

> The assessment needs a better breakdown of symptoms. For example there are ways to distinguish between whether you are just experiencing seasonal allergies or actual Covid 19. Adding a few more questions would improve the value of the assessment and people will be less skeptical of its accuracy.<br> :date: __2020-03-24 21:21:54__

> Useless. Absolute trash. The app recommends contact tracing, yet doesn't provide it lol 😆. The app gives no localized case data, you know, the data required to make intelligent risk assessments, lol 😆. This app does nothing, and is the only tool available to the middle and under class.

### Description
> This app is being brought to you by the Government of Alberta.
<br>This app is intended for ages 14+.
<br>Some of the key benefits of this app are to:
<br>• Augment our current contact tracing efforts to provide guidance and care to those who are or may be infected
<br>• Help keep Albertans safe by limiting the spread of COVID-19 through more individuals self-isolating earlier
<br>The app is most effective if it reaches a strong penetration of usage among Albertans, which means the more people that use the app, the better the app works.
<br>Once a user registers their phone number with the app, the app uses bluetooth to log contact with other individuals who have the app when that contact is within approximately 2 meters. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they will be contacted by an Alberta Health Service Contact Tracer, and asked to voluntarily upload their data to Alberta Health Services so that anyone the user came into close contact with over the previous 14 days can be notified.
<br>Location permissions are required by the application because Android/Google requires apps requesting access to Bluetooth to also obtain location permission. The app does not capture or use information about your location. In addition, location data is not collected by Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services and is never sent from your phone to another organization for any purpose. The Bluetooth exchange ID log data collected is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. This data will not be accessed by Alberta Health Services unless and until you choose to upload it as a result of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Mobile numbers or any other personal information are not revealed to other app users.
<br>Personal Information collected:
<br>- Phone number
<br>Permissions required:
<br>- Bluetooth enabled
<br>- Location 
<br>- Push notifications
<br>Copyright 2020 Government of Alberta

> I believe in anything created by our saviour Jason "the king" Kenny. May this app save Alberta from economic ruin.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 07:29:58__

> 2nd Review: No problem with battery, 5 days 19 hrs used 9.2%. Minimal to assist Contact Tracing! Sept 4/20: My phone is 3 1/2, in a 12 hr period the battery usage was only 0.7%. My only complaint is that it shows an icon in my status bar regardless if Bluetooth is on or off. I would prefer that the icon only shows when Bluetooth is off. Until we get the National app here at least it's one thing I can do. Who knows when we'll get the National one!?! Hopefully sooner than later!<br> :date: __2020-12-29 22:50:28__

> Works well my old pixel 2 xl and my current pixel 5. No noticeable battery issues or crashing. Had it up an running in less then 3min.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 00:13:36__

> Seems good so far. I have been running the App for 12 Hrs, and the phone claims it's consuming 1.1% of all battery usage. I would hope most of negative reviews arn't a partisan attack, because it will deter more people from using the app, which will render it useless.

The only way to reasonably use the app is to turn it on around others. Otherwise, not a "set it, forget it" solution.

> I noticed the last 2 days this app has been draining my battery. Use to have 45% left at bedtime, now only 10% at 1 pm. Just did the update, which I didn't know about. So hopefully it fixes this battery issue. (03-Jun-20). UPDATE: After the update the app no longer drained my battery. I noticed a drain on my battery again today (06-Jul-20) and checked for an update, which there was. If you notice your battery being drained, just update the app.<br> :date: __2020-07-06 16:07:00__

> Applies to build 1.5.0. United States visitors will find the app will not download from PlayStore. Do not know if same issue exists with iPhone. Several workarounds. Need to set PlayStore to Canada site. (1) Google has an option to change country for apps. States cannot change back for a year. (2) Can reset your phone and then apply for a new Google account once in Alberta. (3) Buy a prepaid phone which I did. Do not sign into your US Google account.

> I have uninstalled this app. I was the early adopter of this app but now that the national app is available, I want to switch over to that one. I have uninstalled it to voice my option and hopefully my Alberta government will see the drop-off installment of this app to take appropriate action.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 16:52:14__

> Huge drain on battery esp after first installing and after installing a recent update update. After first install it sorted itself out after about a week. Hope it does the same after this update (it is draining my battery completely after a few hours and normally I can go all day without dropping below 40 per cent). Great idea just needs to be optimized a bit more.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 06:33:13__

> Huuuge battery drainer.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 15:41:00__

> It has been a good app for now.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 05:20:33__

> It's irritating that it has a large notification on my screen all the time to note that it's running, rather than an icon, or the option to just run in the background without that. Worse, it drains my battery, using as much power as almost everything else I run combined. I'd like to use it, but this isn't feasible.<br> :date: __2020-08-27 01:11:47__

> Idea is great, but for many weeks I used this app whenever I went out, and nothing was happening. Wasn't sure what was going on, maybe I was just safe. Then I found out, that in fact, there was actually nothing going on, this app wasn't working, and did nothing for a long time after its release. For an app that some people trust with their lives, literally, it sure sucks.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 15:22:50__

> Ok not great<br> :date: __2020-11-19 22:23:04__

> This app SUCKS! It EATS your phones battery, is constantly running and even after you get home, there is no way to turn it off. In 3 hours my phone charge dropped from 98% to 56% with my phone just sitting there. The 3 hours before that, my phone used 2% battery power and that was with me using fb and other apps.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 22:43:38__

Unable to locate other users nearby after finally setting up. Will delete after this review. Need to use federal app instead of this one.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 21:15:00__

> Good concept, terrible execution: huge layout shifts and slow responses with no visual feedback on tap events make for a horrible user experience. It's hard to mess up buttons and forms this badly without some concentrated effort.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:10:55__

> Mine won't work away from computer<br> :date: __2020-11-10 17:19:45__

> Good idea. I've been using it for a while now. On the other hand it tells me I should self-isolate for fourteen days LITERALLY EVERY TIME I self-report - even after a month of "no symptoms". The worst I've ever reported is a mild headache. I don't get it.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 17:55:23__

> Stupid app wont let me send the daily check in results<br> :date: __2020-10-08 08:32:50__

> This is not a be all end all app. It has good information. After you submit your symptoms, you lose the bottom menu (Home, Stats, etc). You have to back out to get to this menu. Not easy to exit the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 21:44:01__

> For such a simple app, it sure is slow. You tap an option (such as the check-in option) and you wait 5 seconds before anything happens with no indication that your tap actually registered. And it's not like the next screen has anything complicated that it needs to be "loading" either. It's just text. So what's up?<br> :date: __2020-10-05 20:06:20__

> It doesn't ask every day to check in like it used to. And it seems to be easily triggered to suggest isolating at almost any symptom. Also, when it asked if I had been tested, or said to isolate even though I was asymptomatic. A few days later the test came back negative. If I had followed the recommendations it gave I'd be home most of the time and constantly being tested. Good idea, poorly executed. I like the media releases though. That's it's saving grace.<br> :date: __2020-09-29 14:38:34__

> This app tells me every single day with that day's date to self-isolate for 14 days, even though I'm entering NO SYMPTOMS.<br> :date: __2020-09-26 21:18:16__

> Meh. Not great, maybe of some use to somebody. I had expected more functionality with integrations.<br> :date: __2020-08-01 04:55:14__

> Pretty dissapointed to find out it didn't include any sort of contact tracing information system, but it's a convenient way to stay informed of COVID-19 nonetheless.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 18:11:40__

> [Original Rel review] Unreliable notifications. No app exit stratagy, that's very poor design. Otherwise fine app but becoming very slow to load or change tabs. [2020-10-21 Rel] Still no proper way to exit app. Extremely slow response throughout, even on fiber internet. [2020-10-27 Rel] Workflow error. After submitting daily check-in returning to home tab app thinks daily check-in not done. Exit and reload app check-in noted correctly. Other faults remain.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 15:11:04__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-08-11 04:03:41__

> Pretty useless for the user The app is nothing but a questionnaire that might help Health Canada from volunteer self evaluators, but shows no live data of infection risk around me like the Arogya Setu App from India. Privacy superceded public health.<br> :date: __2020-08-06 05:42:16__

> Why does it need access to photos?<br> :date: __2020-08-01 11:55:35__

> Relies on self report instead of anonymized health unit data - very limited usefulness.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 20:33:48__

> A good start, decent app. Could benefit from adding contact tracing, scientific information, better stats and province-specific information... Make it truly a NATIONAL app to organize the response!<br> :date: __2020-07-30 02:06:55__

> Very disappointed. No Bluetooth integration. Kind of a fail, not completely but close.<br> :date: __2020-07-24 18:07:44__

It is so slow, and I mean slow that you don't know if it has sensed my touch selection or not so you tap again and again!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> Together, let’s slow the spread of COVID-19. Canada's COVID Alert app notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive.
<br>COVID Alert uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones. It does not use or access any location data. COVID Alert works by determining how far away other phones are by the strength of their Bluetooth signal. 
<br>Several times a day, COVID Alert checks a list of codes from people who tell the app they tested positive. You’ll get a notification if a code you received matches one of the positive codes.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you’ll receive a one-time key with your diagnosis to enter into COVID Alert. The app asks permission to share your random codes from the last 14 days with a central server.
<br>Other phones using COVID Alert check the central server periodically throughout the day. If they recorded any codes that match the codes in the central server, their user will be notified that they were exposed.
<br>COVID Alert has no way of knowing:
<br>-your location - COVID Alert does not use GPS or location services
<br>-your name or address
<br>-the place or time you were near someone
<br>-if you're currently near someone who was previously diagnosed
<br>Provincial and territorial governments are working to support COVID Alert across Canada. In some places, people cannot yet report a COVID-19 diagnosis through this app.
<br>It’s still helpful to keep COVID Alert on, no matter where you are.  That way, when people are able to report a diagnosis, you’ll find out if you were near them.
<br>COVID Alert was built by Health Canada with the Canadian Digital Service on the private exposure notification framework by Apple and Google.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Health Canada | Santé Canada |
| **Website**  | [https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/help.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/help.html) |
| **Email** | hc.AlerteCOVIDAlert.sc@canada.ca |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Health+Canada+%7C+Sant%C3%A9+Canada) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. 
 **android.permission<br>GET_TASKS** | Deprecated | This constant was deprecated in API level 21. No longer enforced. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | Normal | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-08 16:20:15__

> 5 stars just to boost app. even if its not perfect, or the most ideal, its the best we have. improvements will come as time goes by. this is a horrable situation our country has been thrust into, we all need to do our part to help. get the app, its not a step in the wrong direction.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 15:32:27__

> Have not received an alert yet Very good news<br> :date: __2021-01-07 20:12:13__

> I think it is very useful App but I still don't know if it works or not. It would be nice to show a log of proximity check. This way user will know if this apps works.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:36:26__

> I have to leave a new review. The app is fine. The problem is that not many people are using it. There are only just over 3,000 registered with keys. That's nothing when we are seeing over 2,000 cases DAILY. How are we expected to have any faith in being alerted if too few are brave enough to register their key. This is not the fault of the creators of this app. :(<br> :date: __2021-01-07 01:57:55__

> خوب است<br> :date: __2021-01-06 12:15:45__

> Still waiting for support for British Columbia.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 06:42:06__

> Very easy to use and the developers have gone to noticable lengths to ensure privacy, like going out of their way to have any data pass through Google on Android, and making all the code in the app and on the server open for anyone to see, play with, and edit. making it impossible for then to hide malicious things in the code (code review prevents bad code from being submitted)<br> :date: __2021-01-02 00:13:12__

> Update 2021/Jan/01 The app now features a On/Off toggling button, which is a time saver. Thanks! .... It does what is supposed to do but it blocks other wearables to connect with my phone for something as trivial as syncing data after a workout forcing me to uninstall the app first. It would be great if it had a toggling feature with a timer so you can pause it instead of uninstalling/installing it.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 22:58:09__

> Does what it says and protects privacy.. I would however like the option to turn on of off the exposure check notification, I found that more of a peace of mind thing when I did see it.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 02:30:37__

> I'm glad to have it. But.. it is limited in its use as we can not put it on our older organizations iPhones which we have, numerous model 6. Requires higher iOS version than iPhone 6 supports<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:03:58__

> Update #2: The app finally appears to be working properly. Exposure checks are happening 3+ times per day, even without opening the app. Update: I spoke to soon. The showed exposure checks for a few days but stopped on the 28th. After I opened the app the logs showed a dozen or so checks in the last minute, but nothing since then. Is the app just not uploading IDs when it's closed or is it not sending out bluetooth beacons as well? Both situations aren't ideal but the latter is very worrying to me. EDIT: The problem I described below appears to have been fixed. I now see multiple checks per day, even without opening the app. I'm not convinced the app is checking for exposure and/or running in the background. The exposure log (settings->google->covid19->exposure checks) only shows checks after the app is opened. If I don't open the app for days or weeks and check the logs again, the most recent check lines up exactly with the last time the app was opened. I tried uninstalling-reinstalling and saw no change in behaviour. I've read that the app constantly checks for exposure as long as there is internet access but that doesn't seem to be happening on my device.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 03:24:20__

> Seems to work but the notification that is shown when it's searching for exposures should be disabled by default. With this on, it wakes up the screen and is just annoying. Just tell us if there is an actual exposure detected.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 23:31:24__

> Feel it gives me a good comfort level. Am 81 and appreciate any help to stay safe. Blessings.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 22:09:05__

> Finally app is doing constant exposure checks<br> :date: __2020-12-23 04:15:28__

> It could be very nice, but I am not sure that people testing covid positive really enter a code in the app unfortunately... I never got any alert... I understand how it works but I doubt that there's a lot of people honest enough to enter their code in it for real. That's what I meant.. ;) Thanks!<br> :date: __2020-12-22 04:05:38__

> I like the idea of this, I hope this helps people be made more aware and can be safe in exposure from others. I shut mine off till I got outside, as I'm not around anyone when I'm at home. Am I supposed to keep this on, or just when I go out??<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:52:01__

> Operates in the background, nothing to do, I see checks have happened but no exposures and no personally identifiable details. The more people download this the better.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 03:29:39__

> I know the app has some minor issues but no technology is perfect, so many thanks to all the hard working developers! My only suggestion is to have the date and time of exposure available to the users so contact tracing becomes easier.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 01:58:11__

Samsung S8 Android 9, Covid 1.1.2 - opening app seems to help Just updated to 1.1.3 - ability to turn off app - let's see if it fixes the checks issue - 19.12.20 - v 1.1.4 no checks since 16.12.20 - (03.01.21) no checks since 27.12.20 - updated to v1.1.5 - nothing happened - opened app and 11 checks occurred all at once - this app keeps you on your toes - getting close to 50..<br> :date: __2021-01-04 03:54:08__

> Do u have to keep your data on ??<br> :date: __2021-01-03 05:39:19__

> Just writing a review to report an issue. My phone stopped doing exposure checks 3 days ago (4 Jan 2021). Looks like that coincides with an update. I think something broke. Running on Android 8.0.0<br> :date: __2021-01-07 20:00:22__

> I see a comment from Dec 30th that the major flaw is that location settings need to be on. The response from the developer is that the user just needs to update the app. I just installed it (Jan 7th) and it is asking for location settings to be on. ...Not sure what the developer means, if I don't turn on the location, the app will not run.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:12:26__

> Great concept but the app is ineffective when Bluetooth or data is off? Why doesn't it have the option to manually enter where you were if it was turned off / battery died? Also, there should be a wider exposure range of reporting than within 6ft for at least 15 minutes.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 05:39:13__

> I dont like the fact that you have to keep your GPS location ON in order for it to be ENABLED!<br> :date: __2021-01-06 04:00:41__

> Usefulness most unclear in the absence of useful adoption&reporting stats in a given area. No social distancing capability either. Better to prevent than to cure? Not having been seriously ever field trialed explains a lot imho. No end in sight with these long overdue negotiations with BCH two weeks away from xmast holiday does not help. No new features release plan either??? Let's hope the vaccine works and we can get there. Revising to 2*s as CDS is actually revising app based on feedback.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 03:33:22__

> I was notified by a roommate who tested positive, I had been in contact with him for 10 days before he was notified, I thankfully tested negative but had been with him regularly. This app has no way to warn people about that. Nore did it warn me when he tested positive. He submitted a code in the app. My bluetooth is always on. I also work in an automotive industry and am in and out of customer vehicles. I'm high risk..... Should be linked to your health card, or other government issues ID.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 03:40:36__

> I am frustrating with that app doesn't have the vibration to alert me and warn me about those COVID-19 may be surrounded us. Please set up that vibrating with alert of flashing light. Thanks C.C.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 21:04:13__

> Continuously pops up an alert "COVID Alert" when just checking, creates a lot of anxiety.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 05:07:37__

> Seems to stop working without notice. I have to manually update the app when it does, but I'm never sure when it stops working so the tracking isn't reliable.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 12:17:25__

> Great idea, IF all Provences utilize them. But they don't so it's broken.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 18:32:43__

> The app allows me to do a daily health check but nothing else. Does not Alert me to any possible contact with infected people. It says it is not compatible with my device SM-T387W. Since this device is my cell phone/tablet the app is useless for me.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 22:47:19__

I stood within the 2 meters for 8 hours a day with my colleague who had the app and reported it through the app. Now another person has tested positive, 2 days ago, again close contact and STILL this app has not notified me.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Medic Mobile, Inc. |
| **Website**  | [http://medicmobile.org](http://medicmobile.org) |
| **Email** | support@medicmobile.org |
| **Physical address**  | [3254 19th Street, Floor Two San Francisco, CA 94110 USA](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3254%2019th%20Street,%20Floor%20Two%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%2094110%20USA) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Medic+Mobile,+Inc.) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

<br>Our intention had been to follow industry standards and move to a yearly subscription model for this new release, but we have decided to delay that change and instead make this app free to everyone for the next 3 months. We hope this will be of some small help during these difficult and unprecedented times.
<br>Bugs & Drugs is a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care practitioners.
<br>Bugs & Drugs provides clinicians with the latest recommendations for the appropriate use of antimicrobials and the optimal treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. It is also a key component of antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This reference can optimize patient outcomes and minimize the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, superinfections, resistance, and unnecessary treatment costs.
<br> 
<br>Bugs & Drugs is divided into six sections:
<br> 
<br>1. Antibiotics
<br>2. Treatment recommendations for infections in children and adults (including selected ophthalmic, fungal, and parasitic infections), 
<br>3. Recommendations for the prevention of infections,
<br>4. Treatment and prophylaxis of dental infections, 
<br>5. Infections in Pregnancy and 
<br>6. Microbiology
<br> 
<br>The Bugs & Drugs app is well suited for healthcare practitioners looking for an evidence-based mobile reference and provides therapeutic options in a clear, concise manner.
<br> 
<br>Once installed, you do not need internet access to use the content. Internet access is only required for initial installation of the app and to receive updates.
<br> 
<br>The content is prepared by Dr. Edith Blondel-Hill (Medical Microbiologist/Infectious Diseases Specialist, Kelowna General Hospital) and Ms. Susan Fryters (Antimicrobial Stewardship/Infectious Diseases Pharmacist, Alberta Health Services) with the help of over 40 reviewers with expertise in infectious diseases, infection prevention & control, microbiology, pharmacy, and Public Health.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Alberta Health Services |
| **Website**  | [http://bugsanddrugs.ca](http://bugsanddrugs.ca) |
| **Email** | bugsanddrugs@albertahealthservices.ca |
| **Physical address**  | [10101 Southport Rd SW Calgary Alberta T3A 5H4](https://www.google.com/maps/search/10101%20Southport%20Rd%20SW%20Calgary%20Alberta%20T3A%205H4) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Alberta+Health+Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Alberta+Health+Services) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> My wait time was an hour and a half, more than what I usually wait at a clinic so I don't see the wait time as a selling point. This is definitely convenient if you live in a rural area and during covid but if you can see a doctor in person conveniently you'll probably be more satisfied. The app layout is a little confusing, and when signing up they said that _ . , Count as special characters for your passwords, but I got errors trying to use those.

> I am sure the app itself is fine, but my first time using it, no apnts were available that day (@11am) but the nurse made an appnt for me first thing the next day 7:30am. She said that they would contact me just before my appointment with the doctor. I was logged in 10mins prior to appnt but nobody contacted me. I replied to the open/active chat/consult, but nobody replied. I assume because i had an active consult i could not request another. I ended up at a walk in clinic at 9am instead.<br> :date: __2020-07-31 17:04:30__

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
