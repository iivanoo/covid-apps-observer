## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app. Motivational and superbly constructed.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 10:40:58__

> I am nearly 70 and i thought my running days were over. I really was a couch potatoe, so this app is a real life saver. I am on week seven and run 3 days a week and cant wait to get up and do the next one. Some of the runs are a real killer but i feel so good when i've completed them successfully. This app got me started, and I'm not stopping.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 10:25:44__

> Delighted with the app as I'm now running and actually enjoying it ðŸ¤£<br> :date: __2021-06-20 21:48:01__

> Really helped me get going with running. Would recommend<br> :date: __2021-06-20 16:57:25__

> If you've ever wondered where to start getting more fit and active, look no further. This app is full of tips information and that all important support. Anyone can do it!<br> :date: __2021-06-20 13:00:29__

> For a completely non-sport person in her fifties this app has allowed me to train to run 5 k and run in a Park Run in 2019! I've become unfit again in 2020-21 and am starting again on couch to 5k - inspirational and easy to use! Non- judgemental, and you can do it by yourself or with a buddy- just need to start NOW!<br> :date: __2021-06-20 13:00:27__

> Excellent app. Gave me the motivation to leave that couch and keep running. Love the choice of personal trainer, Sanjeev is my favourite, just the right amount of encouragement .<br> :date: __2021-06-20 10:37:44__

> Great<br> :date: __2021-06-20 10:24:20__

> It works!!! I hated running on starting this app because I couldn't run! But I needed to change my exercise routine due to injury. Wow! It's hard work but just about to start W9R1. Couldn't be more proud of myself. I recommend to everyone. Download and good luck! You can do it ! Jo Whiley is my mentor and is the best. Knowing she started where I did really helped.<br> :date: __2021-06-20 09:05:01__

> Worked on me ðŸ¤· Also, tip, if the app keeps shutting down half way through, and turning app launch onto manual hasn't worked, you can go into settings- display and brightness- sleep. Set it to 'never' and your screen won't go black while you're running. That way the app is always open and doesn't shut down. It drains more battery than normal, because the display is always on, but I've still been able to get through the day on one charge.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 23:16:52__

> Didn't think I could do it but I'm so proud of myself<br> :date: __2021-06-18 08:25:11__

> Easy to use. Let's you play your own music. Love that you get to choose the coach. Good for complete beginners. Michael Johnson seems to have disappeared off the app.<br> :date: __2021-06-17 20:14:49__

> Really good to get you going if you're a bit of a couch potato. However I think the text could be less repetitive and for instance Sarah Millican could be allowed to add a bit more humour.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 21:20:15__

> Good app. Has a few glitches like not always lowering to music volume so you can hear the talking, but improving my fitness a lot with this program, it's motivating to see how much you progress.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 13:40:25__

> Really good and encouraging training app, but sometimes if you go off the app to change your music it doesn't record your run<br> :date: __2021-06-15 12:48:25__

> Good but need better motivators to spur you on<br> :date: __2021-06-14 20:07:31__

> Easy to follow app. Keeps you on track with your progress<br> :date: __2021-06-09 18:32:21__

> Amazed I ran at all, let alone for 30 mins. I actually pushed myself to a full 5k the week after which took 45 mins. Probably need to make clear to users that they probably won't do 5k in the 30 mins time goal unless they are very fast. Should be called Couch to 30 minutes run, really to be more realistic App can also cut out mid run which is very annoying when you are waiting for coach to tell you to slow down etc....Aside from that, it's really good. Thank you. I used Laura.<br> :date: __2021-06-09 07:33:00__

> Fantastic. App so well developed that it can make you into a runner in 9 weeks safely, without injury & making you realise you can become a runner. I have continued for one year having started the app in March 2020.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:59:50__

> Wish there was music included in the runs<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:27:25__

> This app would be great if it didn't keep cutting out several times during your run! I have to add a seperate timer to keep track of how long I'm running for which isn't ideal. The advice & encouragement is helpful though and it's great to realise your progression as the weeks add up.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 09:38:58__

> Was great but now keeps shutting down towards the end of my run<br> :date: __2021-06-06 17:15:17__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs. Finally completed the couch to 5k app, really helped me get fitness up<br> :date: __2021-06-02 21:33:32__

> Never thought I'd be running for these distances & times. Also never thought I'd enjoy running! App programme is excellent & having Michael Johnson egging me on helped haha. EDIT: lowered to 3 stars as you appear to have removed Michael Johnson.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:04:41__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:26:33__

> Keeps crashing every minute and a half so I can't use it at all.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 13:53:53__

> Works perfectly on an iPhone, pretty terrible on a Samsung galaxy.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 03:34:32__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> So far on week 3 going into 4 I feel more confidence on finishing each run. I am hopeful that the next few weeks will be as positive on both my mind and body.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 10:47:42__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Everytime I open the app, as soon as I click off it to start my music, the app stops working, goes back to the start screen, but carries on talking as though the app is running?! Tried everything to solve it ans having no luck. Anyone any idea how this can be rectified?!<br> :date: __2021-06-20 20:59:55__

> The app keeps closing mid session<br> :date: __2021-06-15 10:45:35__

> App stops working or times out, even when settings are changed. Not just me, it does it on my wifes phone too. Waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 21:19:59__

> Constantly stops without warning. Very frustrating app.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 14:51:43__

> Great if you only want to listen to music. But the second you play a podcast it pauses when you start your run. Zero options to change this.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 11:19:45__

> Doesn't save my runs and stays on first page so I can't see how I'm progressing through the run I.e what's coming up next ? Mins walk/ run<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:26:43__

> Awful app that is totally unreliable and continously cuts out whilst in use, rendering its existence totally pointless.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 13:10:33__

> Downloaded 3 times but app freezing at the "let's get started" page. To tech support to sort it out!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:49:04__
