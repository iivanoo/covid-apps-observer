## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | GoodSAM LTD |
| **Website**  | [http://www.goodsamapp.org/](http://www.goodsamapp.org/) |
| **Email** | info@goodsamapp.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Seems to work fine no issues<br> :date: __2021-02-26 21:44:53__

> Simple and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-02-26 19:23:53__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:11:58__

> Great app<br> :date: __2021-02-15 18:48:28__

> Upon installation, I can't seem to get past the initial introduction pages. The button at the bottom which says "Ask for permissions" does nothing when tapped. I've checked the permissions that the app has been granted in the application manager, and it has everything it needs. Phone is a Samsung J3 running Android 5.1.1. Update: Thanks to the team for updating this so quickly. All working perfectly now!<br> :date: __2021-02-03 10:32:29__

> Never leaves me alone. Works really well. Dare not sign on unless I've got a good bit of time to offer because I can easily get the next call before I've got home from the previous.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 18:54:23__

> Hi my app isn't working, I'm not getting any sound when simulating an alert and only just realised. I could of missed so many calls because of this it's not fair<br> :date: __2021-01-16 03:04:47__

> Edit: Thank you for clarifying and the quick response, that is working now! The app is not sending me notifications, I have been sent tasks but are missing them (even though I have been using my phone at the time the message is sent) because the app isn't sending my phone notifications. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times now and have checked notification and location permissions are allowed...<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:43:42__

> Excellent link to people who need support. Easy to manage App.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:15:05__

> Yay ! Now can change the alert sound, both I, my neighbour and my neighbour's dog are happy :-)<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:15:22__

> Since the update, this is a good app. I still haven't had a volunteering alert for the vaccination centres yet, here's hoping!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:01:46__

> Seems to run well. Had no alerts yet since registering<br> :date: __2021-02-26 05:17:37__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> The app works ok most of the time. One problem I get is the location side, I've had to reject quite a few alerts that have been 12 miles away even though my app is set at 5 miles.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:57:46__

> The App need an audible alert when scheduled tasks appear. I have missed opportunities to volunteer due to this. Steve. NHS/RVS Volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:16:50__

> The issue I had experienced has been resolved. Now, the app is up and running on my phone as it should. Thank you 👍<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:06:29__

> I just updated as there should be a new task tab for vaccination steward volunteers. I see nothing different<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:39:42__

> Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a "double ding" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the "accept" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the "bypass silent" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one "ding" now as expected - thnx!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:48:32__

> Update: issue now fixed with a distance slider on the 'me' tab, the app now works fine. ----- I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 18:50:43__

> Have not received actual work in months. Lots of alerts about people safeguarding but when called no action required. Also I'm supposed to be a driver but haven't seen a driver call since I initially registered.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:26:17__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:50:54__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2021-01-29 09:28:59__

> The app tells me my certificate/ID is out of date but when I log onto the website it states it's valid until next year. Please help!<br> :date: __2021-01-29 07:30:57__

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> Can the app not give basic details on the alert as hard to know if can adequately deal with the situation? Also I assume the alert goes to everyone locally until someone responds...I hope so as I didn't get sound on notification so no idea what time it came through?<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:50:50__

> This app work fine on my phone, but my husband cannot get it to work on his Galaxy Alpha. The screen displays 'please log in' but there is nowhere to do so, and you cannot exit from the app. He really wants to volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 11:00:36__

> I have just been cleared and invited to join. I have lost my password and unable to retrieve it. What should I do?<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:09:30__

> NHS have advised that app has been modified to allow selection of the distance you are willing to accept a task but I cannot find this feature. Also I don't have a "tasks" tab, still showing the "comms" tab. Edward<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:08:06__

> I don't know how to change my settings, as requested, and don't know how you would know my preferred distances (for being a steward at vaccination centres). Incidentally, I'd find it easier if messages referred to miles not kilometres, as that's what we use in this country!<br> :date: __2021-01-15 00:28:17__

> Keeps crashing.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:17:56__

> 1. I uninstalled the Goodsam app from my Android v10 tablet as the Task tab didn't show like on the smartphone. I was planning to reinstall to fix this bug. Now it says my tablet isn't compatible. WHY!!? It seems perverse to withdraw the tablet version. It was useful if my wife borrowed the phone. 2. I am signed up as a stewarding volunteer. It would help if you could add an alert when a task comes in. This could be the siren already in place. But as the "tasks" are less urgent an email would suffice.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 20:16:22__

> Buggy, clunky UI. Clicking on 'Show details' of a booked task closes the app every time. The details can only be seen by restarting the app. No way to go back to the homepage without clicking back through every page of the 'tasks' section. Can't copy text, eg task addresses. User unfriendly.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:22:40__

> Difficult to use efficiently<br> :date: __2021-01-29 10:37:31__

> I still haven't had a Volunteering alert for the Vaccination Centre in my area where I live, patiently waiting!<br> :date: __2021-03-02 15:26:33__

> Completely ineffective,I haven't had a single alert since I downloaded the app. No tasks have shown up either. I have logged out, uninstalled the app, reinstalled it and logged back in but still nothing. What is the point of volunteering if the app doesn't work properly. Really frustrated! GoodSAM LTD Thanks for your reply.I'm not asking you to generate an alert just for me, simply stating my experience.The one time when tasks appeared the app wouldn't allow me to accept so somethings not right<br> :date: __2021-02-27 00:44:01__

> Never had any notification since April 2020 to end Feb 2021. Hours clock up but not heard anything. Don't think it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:48:54__

> This app won't let me download at all I have a Samsung A20E.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 13:22:40__

> Wow, OK, so the developer response to reviews that calls out a forced square crop on the licence says "take a photo of your licence and the table it is sitting on, so you can crop a combination of the license and the background it to a square". See Richard M's review below as an example. Yet the photo of the AED allows for any size and shape crop. So the developers have figured out how to allow an any size crop for selecting one photo, but don't want to apply that to another? I'm betting that the reason I can't save my AED location is because the app doesn't just select a photo, it selects and forces a crop, and in cropping it, it probably loses the location data that is in the Exif information that I have confirmed is embedded in the original photo.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 07:00:49__

> Had so much Grief with this app. Had no alerts for so long is forgot it was installed. My circumstances changed so needed to edit what I was able to help with, app wouldn't allow this. Regrettably had to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 10:54:55__

> My brother's android go mobile "incompatible" with this software Guess that's the price of volunteering So that's one person wishing to volunteer but excluded from doing so by this gatekeeper..<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:22:38__

> The installation is clunky. If there's anything going to stop somewhere using an app, that'll be it. (I test and write software as a profession.) It's hard to scroll the page without hitting a selector (such as the country). The image crop allows only a square and could not set to the width of my driver's license, so part of the license was cut off. After several attemps of that, I was forced to select Work ID instead of Drivers License. And please fully capitalise countries' names! Edit: Thank you for your reply. I know how to use a camera. The image I was trying to use had the full driver's license - it was the cropping that did not allow me to use any more than 2/3 of the image that was previously taken by the camera. Edit 2: As noted, it can get into a state where a community responder cannot select 'drivetrs license. Was this app tested by devs?<br> :date: __2021-02-15 10:49:38__

> I'm a Nurse.Loved the theory behind this app.Unfortunately I've tried to install it twice tonight..no luck..im off to night shift now, I wont tell my staff to try to install, only bcause we are really smashed atm.good luck.good idea.just make it simpler for reallllllllllly tired aged care nurses.🌷🌷🌷🌷👍<br> :date: __2021-02-14 08:52:19__
