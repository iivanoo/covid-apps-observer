### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> My app is not working, it only show results of the DPI. I have called, emailed, deleted and re-installed the app and nothing works. Government needs the app to cross the checkpoint and its placing unnecessary stress on me as I fear I will not be able to go to work. My colleagues apps is working fine. It looks like I have excuses to go to work. Please help üôè<br> :date: __2021-04-10 12:44:25__

> Hi, Is there any rule that the details in the app doesn't get updated, if have recently travelled and stayed for less than 14 days in dubai?<br> :date: __2021-04-08 13:58:38__

> I can't register my App because even though it shows my correct name and UID number, it isn't recognizing my cell and says it's not the correct number on file. What "file"??? Of course you can't get anyone from Al Hosn to answer phone or return messages to help me with this change. So I am basically out of luck crossing the border until it's fixed. Ridiculous to just register with your cell number and not having the option for also registering with email, when cell numbers can change.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 14:37:26__
