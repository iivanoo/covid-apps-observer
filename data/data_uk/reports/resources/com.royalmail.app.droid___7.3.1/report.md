## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well<br> :date: __2021-04-13 13:13:45__

> Really good app. I used this app posted 4 parcels in different days. Once paid print out label, take it to post office or request collection , all done. After post office scanned can Track and trace online immediately . Simple , clear, easy to use . Thanks!<br> :date: __2021-04-12 08:55:23__

> So far so good, however,there should be a way to delete parcels once you've received them.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 12:47:22__

> I would like it if the app could save addresses that I frequently use.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 14:52:11__

> There is no option to delete tracking numbers on the tracking tab. The app need a feature where the user can delete individual or all track history!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 15:35:12__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-02-17 11:33:01__

> No matter how many updates this app has, it still doesn't work, crashes upon opening everytime. I have been unable to use the app since February 2020 on a Sony Xperia XA1. Sort it out Royal Mail. Update, 13 Feb 2021 decided to try this app again and installed it again, it now works, opens, can login, and view my saved tracking numbers. Let's see how long it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:14:54__

> OK..<br> :date: __2021-02-09 20:35:17__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-01 14:04:05__

> Improving thanks<br> :date: __2021-01-23 21:31:53__

> It's not a bad app for tracking parcels. Just would really like to be able to delete them from my list once they've been delivered. Any chance?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:25:38__

> World's be useful if it allowed you to delete previous tracked items<br> :date: __2021-01-12 10:14:01__

> Downloaded app to use the 'find a price' function, prices only works for the UK, easier to use the website<br> :date: __2021-04-17 16:49:49__

> Tracking Don't Work Properly<br> :date: __2021-04-14 17:05:34__

> Very unstable, crashes all the time.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 12:10:51__

> Pretty flaky and inconsistent in its current form, desperately needs a visual overhaul. But generally performs well.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 10:06:57__

> Had an instance where I'd booked a home collection and then wanted to cancel it. Using the info from their email confirmation it took me straight to the relevant part within the app, then nothing. Couldn't input anything and then couldn't find anything to do with collections within their help section. Postman will have to come anyway cos I can't cancel the collection. App works pretty well otherwise.<br> :date: __2021-04-08 18:36:43__

> It says there's an error try again at the end of redelivery after putting your details in<br> :date: __2021-03-30 10:25:00__

> Normally a fantastic app. But all it seems to be doing is crashing ATM<br> :date: __2021-03-23 09:03:44__

> Will not let me do change of address or any other services.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:46:46__

> Claims tubes that meet medium parcel dimensions are too big.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:00:00__

> Everytime I go on the app my session has expired and have to log in quite frustrating<br> :date: __2021-02-08 08:48:09__

> Tracking keeps stopping<br> :date: __2021-04-09 19:19:16__

> Awful<br> :date: __2021-04-05 21:24:51__

> login accepted on website but fails on app ... get this fixed please<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:18:16__

> Unfortunately when you book more than one pick up, the post man shows up and says he can only see one item for the day. This is useless. He refuses to take the extra parcels, which means I have to walk down to the customer service centre and drop them off. This is wrong in all honesty.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 18:45:09__

> This app is complicated and doesn't even include our local Delivery Office. You cant move your location without first having a post code for somewhere else. It claims that the local post office within our Coop is open until 10pm! It is helpful to confirm information you already have but not to find out anything new. I haven't tried sending a parcel via it, maybe it works well for that<br> :date: __2021-04-03 11:07:57__

> Navigation is poor, and it infuriates me that the developers blame the users' 'weak' internet connection for their own network failures. Funny how no other app or browser has a problem connecting.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 00:53:37__

> Used this app twice now to buy postage and both tines had to input info numerous times then when ptint your label at home constant error messages, it will allow me to pront a qr click and drop A4 label but that's not what I want so now I have to drive 10+ miles to the nearest mail drop office. I will be removing the RM option from my selling site.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:21:07__

> App won't open. comes up with a notification saying that it's unable to open and I'm left to tap either app info, close app or send feedback. If I tap send feedback it tells me my phone isn't connected to a data service. Seems a lot of hassle to report a problem ðŸ˜•<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:17:09__

> Useful to store your sending history, that's about it. No way to save my details or edit addresses, and I can't use card info saved to my phone when paying for postage. Even hermes can do better...<br> :date: __2021-03-11 02:21:32__

> So much room for improvement. I have to enter all my details every time I use the app, why can't it remember my name and address???? A list of favourite destination addresses would save loads of time as well. Tracking means where is it now, not we'll tell you after we have tried to deliver!! Also, why not attach the label to the email I receive to save me having to fiddle about downloading the label from the app before I can print it? Come on Royal Mail, a few teaks would make this a genuine alternative to your competitors.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 13:09:13__

> I am unable to login. It says my login details are wrong even after a password reset<br> :date: __2021-04-17 15:07:57__

> Paid for tracked Intldelivery-took 4 wks/promising5day.Except there was no tracking as soon as it left UK. I randomly googled post office in Ukraine finding the tracked history. Then realising the letter was attempted to be delivered at 1800 lol ðŸ˜†. what an inconveniet time to be at at home. Royal mail didn't have scooby doo of which postal office ukraine use, sowhy promise that whch you can't do. No wonder why other couriers have dominated market and nwyou're left on 3 ðŸŒŸ on playstore shambles<br> :date: __2021-04-16 15:54:08__

> I can not register because this app already chose that I am Mr, not Mrs and I can not change it in any way. I have modern smartphone, I am very disappointed<br> :date: __2021-04-16 14:27:57__

> Still the hardest company to complain to, compensation for lost item is disgusting, a first class stamp for a Â£20 item.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 08:45:14__

> Awful, would not recommend using<br> :date: __2021-04-15 14:05:08__

> The App keeps stopping.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 17:23:09__

> Despite being provided with a tracking number from the supplier, Royal Mail App says they haven't delivered it yet, and can't track it. What's the point of this tracker, to tell you they have delivered it? Keep up RM your fast becoming obsolete. Other superior companies are stealing your business, can't think why!<br> :date: __2021-04-14 07:49:47__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-04-13 11:42:05__

> Why is it that the sender has the tracking number which you've given them, but it's not showing at all in your system? "Unable to confirm tracking." No other data. Say something like, tracking given, awaiting parcel. Not Unable to confirm, which basically means no data/ that parcel doesn't exist for all intents and purposes on your systems.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 15:06:06__

> It tells me no more information than the txt and email did...4 hr window of delivery...I know.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:57:21__
