<br>•	Get proof of postage sent straight to your phone – get that extra peace of mind when dropping of at any of our locations (including our 24/7 Parcel Postboxes)
<br>• Postcode and address finder – if you’re not sure of a full address, or want to check a postcode, just enter part of the address and we’ll fill in the blanks

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> good overall but not all parcel statuses are updated after delivery<br> :date: __2021-05-07 01:08:47__

> little later than estimated but overall good service<br> :date: __2021-05-01 12:18:57__

> It's a useful app, it would be nice if you could sync it with a desktop version for easier copy and pasting if you have a lot of business delivery. However for consumers it's perfect.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 05:58:37__

> generally good, does most things you would want it to, my only complaint would be that it's annoying that it keeps logging itself out.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 01:15:54__

> On the whole a well tuned app.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:04:42__

> PayPal problem - PayPal used to work to buy postage on the app but now doesn't. Royal mail couldn't help me by email.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 18:37:34__

> doesn't save my sender information<br> :date: __2021-05-03 14:41:19__

> So the app is working well this time but unfortunately shows clearly that my tracked parcel was delivered to somewhere in Bexhill-on-Sea and not to us here in Wakefield Yorks.!!<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:06:51__

> generally easy to use, but some further options for streamlining would be helpful. linking in to click and drop account and previous collections from our address booked online would also be helpful.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 22:08:14__

> everytime I try to book a redelivery there is some error that stops the booking and some deliveries are not updated to say they have been delivered. some updates come after delivery stating your item has cleared customs and will update you when it will arrive. doesn't inspire confidence in the accuracy of the app<br> :date: __2021-04-29 15:28:35__

> It mostly works. Not sure why I need to skip the "take a look at your new app!" screen every other time I open it though.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 14:23:46__

> it works<br> :date: __2021-04-28 21:15:39__

> intermittent info<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:51:12__

> It asks the sender's address etc. from scratch instead of offering the default it has. Hopefully a work in progress - only half way there yet<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:40:25__

> Room for improvement - Handy app, saves time at the PO. 1 - When printing more than 1 postage label it sometimes re-generates the previous label for printing, you have to keep checking it's actually the correct label. 2 - Since this is an app used by 1 single individual or company I don't see the need to keep inputting sender's details, auto fill would be a better solution. 3 - Likewise save payment details. Alot of unnecessary repetitiveness inputs required.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 14:31:37__

> I have not recieved this package<br> :date: __2021-05-08 19:05:18__

> I am dis satisdied that I am unable to share my mail tracking on line or email anymore. i need to inform the recipient with the correct information. the app was easier before.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 16:48:47__

> Not impressed at all tracks your parcel when it's on it's way to but leaves you guessing when your parcel is being dropped off which is the most important bit . Royal mail should look at DPD app let's you see the complete journey of your parcel plus let's you know within 10 mins when it will arrive at its destination<br> :date: __2021-05-08 14:14:33__

> I paid extra for delivery and my parcel been sat in there depot for the last 4 days<br> :date: __2021-05-08 09:47:03__

> Don't always track<br> :date: __2021-05-08 09:29:56__

> item was delivered broken as it was thrown through my garden gate!! very bad service...you could at least deliver it to my local post office which is literally 50 metres away from my house.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 10:34:13__

> Ridiculous app. Royal Mail lost my parcel (an expensive phone) haven't been in touch. I've had to chase & the app doesn't even reflect this. What's the point in a tracking app that isn't updated?<br> :date: __2021-05-07 10:00:09__

> It's taken as long to down load and install as it has for them to delivery parcel. Still waiting. About time you give up RMail and stop parcel deliveries as your not really up to the task. Stick to letters that fit in letter boxes. As it seem everything else, others are better at it.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 16:00:42__

> recently I have posted a special delivery letter for home office for next day delivery. According to the app or website letter still not delivered, but actually recipient received the letter. There is something wrong somewhere.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 10:59:15__

> rubbish, will not let you change delivery and will not close properly<br> :date: __2021-05-06 10:10:40__
