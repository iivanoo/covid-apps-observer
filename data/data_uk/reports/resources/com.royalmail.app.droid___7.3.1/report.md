## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> app is a lot more reliable than the company<br> :date: __2021-04-22 08:24:19__

> Gives you updates on parcels if you know the tracking number but if it delivered you are unable to delete it from the list, so the list gets longer and there is no need for them once you have received the item<br> :date: __2021-04-21 19:46:52__

> it works<br> :date: __2021-04-28 21:15:39__

> intermittent info<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:51:12__

> It asks the sender's address etc. from scratch instead of offering the default it has. Hopefully a work in progress - only half way there yet<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:40:25__

> Room for improvement - Handy app, saves time at the PO. 1 - When printing more than 1 postage label it sometimes re-generates the previous label for printing, you have to keep checking it's actually the correct label. 2 - Since this is an app used by 1 single individual or company I don't see the need to keep inputting sender's details, auto fill would be a better solution. 3 - Likewise save payment details. Alot of unnecessary repetitiveness inputs required.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 14:31:37__

> annoying that I have to login every time...thank goodness for touch id<br> :date: __2021-04-27 12:05:44__

> was messaged to say they would deliver on Saturday morning, waited in all day to find it wasn't even in the county on Saturday, got another message Sunday afternoon to say it was now in the county and would be delivered Monday. was on 24hr tracked parcel and should have been signed for. found it outside the front door.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 13:36:35__

> problematic but eventually works<br> :date: __2021-04-25 14:33:37__

> last parcel got delivered to wrong post office took me 48 hours track my parcel down cost to me<br> :date: __2021-04-23 18:24:50__

> this version is quite buggy, but still does the job<br> :date: __2021-04-23 09:23:24__

> Great service! dropped stars for not saving my details in the app, having to search for my address etc is getting tedious. Also for not saving payment details for an instant purchase. With these it would be such a quick process. Please also add international postage, that would be amazing - I'd never use another service with all these ticked!<br> :date: __2021-04-22 14:07:51__

> saying have been delivery but can't find and no one knows we're is?<br> :date: __2021-04-28 20:19:32__

> WHY do I have to type all my details in every time I send an item?! It's just stupid that none of name, address, phone number, email & card number has an option to save and use as default next time. If that was possible, RM would be a serious competitor to parcel and post firms.... Although helpfully, the app does at least remember tracking numbers I've searched on previously<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:14:25__

> it's ok when it's synchronized with sender and tracking. I have a number of delivery notifications on here that tell me nothing but 'seller has despatched to royal mail'. meaning what? from whom?<br> :date: __2021-04-23 11:58:28__

> Not given tracking number then after being given one with today 9.30 to 1.30 it's changed and is now in a Wales that's Scotland England Wales and I live 8n England and woke up to being home after covid19 lockdown with no tracking again<br> :date: __2021-04-23 11:46:51__

> App Keeps Stopping.<br> :date: __2021-04-21 19:52:13__

> login accepted on website but fails on app ... get this fixed please<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:18:16__

> Unfortunately when you book more than one pick up, the post man shows up and says he can only see one item for the day. This is useless. He refuses to take the extra parcels, which means I have to walk down to the customer service centre and drop them off. This is wrong in all honesty.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 18:45:09__

> Doesn't properly support link opening from its own QR system and doesn't allow scanning of QR codes within the app, so it's effectively useless for attempting to organise redleivery.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 09:49:22__

> Woefully "designed" app. Taken all my details, so I knows who I am and all my details during sign up, then asks who I am and asks for my details again on app. WHATA THE SODDING POINT OF SIGNING UP FOR THEN???? Besides that, plain design and random implementation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:42:14__
