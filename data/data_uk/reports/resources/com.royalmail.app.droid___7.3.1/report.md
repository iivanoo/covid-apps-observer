## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> little later than estimated but overall good service<br> :date: __2021-05-01 12:18:57__

> It's a useful app, it would be nice if you could sync it with a desktop version for easier copy and pasting if you have a lot of business delivery. However for consumers it's perfect.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 05:58:37__

> generally good, does most things you would want it to, my only complaint would be that it's annoying that it keeps logging itself out.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 01:15:54__

> On the whole a well tuned app.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:04:42__

> So the app is working well this time but unfortunately shows clearly that my tracked parcel was delivered to somewhere in Bexhill-on-Sea and not to us here in Wakefield Yorks.!!<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:06:51__

> generally easy to use, but some further options for streamlining would be helpful. linking in to click and drop account and previous collections from our address booked online would also be helpful.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 22:08:14__

> everytime I try to book a redelivery there is some error that stops the booking and some deliveries are not updated to say they have been delivered. some updates come after delivery stating your item has cleared customs and will update you when it will arrive. doesn't inspire confidence in the accuracy of the app<br> :date: __2021-04-29 15:28:35__

> It mostly works. Not sure why I need to skip the "take a look at your new app!" screen every other time I open it though.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 14:23:46__

> it works<br> :date: __2021-04-28 21:15:39__

> intermittent info<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:51:12__

> It asks the sender's address etc. from scratch instead of offering the default it has. Hopefully a work in progress - only half way there yet<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:40:25__

> Room for improvement - Handy app, saves time at the PO. 1 - When printing more than 1 postage label it sometimes re-generates the previous label for printing, you have to keep checking it's actually the correct label. 2 - Since this is an app used by 1 single individual or company I don't see the need to keep inputting sender's details, auto fill would be a better solution. 3 - Likewise save payment details. Alot of unnecessary repetitiveness inputs required.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 14:31:37__

> annoying that I have to login every time...thank goodness for touch id<br> :date: __2021-04-27 12:05:44__

> was messaged to say they would deliver on Saturday morning, waited in all day to find it wasn't even in the county on Saturday, got another message Sunday afternoon to say it was now in the county and would be delivered Monday. was on 24hr tracked parcel and should have been signed for. found it outside the front door.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 13:36:35__

> don't get why you can't save contacts to send repeat parcels quickly, otherwise acceptable<br> :date: __2021-04-30 15:12:18__

> saying have been delivery but can't find and no one knows we're is?<br> :date: __2021-04-28 20:19:32__

> Not given tracking number then after being given one with today 9.30 to 1.30 it's changed and is now in a Wales that's Scotland England Wales and I live 8n England and woke up to being home after covid19 lockdown with no tracking again<br> :date: __2021-04-23 11:46:51__

> you need a password to get to biometrics. idiots.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:39:48__

> WHY do I have to type all my details in every time I send an item?! It's just stupid that none of name, address, phone number, email & card number has an option to save and use as default next time. Also, confirmation email doesn't contain a link to the postage label so you can print it easily! Aaargh. Although helpfully, the app does at least remember tracking numbers I've searched on previously<br> :date: __2021-05-01 13:46:19__

> Useless. Doesn't recognise the tracking number on the "something for you" note and won't allow scanning of the QR code<br> :date: __2021-05-01 12:37:32__

> Requested it to be delivered to neighbour however they told me I wasnt in....I know thats why I requested neighbour. So requested local post office, emailed me meridian, then random depot....just want my parcel<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:01:27__

> Delivered a to somebody else's address And now I've got to wait over 10 days before they can let me know if it's going to be delivered Meanwhile I'm without a car, not good<br> :date: __2021-05-01 10:00:19__

> the app doesnt have the same tracking info as the website does, disappointing<br> :date: __2021-05-01 07:33:17__

> Only occasionally does it concur with whether they have an item. Rare. It usually says we haven't got the item or we can't update until we try to deliver etc..The track and trace system just does not work.. Even when I have received an item if I put the tracking number in it to test even that, it still says sorry we haven't tried to deliver it yet!! Joke. It's just like a sandwich with nothing in it. What's the point? I cannot track anything. Get a grip Royal Mail. Numbers that cant be traced?!<br> :date: __2021-04-30 19:40:11__

> we have been waiting since the 16th April for our parcel to be delivered. it has been at the redditch depot Since then. we have had no response from royal mail even after several attempts. even promising to call us back. very very poor service<br> :date: __2021-04-30 19:37:18__

> terrible tracking app. missed delivery even though I was waiting in all day. I don't have transport so I have to walk to the sorting office. thanks<br> :date: __2021-04-30 19:19:09__

> Keeps stopping<br> :date: __2021-04-30 11:28:39__
