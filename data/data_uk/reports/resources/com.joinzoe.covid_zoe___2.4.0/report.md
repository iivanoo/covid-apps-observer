### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Is there any point in competing this anymore? The information on there hasn't been updated in months, and you haven't updated to include adding vaccination details.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 17:37:49__

> My app on Android will not allow me to add another person as it is for USA only<br> :date: __2021-04-07 08:29:39__

> I'm torn between providing data and potentially contributing to a casedemic<br> :date: __2021-04-06 23:18:28__

> Just wish they would add walk in community test centres to their locations options. Many towns now have them and we've had since before Christmas but i have to manually type in each time as the nearest other option is drive through.<br> :date: __2021-04-04 14:24:34__

> The year is not displayed when I enter dates, so I am not sure it gets the year correct. Whenever I edit the date, it defaults to 2021.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 17:52:30__

> Sometimes difficult to navigate. I would have stopped using, but I am a part of a long term health study.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 16:06:50__

> Suddenly asking me to login each time and now not recognizing my account aftrr reinstalling.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 17:53:00__

> Clunky, on a daily basis you need to update your profiles, yet they are only available by scrolling right to the bottom of the home screen, which you have to do again and again for EVERY profile, no thought put into how this is used daily.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 15:40:49__

> Diet insights are a waste of time. This insight would be valid if it reviewed my original diet, but the whole score is simply based on whether your diet has changed, not what it is. This lack of research makes you wonder about the rest of the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 10:08:01__

> Hello! DOES ANYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS APP CARE THAT THE APP DOESN'T RECORD MY DATA? YOU HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO ANY OF MY EMAILS. PLEASE reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 5 days. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 02:43:15__

> So many questions daily. It got tedious.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 01:42:12__

> Good for up to date info. I'm unable to log my vaccination, told to ensure I have latest updates etc. so even reinstalled app to ensure this, but still can't. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-03-10 12:56:37__

> I had a lateral test turns out to be positive and a lab test turns out negative, does this app help me what I need to do next NO. Use the lab tests use the track and trace app. More accurate.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 09:54:30__

> Cannot find where I put my daily health check in<br> :date: __2021-03-08 12:31:19__

> It seems to make up local cases numbers on the fly. My area hasn't seen more than 6900 cases since the start of the pandemic, yet apparently, according to the app we've had nearly 15k... Something's amiss here<br> :date: __2021-03-07 10:44:34__

> Has been great until today, then froze. Rebooted phone and 95 days of data lost. Including all inputs on jabs and dates.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:02:38__

> Poor. Connection Difficult always to log in .<br> :date: __2021-04-09 12:28:45__

> I had this app a while ago, uninstalled it but forgot to review it. Fairly poor interface but also I'd question the value of the data gathered and how it can be of real value.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 03:02:39__

> Apparently I'm supposed to be able to log my vaccine on here. Still have not worked out how. Can ask other people log their vaccine, but no idea how to log my own. Very frustrating. I've checked I've got the latest version, I'm pretty tech savvy but still no idea. Given up.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 08:49:24__

> 547 MB of storage used!? This should be such a simple little app!<br> :date: __2021-04-04 15:00:35__

> Still a blank white space where the graphs should be: there were no issues for a long time, then suddenly one day they vanished! All you see is the covid case figure, 'Dec-Mar' on the horizontal axis & 'Share the graph', nothing else: you can't share what you can't see. No explanation given. Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe a good while back, they acknowledged the problem...but nothing. It is a good app, but I do wish they would take the trouble to sort it out.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 11:56:57__

> Hasn't asked me for update for months. Not sure why it stopped giving me notifications. Using latest (android) version and notifications not blocked on phone<br> :date: __2021-03-28 13:42:39__

> Easy to use. Pleased to be able to help this study. Update March 21 It's lost about 3.5 months of my data. No advice yet on if I need to re-enter vaccine, tests, etc. so currently not logging anything. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 17:44:40__

> Now wont start<br> :date: __2021-03-23 18:19:01__

> Sadly, went pear-shaped during installation: created account, without username or details. Emailed developer; no response. Have uninstalled. 1 star for a good idea.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 15:46:51__

> only asks how you feel "today" and you can not say about retro-active days (like day after jab last week!) That makes it absolutely pointless for gathering essential data. Only had a dead arm feeling next day, like I was punched in arm.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 02:57:57__
