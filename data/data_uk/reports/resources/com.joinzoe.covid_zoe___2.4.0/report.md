### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

</p>

> Easy, simple, just remember sometime each day<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:16:16__

> Easy to use and not much of an imposition to keep it up to date. If it helps reduce the impact of the pandemic it must be worthwhile<br> :date: __2021-02-23 15:41:21__

> Zoe App asks all the relevant and appropriate questions in order to assist the trials and tracking of how we are doing on a daily basis and updating our health situation also on a daily basis including inviting you to have a Covid test and to report the result. The video updates are very good too. A very good app.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:45:25__

> Very easy to use and data helps track Covid 19<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:03:50__

> Helpful to other people to understand any side effects.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 11:54:34__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-23 10:18:46__

> Easy to use but sometimes reminds you to report even if you have already reported.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 08:57:05__

> Ok but you didn't ask for symptoms experienced from the first dose only from the second which I just had this morning. You also don't ask where geographically I received the vaccination or it's relationship to where I live which could give you important information about the relative ease of availability of vaccination related to where one lives; urban vs rural etc. Also you seem to think this is my wife's entry not mine????<br> :date: __2021-02-23 05:08:15__

> Initially it worked well . Then i could not log in,tried many things ,incl password reset,i did get support, but coulnt get it working . Some months later, trying again, i was asked to sign into microsoft email again,and hey presto it worked. I think i was just unlucky. No probs now. Sign up its probably the best tracker in the business! 22.2.2021 Second time failed to be able to report. I think the failure prob dates to the last upgrade. Making the app for me useless. Going to delete and reload<br> :date: __2021-02-22 21:03:49__

> Very quick and easy to use and I feel I am contributing<br> :date: __2021-02-22 14:45:39__



#### 3-star reviews

> It's not intuitive, sometimes confusing especially between what's the page for vaccine symptoms and daily health.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:48:09__

> Disappointed with wildly varying statistics creating a lack of trust in software<br> :date: __2021-02-21 11:46:37__

> Site sticks occasionally and leaves you hanging in the air. Doesn't offer a ' no change' tickbox.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:13:38__

> Its fine, but I would like to be able to specifically say about how I feel after the vaccine. I am feeling nauseous, but only because I had the vaccine earlier today, and I have had to say that on a section which I believe relates to Covid symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 18:11:49__

> Initially worked really well with a daily reminder to report but the reminder has stopped working since one of the updates. Otherwise it's really easy to use and has a lot of information on the study, symptoms, developments re vaccines that's useful and interesting.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 23:40:20__

> Nice and well developped Covid-19 tracker app. The exposure map in regard with the region is very useful, although it cannot be zoomed in too much and it's difficult to select adjacent regions. Update: Initial Area Map is not updated as it seems, giving false current estimates (for long). UK map displays totally different estimates per area and should be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 22:39:51__

> Didn't recognize my previous PW.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 20:22:51__

> Get, 'Something went wrong, please try again later' each time I try to complete medical questionnaire. UPDATE: Now working ok since update. Daily reminder to enter your health status is good. App lacks ability to state that you know you have had Covid, but haven't had a test. This must apply to tens of thousands who suffered at home or who's symptoms were very mild and where caught off other tested members of same household. If to provide valuable data, surly, this must be included.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 13:25:45__

> Was a bit confusing as I only down loaded app after my 1st vaccine,it would not let me go back to add that I also had a head ache and fuzzy head 20hours in so if others had the same experience your symtoms value may be incorrect or wrong<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:47:59__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 14:25:03__

> Well done<br> :date: __2021-02-15 11:52:26__

> Have started to notice the "cases in your area" function does not work anymore. Discrepancies between number of cases and chart details. This number also fluctuates up to 50% on some days.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:58:38__

> difficulty in navigation and screen has frozen several times when entering data.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:06:47__

> Difficult to work. Repeatedly back to first page. Does not accept what is entered.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 18:00:23__

> Can no longer see the prompt on the vaccine page<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:19:35__

> It stopped working, button stays grayed on screen display vaccine dosage information when one dose recorded and no change, can't hit enter.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:35:06__

> Didn't seem to have an option for being pregnant. I think a lot of my symptoms can be down to pregnancy...<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:14:43__

> I am able to report me and my family's condition regularly. However, the app crashes everytime I select the COVID & Diet "Let's go" button. It also crashes before I can send feedback.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:46:23__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing. Have you even seen this? Why don't you respond to my numerous contacts about this? I entered yesterday. The app says 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:17:00__

> The map makes less sense since they started using cases per million when everywhere else does it per100,000. It also appears data for Wales is at least a fortnight behind.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 01:08:37__

> Useless since its upgrade have tried to uninstal, reinstalling, forgotten password reset it refuses to work. I will remove it and not bother anymore.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 09:48:35__

> Wouldn't let me register as I don't know my blood group. Totally useless<br> :date: __2021-02-20 14:13:52__

> Pointless, local infection rates reported fluctuate by hundreds day to day. Basically they have no idea what's going on. Not going to bother any more.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 13:53:32__

> Doesn't appear to work. It asks you to report symptoms even if well but the 2 drop down questions are both not applicable and you cannot proceed further. Also, I thought the app wanted you to report if you'd had vaccine and side effects but only option is to share that you've had it on social media? What's the point?<br> :date: __2021-02-16 20:58:48__

> Doesn't work!!<br> :date: __2021-02-15 18:46:32__

> Cant update, to put in my 2 vaccines. It just says 'pending' ans the the circle goes round and nothing happens.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 11:58:45__

> Cant download. Stuck on pending with a rotating circle that goes on forever.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 01:33:25__

> would like to record daily but the app goes to page have you had a test, which I recorded on the first day but dioes not let me go past it. anyone have any ideas which may help<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:19:11__

> The app is making a massive contribution to the fight against Covid-19, and on a day-to-day basis it works fine. The downside is that it breaks when it's updated. After the last three updates I've either been unable to login (despite getting a password reset), or the daily notifications have stopped. In all cases the only fix was to uninstall the updated app and reinstall from scratch. The update process needs more testing before new versions are released otherwise users will give up.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 15:06:18__

> I can't report my vaccination on my profile !<br> :date: __2021-02-07 10:12:31__
