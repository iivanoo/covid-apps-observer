### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
