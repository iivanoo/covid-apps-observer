## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is really useful in telling users their health with just a few simple questions. Also useful for monitoring over a period of time.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 21:06:36__

> it's just a bit of a pain how they keep asking for me to update my covid jab record when I've already done it (4 times to-date)<br> :date: __2021-06-25 09:41:45__

> Better than others I've tried<br> :date: __2021-06-21 19:18:18__

> Had an issue beforehand regarding logging in but customer service was excellent and can now use the app. Wish I could have access to more of my records like test results but I'm happy overall x<br> :date: __2021-06-11 12:18:04__

> App is now working again. And I'm happy again.üòÅ But apprehensive...<br> :date: __2021-05-14 13:26:14__

> This app is 10 times better than Patient Access. It's very interactive and keeps the user up to date in many areas like health and well being, including your rights as a patient to having access to your records.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 09:35:47__

> not fully user friendly, it's not obvious how to get things done, needs some getting used to to navigate. otherwise works very well.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:01:56__

> Works well. Limited functionality - presumably due to government and surgery constraints<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:06:27__

> bit slow today - edit: It is thankfully back up to speed today, though it means I'm unable to make a physical recording of it.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 10:40:38__

> Had problems logging in, but Evergreen helped solve that problem. Thanks guys!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:56:40__

> not optimised for android accessible settings<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:29:39__

> Unimpressive<br> :date: __2021-06-09 10:11:22__

> Been working great until today and now won't take password to log in<br> :date: __2021-05-28 21:04:14__

> Can be glitchy. Biometric login often doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 15:06:02__

> Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery. Lots can be improved and would be happy to provide feedback if the product team want to contact me.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 11:01:12__

> Bug fixes required - keeps crashing every time I request a prescription and cannot afford for the requests to not go through. Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 09:44:00__

> can be temperamental<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:01:26__

> my GP service is not fully functional but good for repeat prescriptions<br> :date: __2021-04-22 08:02:42__

> hard to log in with biometrics<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:41:35__

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

> I liked this app. I've been using it for a while with no problems but the latest updates have rendered it useless as I can't even login anymore. It doesn't recognise my credentials at all. It's been like this for a month or 2 now...<br> :date: __2021-07-06 14:50:44__

> Slow, Unrealiable<br> :date: __2021-06-18 11:44:19__

> Did like the app, but suddenly it doesn't work at all for the last month. Can't log in with either biometrics or password. So have to use the website. And the worst thing is I have had no response from the company at all.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 23:02:24__

> biometrics not working and keeps logging me out<br> :date: __2021-06-10 09:38:20__

> I can't get past the GP registration system i have entered my details correctly but it is saying, "There was a problem with your sign up. Check the information is correct and try again". I have tried 7 times to get past this and nothing . I'm fed up with it.<br> :date: __2021-06-07 14:21:51__

> I only use this app to order prescriptions. I can't book appointments through the app. Ordering prescriptions is quick and easy though.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 21:50:17__

> order page seems to change each time I use it. Consequently, sometimes I think I've ordered and I haven't.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 12:27:20__

> log on always a Faff<br> :date: __2021-02-28 14:57:25__

> Awful, only use it because I have to.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 17:26:45__

> The app no longer loads up, I used it to order repeat prescriptions now it won't do anything<br> :date: __2021-02-13 09:41:43__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="1_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.ascent.phr 1 reviews"/>
</p>

> Clunky and issues with passwords/refreshing. If the appointment you selected is taken, the system makes you confirm your password before you can attempt to book another. Causing you to miss out on other appointments. You always need to refresh twice before your results are actually updated. Aware these are just two functions but they are only ones I use. And being able to manage your health care is the point of the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 09:09:57__

> This used to work fine but now passwords don't work, thus making the app pointless.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 10:02:30__

> This is really helpful<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:22:00__

> Never remembers password have to reset every time<br> :date: __2021-06-29 09:02:52__

> Doesn't go past the loading screen<br> :date: __2021-06-21 17:26:15__

> It doesn't recognise the password anymore, even it just been reseted. And fingerprint scanner is not accepted. If is not solved quickly i will have to use another app. I have diabetes and i need to login often.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 14:23:41__

> GP service not working anymore after this update.<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:15:48__

> Frustrating and going round in circles. Being told my email is invalid (total nonsense) and being sent numbers to my mobile then means starting to register all over again. And uninstalling and installing again I met the same problems. The app is poorly designed and not fit for purpose and instead of saving my time has wasted it. I shall not bother again.login is a nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 17:36:26__

> keeps saying the user and password are incorrect. I change the password=>get access. Close app. Next time says the same thing=>change password again....in a loop.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:22:56__

> Not able to even sign up as freezes on biometrics page. Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 13:13:38__
