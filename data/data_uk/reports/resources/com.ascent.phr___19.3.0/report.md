## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is now working again. And I'm happy again.üòÅ But apprehensive...<br> :date: __2021-05-14 13:26:14__

> This app is 10 times better than Patient Access. It's very interactive and keeps the user up to date in many areas like health and well being, including your rights as a patient to having access to your records.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 09:35:47__

> not fully user friendly, it's not obvious how to get things done, needs some getting used to to navigate. otherwise works very well.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:01:56__

> Works well. Limited functionality - presumably due to government and surgery constraints<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:06:27__

> bit slow today - edit: It is thankfully back up to speed today, though it means I'm unable to make a physical recording of it.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 10:40:38__

> Had problems logging in, but Evergreen helped solve that problem. Thanks guys!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:56:40__

> I find the app easy to use and so far have not had any issues.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:59:39__

> works alright most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:03:58__

> Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:15:46__

> All good<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:24:23__

> Been working great until today and now won't take password to log in<br> :date: __2021-05-28 21:04:14__

> Can be glitchy. Biometric login often doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 15:06:02__

> Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery. Lots can be improved and would be happy to provide feedback if the product team want to contact me.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 11:01:12__

> Bug fixes required - keeps crashing every time I request a prescription and cannot afford for the requests to not go through. Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 09:44:00__

> can be temperamental<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:01:26__

> my GP service is not fully functional but good for repeat prescriptions<br> :date: __2021-04-22 08:02:42__

> hard to log in with biometrics<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:41:35__

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

> Wont let me get on to log in<br> :date: __2021-03-09 18:33:29__

> fairly easy to use but the app is a bit unstable - slow at times and some screens don't load on 1st or 2nd attempt<br> :date: __2021-03-05 21:46:12__

> order page seems to change each time I use it. Consequently, sometimes I think I've ordered and I haven't.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 12:27:20__

> log on always a Faff<br> :date: __2021-02-28 14:57:25__

> Awful, only use it because I have to.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 17:26:45__

> The app no longer loads up, I used it to order repeat prescriptions now it won't do anything<br> :date: __2021-02-13 09:41:43__

> Seems to not ever load the prescriptions section which was the main reason I got it.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 00:17:09__

> Not been able to order a prescription for the last 6 months using app. Was fine before that.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 13:02:32__

> login makes you go crazy and doesn't let you in<br> :date: __2021-01-22 13:09:48__

> ok App doesn't really do much in the way of looking at your medical records or being able to book appointments at the doctors etc. not really sure why I still have it installed tbh<br> :date: __2021-01-14 22:26:48__

> only for ordering prescription nothing else works<br> :date: __2021-01-05 20:39:32__

> Not able to even sign up as freezes on biometrics page. Ridiculous.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 13:13:38__

> Hardly ever works properly nowadays, all i want is to order a repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 10:31:12__

> Dreadful. It will let me in on laptop, but not on phone app. Wasted so much time. You could die waiting for the tech. What a dreadful state of affairs<br> :date: __2021-05-04 16:15:41__

> overly complicated, confusing where and what to tap, biometrics usually does not work. Utter cr*p<br> :date: __2021-04-22 11:35:52__

> Too buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:13:44__

> Terrible! I'm always having issues on this app with accessing my medication and ordering it. It has caused me so much stress and has very negative impact on my mental health!<br> :date: __2021-04-13 00:29:39__

> Biometrics constantly failing<br> :date: __2021-04-12 04:09:11__

> Does not work properly on my Samsung s21 I cannot access my medical record at all.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 01:04:29__

> Cannot get on the app, click forgotten password, get emailed code, enter code, and it asks security question, answer question and get message too many failed attempts, account temporarily suspended, come back a month later, and get same message on first security question answer, so just how long is your idea of temporary?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 20:15:59__
