### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-29 05:06:48__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-28 10:24:42__

> Registration wasn't completely straightforward but having jumped through all the necessary hoops (good to know the security is very high level) it all seems to work nicely and will save calls and maybe even visits to our surgery.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 08:48:42__

> Good app to view medication and appointments etc and to send message to your GP would be great if you could view up and coming hospital consultant appointments also<br> :date: __2021-01-27 14:01:14__

> It was quite a fiddly process to register but the app is very good and it saves me time when I need to order a repeat prescription or use eConsult.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 12:43:38__

> After an initial problem with my photograph, I used my Driving license and it worked fine 🙂<br> :date: __2021-01-23 15:25:13__

> After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. I blamed the app at first but it was the chemist who had moved to new premises. The app still works pretty well although i still have no access to my medical records. Overall I am happy<br> :date: __2021-01-23 07:10:51__

> Very good so far<br> :date: __2021-01-20 14:47:58__

> Overall I like the app but am unable to change my nominated Pharmacy or even see which one it is nominated.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 10:17:56__

> Usually have no issues. One or two problems have occurred but were sorted quickly. I use it to order repeat prescriptions. Have not used it for anything else. Edit: have also used it to make contact with my gp and asked questions. It's useful if it's not a serious issue that needs face to face appointments.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 02:08:09__

> Pretty poor really can't upload video to gain full access..Constantly tryed to gain access.. Waste of time... U installed<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:41:33__

> The log in took over four hours to complete. It will not load on my laptop. Once everything is up loaded on to a smart phone. you log in to check perscriptions all you get is an error message. I still do not know if they have been ordered and they have just ran out, so now still have to ring to find out. the phone charges are now over forty pounds. A complete waste of time and money !!!!!!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-28 20:43:08__

> Trying to register won't accept password<br> :date: __2021-01-28 17:44:04__

> Tried to use, haven't got any photo ID and my GP doesn't use an online booking system anymore so can't verify ID<br> :date: __2021-01-27 15:18:49__

> Simple after failing registration delete the app, pick up a phone ,enter the code number your doctor has given you ,when answered follow any instructions, when you get a human tell them what you want, The address on a driving licence is not necessarly where you live ,it is where DVLA can contact you , my son has had 5 addresses this year (rentals) he does not change his driving licence every few months<br> :date: __2021-01-27 12:13:36__

> One big rubbish. Can't connect to GP. And even login 👎<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:41:12__

> how can you upload your test results you have had for a covid test from a test site you booked on nhs App know were to add you results 🤔<br> :date: __2021-01-26 16:34:11__

> My registration failed. You did not pass our checks because some of the details on your NHS record are not the same as the details on your photo I.D. This must be the postal address ,the surgery hold 2, my postal address of my house in manchester and my sons place in Southport, as I stay in Southport 95% of my time I registered at a local GP, the ID process seems unable to cope with this which is not exactly an unusual life choice for a pensioner , I have other apps that work fine<br> :date: __2021-01-26 15:48:23__
