### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions

<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It is a fantastic app. I was able to register within 5 min and all checks completed in 10 min. My local pharmacy stopped requesting my repeat prescription and asked to call the surgry and surgry just kept telling me I'm on repeat and call the pharmacy or download this app. Did it today and now I can manage my prescription and appointments.

> "we could not change your fingerprint setting". But every other app can.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 21:22:44__

> Too many screens, log in is not the easiest.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 17:09:57__

> Gps need to sign up to this then it will work<br> :date: __2021-01-06 09:27:43__

> I found the process of signing up easy, I'm now free to order repeat prescription as required, but when I tried to signed the wife up oh my how many times have I tried and failed just won't accept photo and video match up. Gave up now she won't let me try again<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:10:35__

> There one problem with trying register with this the photo ID proof has to be a driving licence or passport and for those that don't have one these it become difficult indeed.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 01:30:11__

> Useful app<br> :date: __2020-12-23 12:39:05__

> Followed advice & deleted 2 older apps to free up storage. Tried again. It is still in a "Pending" status. All my other apps work, the only one trying to update is NHS. It's NHS update Got a recommendation to upgrade the app but all you see is the "washing machine" going round, and round, and round..... still in a pending state and you cannot go back and use the previous version. Wanted to check a medical appointment but now can't. Does not look like this upgrade release has been fully tested!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:47:56__

> Needs more details Why I can't see my health records like blood test results or scan results or even what is the problem that I suffer Please put that in the App That's right of our rights as patients,<br> :date: __2020-12-18 12:33:42__

> I have not used it much yet don't know how good it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:40:41__

> Generally the app is very good but I've found one "flaw" and one bug Bug: If you try to re-enable fingerprint access, after it has apparently been turned off due to "a change" on my device, the app crashes as soon as I slide the "enable fingerprint" switch. Flaw: pressing the back button brings up the option to log out, rather than just take me back a screen as is more normal. Fix is to reinstall the app. Samsung S7 edge.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:53:09__

> Fed up with this app needing to be updated every few months and needing me to delete other apps to do it. I t annoys me that I then have to reinstall the other apps<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:29:29__

> Pretty poor really can't upload video to gain full access..<br> :date: __2021-01-10 14:22:22__

> Currently occupying unnecessary space on my phone. Doesn't seem to work. Keep getting error message / call 111. Cannot see my info or order a repeat prescription. When it worked albeit briefly, it was great. Used to be convenient and work so well now it's just disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 10:03:30__

> Slow to upload required pic and info<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:18:26__

> Can't get past photo upload<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:45:49__

> Not working on my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-31 01:25:35__

> The app crashes every time I try to see my full medical history. I've tried resetting the app and still having problems.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 14:57:31__

> The consultation form asks like 50 unrelevant questions before you can actually submit consultation form. This app was much better when I used it few months ago.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 21:48:56__

> Cannot find out how to order repeat prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-16 18:59:17__

> After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. The restoration of normal service was a pain in the ass & only possible by re registration on my chosen chemist's website. It seems to have begun, though its not confirmed. As an interim, prescriptions will be delivered to a chemist shop nearer my home. Why mess about like this!?? Is the app or NHS at fault?<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:29:00__

> Impossible to verify my identity. First it said they could not tag all the numbers on my driving licence.. rubbish, my high resolution camera on my phone is not only crystal clear but easier to read than the actual licence as you can zoom in + my phones screen is bigger than the licence. Next I tried my passport.. now they tell me my name and date of birth don't match. All they are clearly on my passport.. they have not changed since birth... I've been trying for hours to get this working 🤬<br> :date: __2021-01-16 12:27:27__

> Cannot get test results<br> :date: __2021-01-15 23:30:10__

> Successfully completed all the verification hoops, which included scanning my face and the app still wont let me in to even see my app settings until I have linked to a GP (which involves more verification and calling the GP - youd think they might be a bit busy right now) Why cant I get into the basic app with all my correct and verified credentials? Think I'm getting an idea of why the entire system creaks and have a feeling this might be why money doesnt get to the actual healthcare.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 09:43:19__

> Whoever you have a accepting or rejecting IDs are silly. I sent through my passport and a video twice, both times were done satisfactorily as per the guidelines. They've rejected them both times. Wasting everyone's time and money. Get that process fixed.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 07:41:06__

> Read first! I've been with my GP for 7 years. Asked years ago for online access, they declined because I didn't have a repeat prescription. Received a SMS today from GP telling me to download this app. I did, had to upload passport and video. Once verified, app asks you to link to your GP. That failed; I need a GP registration letter. App now useless as I can't use features which appeared before identity check. I shared passport details with third party, for app I can't use, feel cheated.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:23:35__

> Wont allow access unless updated wont update<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:20:33__

> Please fix the link to the camcorder so that I can register and order my prescriptions. Without that link the app is completely useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 16:28:34__

> Obviously from the same halfwits the brought us track and trace. Absolutely useless! Have tried at least ten times to login using videos and photographs of varying ID. Has failed for numerous reasons as the automatic recognition software is not up to the job. A disgrace, but totally in line with the sort of rubbish rushed out by this shambolic government. I hope this isn't the only way you have of accessing medicine or treatment.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 13:30:07__

> Waste of time. Every time I tried to upload a verification video it would not accept it. Removing immediately.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 13:08:19__

> Don't cover all that's a big problem<br> :date: __2021-01-12 20:16:43__
