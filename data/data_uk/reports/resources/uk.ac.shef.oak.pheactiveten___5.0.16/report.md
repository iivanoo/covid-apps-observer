<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good simple app, does exactly what it says. Excellent for counting steps and pace, its automatic, no setting up each time you walk, very useful. Would be handy if it had a route map but its free, so no complaints.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 12:21:40__

> I am finding this app very useful. It is keeping me on track. It makes me do a bit more each day and I find that I am in compition with myself, always trying to push myself harder.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 10:59:25__

> Fab app I thought I was good at getting my steps in only to realise they weren't healthy steps this app makes me walk at a good pace as I am eager to get my 30 min active ten<br> :date: __2021-05-05 21:52:33__

> I loved this app at first it's very useful as I have fibromyalgia an need to phase my exercise slowly. However the app stopped registering my brisk steps and i kept pushing harder to get those brisk mins in, the result was I pushed to hard, then it stopped working. At times I walk quickly and it doesn't register other times I walk slowly and it registers. This has been demotivating. If these issue were fixed it would be a great tool for me<br> :date: __2021-05-09 13:52:48__

> The app is great 👍<br> :date: __2021-05-09 09:25:08__

> Good incentive to keep active walking<br> :date: __2021-05-06 21:53:22__

> Very easy to use and a great indicator of brisk v strolling walking<br> :date: __2021-05-03 09:46:27__

> Useful to track walking activity which counts towards exercise targets<br> :date: __2021-05-01 18:23:41__

> This is a good app<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:37:10__

> Sometimes I walk fast and the tracker doesn't register it as brisk. I didn't realise the phone had to be on my person; not in a handbag.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 12:50:55__

> The first couple of minutes don't register however brisk you walk so it's best not to stop. Otherwise it's a good help to measuring your walks<br> :date: __2021-04-28 08:54:51__

> Simple and effective. Generally accurate on my brisk walks, but some long, slow walks with my wife show short brisk periods that I doubt happened. Not an issue though.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 09:50:06__

> Handy reminder especially the brisk challenges.easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 20:31:55__

> No baseline assessment to measure whst is "brisk" for me. Makes you feel good when you notch up a chunk of brisk minutes, motivating to make me reach the next 10.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 11:17:55__

> This app is quite good, but only for mapping your walks. It would be good if it included other activities such as gardening, going to the gym, swimming etc.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 18:00:27__

> Wish it would show the miles I have walked. I'm sure it used too. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-04-30 17:02:41__

> Not very accurate - when walking with someone else who uses the app, they have hugely different results! It's good for making you walk fast though<br> :date: __2021-04-25 17:59:26__

> Not sure how accurate the measurement of brisk walking is. But it certainly raises awareness.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 23:59:09__

> What is counted as brisk seems quite random. If I use it when I'm dancing, it will record 30 mins as brisk one day, then nothing the next even though I'm doing the same dances to the same tracks.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 22:35:47__

> Would be nice to have a step counter and distance built in<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:57:08__

> It started really well, and I would have scored higher, but for some reason over the past couple of weeks it is recording my car journeys too. ( And not showing up as brisk during this time😂) I've checked to see if there is anything I need to change in settings, but nothing. Shame asvi was really enjoying it, but can't rely on the data any more. So frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 15:07:55__

> stopped working, reinstalled twice, still not working, Have reinstall after a while. Working much better<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:44:45__

> Moved to anew and in all othe respects reliable huawei p30 Pro. Suddenly the app is highly erratic in what it deems is an active pace and is under recording the same. I know by timing myself I am walking at 130 steps per minute, the app recognises I'm walking but does not record these as brisk minutes in a cases. I suspect its recording brisk for less than half the actual brisk walked<br> :date: __2021-04-13 21:26:39__

> Stopped tracking. Worked well 1st week but now doesn't track my walking at all. Annoying as I walk for an hour and half each day and am interested in seeing how I'm doing<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:47:44__

> Generally good and has motivated me to get a faster pace and do that for me time. Some irritations, however. I would like to set a (much) higher target but 30 mins a day is the maximum. Also, totals seem very slow to update at times and you have to close the app and open again. E.g. Its Sunday and yet my Saturday walk was still not reflected in the weekly figurea until I shut the app. Updated, data for several days lost, so reducing rating to 2 stars.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 15:14:40__

> Doesn't work properly. Very inaccurate at times.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 15:50:00__

> I can't get the app to work, my data has disappeared and won't load back on. I have uninstalled and reinstalled after a few days but still nothing<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:13:15__

> Really good idea in theory but the measurement of brisk is not accurate in my opinion, which negates the whole idea of the app. Think I'd need to be practically sprinting for brisk to register.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 22:56:03__

> Not reliable, I do the same walk each week in the same time sometimes it records 100 brisk minutes other times like today 8 minutes<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:45:18__

> It just doesn't register much of my brisk walking. Seems completely random, some days all is fine, other days only about 10% registers.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 17:09:46__

> Frustrating. App regularly loses all records. This did not use to happen<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:41:19__

> My phone came with this app installed & I used it for years. Sadly it now requires me to enter a password for a samsung account which I don't have. My phone is quite old, & I imagine this is something which has come in since I got it. There seems to be no way through this, so I cannot use it any more & have lost my data. If not for this I would have given 4 stars. I found it very useful.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:39:53__

> Doesn't take into consideration somebody's starting fitness level or age. I went for a walk for 40 minutes in the snow came back sweating and out of breath. My doctor says that is a brisk walk and good for me the app size I did 5-minutes. I feel that you need to be jogging for it to say you're walking briskly. Not all bad it does tell you how long you've been walking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:04:25__

> Didn't find this app useful because what I felt was a brisk walk for me didn't register leaving me feeling disheartened. ☹️<br> :date: __2021-04-29 19:09:50__

> It has been working fine, then for the last month it has been awful! Not recording the correct time I'd been walking! Told me I'd walked one minute and I'd actually done 30 minutes!<br> :date: __2021-04-27 11:54:05__

> ever since new update in Feb the app cannot get my walking info or it says I'm missing data<br> :date: __2021-04-19 00:57:31__

> This was so simple, but now useless. It just stopped working; used to record approx. time walking and time spent brisk walking - now nothing! Latest version of Android, Pixel 3a<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:32:21__

> Infuriating. I walk briskly for 30mins and it clocks up two cups and a few minutes, a couple of hours later I open the app up prior to walking and its reset to 1 cup and 1 minute. This has happened every day since I downloaded it (3 days) Seemed to settle down but suddenly keeps trying to load and says "we don't seem to be able to access your data"<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:47:38__

> Another waste of time and space doesn't help at all<br> :date: __2021-04-05 01:16:21__

> This app used to be great but when I resumed this month after a break it simply doesn't work. Constantly trying to load data and never does. Downgraded from a 5 star review. Sort it please.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 09:46:06__

> Very hit and miss in the measurement of "brisk" walking, well basically random. Good idea but poorly developed.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 00:56:02__

> Not fit for purpose. Doesn't record anything.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 03:20:55__

> I loved this app when I first used it a couple of years ago but now it doesn't hold the data. It collects the day and by the next day it's gone.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 10:15:40__
