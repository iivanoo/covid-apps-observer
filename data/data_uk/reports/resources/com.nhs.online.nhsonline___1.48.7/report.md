### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations.

<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So easy to use Set up in 5 minutes and now have vaccine record<br> :date: __2021-05-12 19:58:36__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 14:59:27__

> From download to full access took around 5 minutes, and was pretty smooth. I want to be ready for when Covid vaccination status can be proved via this app (I need to travel for work purposes as soon as practicable).<br> :date: __2021-05-12 14:42:50__

> Simple and good speed of response even though I did not have me nhs number<br> :date: __2021-05-12 12:25:12__

> Very easy to use. Great app<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:41:40__

> Have registered no problem and have access. Can I use the same app to register my husband? We are elderly and only have one mobile phone<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:04:13__

> Easy to navigate. We'll thought out<br> :date: __2021-05-12 10:48:12__

> I found registering the App surprisingly easy - the security steps were a bit cumbersome but understandable and they worked perfectly. I was able to choose fingerprint login which I tested subsequently and I had no problems with that. I was immediately able to see all my GP records so I can now prove I'm fully vaccinated against Covid19. Hurrah! Well done NHS.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 10:53:51__

> I found it easy to install and register, except for the taking a photo. The app decided when to take the photo instead of the user, I think it should be the other way round as I had glasses on still reading instructions, whereas the comparisons picture for validation was my driving licence which does not have me wearing glasses. Overall it is early days, I think it is a good thing that the NHS shares the data it has with the patient, afterall it is the patients data, and it engenders trust.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 10:41:36__

> After getting full access from my GP, I found the records of my two Covid jabs. I'm not sure how could this app be used as a 'vaccine passport'. It's akward. On one page there's my name and DoB. Then I have to click on a link, where among few hundred other records the vaccination records can be found (without any personal details...). If I would like to use this app for travel, it also would be very useful if the number of my 'real' passport would be indicated somewhere.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 01:54:40__

> Works well for me . But so much hassle to add my husband by proxy access. Thanks to the reply👍I ve got this sorted. Thank you<br> :date: __2021-05-13 00:34:23__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-05-13 00:06:21__

> Good for access to records. Please make the Back button actually go back a page and not request exiting the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 18:58:28__

> Took 5 minutes to register. I found it easy. I think having my NHS number probably helped. I cannot see my vaccination status though. Is this because my GP practice is not allowing this information to be shown yet? - thanks for your response. I appreciate my GP practice controls what I can see. Everyone having to individually contact their GP practice to ask for access to their vaccination status, just seems a bit bonkers. Haven't they got enough to do? 🙄🤣<br> :date: __2021-05-12 13:18:05__

> Surprisingly useful and efficient, I'm glad this app was made. Currently I am having issues on Android where it doesn't load so hopefully that can be fixed soon<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:43:32__

> It took me a few minutes to set up as I also have the NHS Covid 19 app and seemed to be directed to that! However, I got there in the end and I think it's very good.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 10:30:16__

> This is a must if you are interested in your personal health and wellbeing. It gives you access to your medical record, allows you to book appointments and repeat prescriptions. It will soon offer a covid vaccine proof service. Forget those who are in denial. It works.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 20:12:58__

> I downloaded the app specifically for my vaccine status but can't find it.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:55:46__

> Still getting to know how good this app is, but so it's doing ok, hence the 3⭐ Hopefully it will be better once we have our vaccine status added, to help enable us to travel further than our back garden!!<br> :date: __2021-05-13 12:10:14__

> Cant get onto settings to change emails or phone numbers<br> :date: __2021-05-13 10:48:28__

> Rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-12 20:14:57__

> Unsure of the benefit. It's supposed to display my covid vaccination status but I can't see how to find that without displaying my entire medical record.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 19:07:26__

> Unable to log in, or access my records etc<br> :date: __2021-05-12 16:55:15__

> OK as far as it went! The app downloaded fine, took my information to install the app. The next step was to prove my identity to gain full access. I uploaded my drivers licence once and my passport three times. Dispite numerous attempts this was as far as I got. The face scanning did not work nor did the video. I had already seen the answer, but thank you. I managed to get further the following day by 1. not wearing glasses and 2. uploading a file previously made and not using the camera.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 16:41:13__

> Great for repeat prescriptions, but I can't access my records, see booked appointments or proof of my Covid vacinations.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 10:39:36__

> It's a bit clunky, and the registration process with flashing coloured lights is downright peculiar. Worst bit is that after telling me in the Android app I can use fingerprint or face login it turns out it doesn't support face login on Android and my Pixel 4 only does face login.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 09:25:22__

> Pretty good app but can't reorder my medication because they have put the date I last ordered them 3 months in advance<br> :date: __2021-05-11 22:31:50__

> Everything was fine until I was asked to allow the app access to files and media on my device. I did not tick this box and I then couldn't get to the camera to photograph my passport . Why do you need access to files??<br> :date: __2021-05-13 17:38:24__

> e-mail address, practice ID, access ID, password (= linkage key), user ID (= account ID), ODS code, another different linkage key, mobile phone number. Date of birth, postcode, NHS number. To find some of this I had to log in to an online account my GP uses, which has its own password, etc. Of course, this app requires its own password. I have received a text message with an "NHS login code." After all that, my GP provides no online access to my medical records.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:07:58__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-05-13 13:25:02__

> Very very basic and error messages on some features. Does not link into any useful features like booking appointments or ordering prescriptions. Organ donation section not working, error message. A disapointing app.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 09:45:47__

> Downloaded it to check me jabs we're on can't access my records haven't got online access for anything have to write to me doctors for permission for it<br> :date: __2021-05-12 21:05:53__

> Cannot access anything, no appointments, no prescription, no doctors records.. waste of time<br> :date: __2021-05-12 19:59:05__

> Set up but unable to use as just goes around in circles with error - email sent for support<br> :date: __2021-05-12 17:18:59__

> Can't register. It says enter your email to set up account. Then a password. It then says password not recognised. Well as I'm not registered it will say this<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:36:13__

> Outdated before release . It's 2021 not 1991.. about as good as overpriced contracts carried out by inexperienced developers winging a sales pitch get. Can't book local appointments as it doesn't integrate with system one which is used by our local NHS. You would expect a lot more including video conference with GPs and consultants etc. Sending messages to GP, ability to download your record.. It's basically basic considering how much the developers were paid.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 11:04:13__

> Dificult to install and manage. Does not appear in my apps, have to go to app store every time I want to use it. Not recommended. Another half baked government project<br> :date: __2021-05-12 09:47:07__

> AVOID! CAK ON STILTS! AUTOMATED REPLIES THAT DO NOT DEAL WITH ISSUE!! APP REQUIRES REPEATED PROOF OF YOUR IDENTITY AND ITS NOT UNTIL THE FINAL STAGE CUSTOMERS ARE TOLD THAT IT REQUIRES A PHOTO ID OR 3 NUMBERS (NONE OF WHICH MEAN ANYTHING TO AN ORDINARY MORTAL LIKE ME) FATALLY FLAWED.
