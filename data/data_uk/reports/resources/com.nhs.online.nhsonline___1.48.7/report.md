### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I, however am still waiting 3 days on and the message on my login page says "we have not checked your i.d yet". We both have access on line to our GP records etc so I really don't know what the hold up is. Its saying on the website verification is approx 3 hours.Friday 7th May.....got a text message to say all my identification checks had been successful. Hurray!<br> :date: __2021-05-07 18:39:47__

> Useful for info<br> :date: __2021-05-08 16:15:17__

> Very useful appointment and hospital referrals management options. Info on vaccinations not visible and medica l information not as well presented as some other apps eg MyGp and Airmid uk.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 13:07:01__

> It's an application that updates you about the NHS services and very easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 07:57:41__

> Easier to use and better looking than Patient Access. I'd like more functions to be enabled.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 12:00:31__

> A solid app. I was easily able to get verified, book appointments, go through 111 and get all the information I needed. There is some minor usability improvements that could be made, but overall I would recommend this app.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 13:15:15__

> Easy to use, user friendly. Be nice to know if/when a QR code can be included for confirming 2x Covid injections.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 16:40:35__

> Do we know when the covid passport will be added<br> :date: __2021-05-02 21:09:04__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 17:35:02__

> Was able to sign up easily as already using patient access app so pre cleared on certain information made sign up easy....... Was working now not linking to GP it says manually entered info goes round in circle<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:05:57__

> I want to use my wife's smartphone ( my own smartphone does not have sufficient capacity ) . How can we both use the same phone ? Geoff<br> :date: __2021-05-08 12:43:19__

> GP does not respond to messages<br> :date: __2021-05-05 17:18:02__

> Installed fine last week and could view my vaccination record. Today I got the info from my GP to link to the surgery. Now everything I try to look at says there is a problem! Coincidence?<br> :date: __2021-05-04 18:41:50__

> Absolutely ridiculous app. I spent hours taking photographs of IDs and recording videos. All to no avail. None of my attempts passed the over stringent tests. Im sure it would be easier to get into the White House than to access this website. My stress levels are sky high after all the trouble I went to, and the NHS is supposed to be all about keeping you healthy. It's a joke. (Revised) After improvements to the app, I find it easier now.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 16:44:08__

> Very mixed - Clunky user interface and gives intermittent error messages in accessing data. Very useful despite its immature state of development<br> :date: __2021-05-04 10:11:13__

> Good for nothing.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 23:46:43__

> Cool<br> :date: __2021-05-02 17:15:19__

> Downloaded mine works perfectly brilliant in fact. Did my wife's but wouldn't connect to her surgery. They are telling me she has to fill out forms to be online with them which seems utter nonsense. Mine connected straight away to my surgery and I'm not electronically registered with them. What's going on?<br> :date: __2021-04-30 20:15:56__

> Seems great, but I have to complete access by photo ID, which I will do later. Got this for when the travel passport is in force, but how do we operate when my wife and I need this, and she does not have a mobile? How can we set this up so that we have both on the same app?<br> :date: __2021-04-30 13:28:08__

> Doesn't give you any resent test results I had rests 2 weeks ago and my records are saying no test results available going forward how is this going to work with the vaccine<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:38:47__

> Worked perfectly well and was very happy with it until I had to update. App simply won't update and is continually saying pending.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 17:08:16__

> Stuck on NHS logo on my Android device. Works well on my wife's Android device. If it has got installed on my device then it should show me the login page, shouldn't it?<br> :date: __2021-05-09 00:38:37__

> I only want to access my vaccine record. Takes ages to register on this & I still can't get proof of my two covid vaccinations.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 23:12:13__

> Unfortunately my GP surgery does not allow access to personal care summary so this app isn't any use to me and isn't going to help me if I want to travel anytime soon<br> :date: __2021-05-07 23:47:06__

> Logs me out, and forgets my username, every time I close the app, which seems to defeat the purpose of having an app in the first place. None of the other apps on my phone do this - not even the banking ones.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 23:33:48__

> Good luck linking this to your GP, I did everything correctly and got - sorry we are having technical difficulties, conclusion :- A lot of personal information entered for? What?<br> :date: __2021-05-07 08:59:43__

> Downloaded this app for the use for the covid passport but it says you need to ask your doctor surgery for your personal access<br> :date: __2021-05-06 10:42:50__

> I am still unable to get onto the site as NHS cannot match information. Ready to give up soon.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 22:51:14__

> Can't see the point, tells me less than airmid, and doesn't show Covid-19 vaccination, what is the point.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 20:47:30__

> Shame....as I installed and gave all details etc....and now it tells me not available in Wales<br> :date: __2021-05-04 14:29:44__

> I have spent an hour so far trying to log in. I've sent my passport photo at least 6 times, and done numerous videos with at least 4 different 4 digit numbers. I must have entered my e-mail and password dozens of times, and have now given up due to stress.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 16:02:51__

> Just installed this app and trying to open it but nothing happening . just NHS logo.al so how can I send a photo I. D when I don't have passports or drivers licence?<br> :date: __2021-05-09 15:40:53__

> Apparently I don't exist... even when supplying my CHI number.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 14:22:30__

> Will not load or takes that long it times out<br> :date: __2021-05-09 14:18:25__

> Just downloaded app. Despite being connected to my home wifi, app won't open; am sitting here watching the 'whirly wheel of doom' going round and round.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 10:47:38__

> Totally useless as the app refuses to allow a photo of a passport to be taken or uploaded. It just immediately drops back to the login screen with no explanation.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 10:20:17__

> Can you tell me why this app is only if you are registered to a English GP<br> :date: __2021-05-09 03:18:56__

> The beginning was easy. But everything sticked when it could not connect with GP practice. I tried to use another option using my details for online GP service i got few years ago, but did not work as well.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 22:20:33__

> Cannot see anything in this app. Just get a message stating I currently do not have online access to my health record, my partner has the same problem, which is odd as I know other patients from same surgery can see their vaccines, medication, etc. Seeing as we need this for covid passport for travel it's pretty useless<br> :date: __2021-05-08 20:22:00__

> Could not take a video so can't use it. Total waste of time. Emailed customer care but received no response<br> :date: __2021-05-08 17:35:46__
