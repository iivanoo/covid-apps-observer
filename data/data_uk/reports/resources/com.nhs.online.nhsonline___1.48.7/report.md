### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice

<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record

<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> No issues and quick<br> :date: __2021-07-04 13:53:36__

> No problem whatsoever and contains my covid vaccination certificate. So a unavoidable if you want to travel in the next year or so at least<br> :date: __2021-07-04 12:52:30__

> Registered easily asking the app to get my details from the GP, so did not need to provide photo ID... though my wife chose that option and had immediate access too, so both methods work. Ideal to access confirmation of COVID-19 vaccinations for travel, in case the NHS COVID pass letter does not come through we hope it will help with travel restrictions. The letter would be best giving translation, but better have a belt and braces approach in these uncertain times. Great to be able to write to the GP and order prescriptions etc.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 11:54:34__

> Easy to set up, and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-04 09:30:33__

> Be good iff I could access to it<br> :date: __2021-07-03 23:38:43__

> I'm here.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 19:32:56__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-07-03 15:38:34__

> Works well, easy to use, the photo and video validation also worked.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 09:45:36__

> It's very easy to install and use. Thanks, NHS!<br> :date: __2021-07-02 20:04:01__

> Installation, verification and setup completed under 10 minutes, free of any snags. All good!<br> :date: __2021-07-02 19:47:44__

> Complicated app<br> :date: __2021-07-04 11:35:54__

> Good and useful app Initially had huge problem with confirming my ID all good now and working fine Thank you<br> :date: __2021-07-03 22:23:56__

> Loaded first time without problem onto my samsung. It is a bit long winded in the way it works but it does work.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 19:04:23__

> All good so far and up and running. I was unable to record and upload the video for the ID check with the app on my mobile, so I had to do it on the website using my tablet. Hence the four-star review. Covid pass is now available on the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 11:57:48__

> The app has lost my vaccination pass. It was there a few days ago but not today.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 11:53:32__

> Installed and had Vaccine Passport in minutes.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 11:03:24__

> The reason I am leaving this review is to suggest that you recognise an NHS Number \*\*without\*\* the spaces: at the moment, if you enter the number as one long string of ten digits it is not recognised; if you then add the two spaces in the correct places it is recognised. I am sure this is a common mistake which is easily rectified by recognising the number with or without the spaces: I would strongly suggest you implement this change. Thank you!<br> :date: __2021-07-02 10:42:28__

> Worked fine for me first time (a few months ago) & I'm very happy but husband's won't link to GP. He's tried the fixes given by support, but it still won't link despite removing & installing the account and going through everything again. Husband has GP access via EMIS so we don't understand the issue. It suggests he has a previous login but if he does, we can't find it and have no clue how to remove it! Very frustrating as he's not sure if his EMIS vaccination pass will be accepted at events.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 23:39:32__

> No problems, once you have registered<br> :date: __2021-07-01 19:06:23__

> Gets the job done and shows my COVID vaccine status. Didn't face any bugs but the overall interface could be spruced up a bit. Otherwise great app<br> :date: __2021-07-01 14:17:41__

> Ok but won't add to home screen which is a nuisance.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 11:17:36__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-07-03 17:26:03__

> I installed this app on my phone, but I also want to install it on my computer. It says "installed" and doesn't allow me to put in any other device. How do I do this please<br> :date: __2021-07-03 10:26:03__

> My husband has got the app, but when I try to set it up all I get are my husband's details instead of mine. When I enter my password it says it's incorrect but it works if I enter my husband's password UPDATE Sorted it by using a different email address to my husband's<br> :date: __2021-07-02 17:09:57__

> Infuriating says no internet when I am beside my router<br> :date: __2021-07-01 19:10:44__

> I originally commented 'Not able to log on in Wales. Dose not work. Please reword front page to reflect this. This needs sorting.' The description does now read England not UK. But as I cannot use the app will give 3*. I am sure it does the job for England.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 09:08:04__

> Can't get any further than record your video, just won't let me do it. The instructions don't seem very clear. Non existent after Open Camcorder!!!. Looks like no holidAy abroad for me this year.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 22:33:08__

> If you are planning to travel using the vaccination status part of the app you will also find that you need a printed copy. When you do this via receipt of an email which gives you a link to the NHS to then print it off. But the printout does not print your full name, only your first name. It also says on the print "check against the bearer's identity". So you will fail the ID check as the names will not match. (See news reports about airlines refusing boarding due to mismatched documents).<br> :date: __2021-06-27 11:31:40__

> Ive tried to be able to prove I'm double vaccinated. I KNOW my details required are correct. I've tried not to growl at my phone, when I realised this app has issues. Computer said no! I'll now be using this review as my proof I tried! Stay Safe<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:19:39__

> The app won't access my camera despite it being given permission. Had to upload files instead.<br> :date: __2021-06-26 13:12:35__

> It's slow<br> :date: __2021-07-04 16:04:52__

> Always problem accessing<br> :date: __2021-07-04 14:47:39__

> It seems okay, but cannot prove my identity. When I take a photo of my passport I received an email saying it is blurred and all four edges cannot be seen. When I take a video, the video format of my phone is not supported (.p3u I think)... There should be a way to visit your GP and for them to prove your identity using a special code.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 13:54:19__

> Down loaded the app filled in all relevant information, however when trying to get to the apps features can't get past email address, slightly frustrating .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 18:35:46__

> Could be so much better Puts people off using it.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 11:54:59__

> Great app but the covid-19 pass only shows First Name and Surname, not middle names. Same on the 'Home' section of the app. This dispite the full name showing correct on NHS login profile and GP records. The name on the pass should match the full name on the passport for travelling. Tried calling 119 but they don't know how to help and can't find another way to contact support. Otherwise useful app.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 09:48:31__

> Nearly 2 weeks after 2nd covid jab and the covid pass is showing no records found. Following up to your reply.. My gp practice are telling me to contact yourselves as they have no access to the covid pass app.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 18:13:54__

> It completelly doesn't work to book an appoitment with gp or to repeat perscription so its useless during this times<br> :date: __2021-07-01 17:23:05__

> Does not connect to my gp I can not access all I require as they use system online which my mobile does not support.. Very Distressing for a vulnerable person<br> :date: __2021-07-01 13:34:16__

> Very slow to download<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:25:31__

> Dreadful app. My documentation was not sufficient for the app to prove my identity. Needed to upload video with me voicing a given number, whilst showing face. Would not work at all!! Ended up being successful giving non- photo id!!. Please improve.<br> :date: __2021-07-04 16:47:48__
