### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The NHS app is a great app, you can contact your GP to book apointments, see your covid pass, get health advice and it's easy to use. I give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 23:26:44__

> I mostly use this for managing and ordering my prescriptions, but it works very well and has no bloat or ads. You can manage your organ donation declaration, and you can find your NHS number easily if you can't remember it.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 19:02:54__

> Downloaded the app, as you would expect to get hold if sensitive data you have to answer a few questions take a photo of I'd then a scan of your face and boom 2 hours later I'm verified and can see my vaccination history with a barcode for travel.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 14:53:37__

> Process very smooth and quick.... Nice app ...<br> :date: __2021-07-10 13:15:46__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-07-10 12:40:56__

> Easy to set up and use. Great to have my vaccination status easily displayed on-screen. But most importantly, I've just been pinged today and altho it's a nuisance to have to self-isolate for a few days this is a minor inconvenience considering the reassurance that I now have knowing that I'll be protecting 2 very vulnerable adults that I would normally visit regularly.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 01:16:21__

> Downloaded this barely half an hour ago. Very straightforward to get fully set up with ID and a facescan, linked with my GP surgery with my records, and of course current Covid vaccine status. I am genuinely impressed!<br> :date: __2021-07-09 20:24:56__

> Very good first impression. I was able to order repeat prescriptions through the app, without having to speak to my GP unnecessarily. Also very helpful to get a greater insight into my health records.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 17:52:50__

> Easy to use,my proof of vaccine letter was here in no time<br> :date: __2021-07-09 16:21:01__

> To slow very laborious and complicated<br> :date: __2021-07-09 11:25:59__

> I find this app quite useful. My GP provides its own app for booking appointments and repeat prescriptions. Also I'm not able to use the repeat prescriptions on the NHS app. I think it would be a good idea if you had a way to show certificate status (hc2, hc3, prescription pre payment) via the app instead of having to show a physical letter.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 11:20:47__

> It took a while but I'm logged in now.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 16:14:40__

> Fixed a lot of issues. Can access my full medical history. Great app.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 13:14:43__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-07-09 11:37:24__

> It takes a bit of setting up, but it works and provides access to your UK NHS records.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 08:37:19__

> Easy to follow instructions and great information and advice<br> :date: __2021-07-08 06:51:22__

> Rubbish app, can't login after registration! Edit: This is now fixed for me!<br> :date: __2021-07-07 11:44:21__

> NO PHOTO ID REQUIRED Don't worry if you don't have photo ID, you can still use this app, contact your GP to get access codes, and follow the instructions, click on the underlined link above the choose which type of ID (I had the codes but couldn't find where to put them, thx to the app developer who pointed me in right direction)<br> :date: __2021-07-07 09:03:29__

> Ok but won't add to home screen which is a nuisance.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 19:19:18__

> Excellent Service...<br> :date: __2021-07-06 14:49:58__

> Decent and working app. But the covid pass barcode is not scanning with my fone or bar code scanner and just takes me to lots of gibberish numbers and letter. How can one prove the the bar code is authentic to any international authority while travelling internationally.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 23:05:16__

> I live in the Isle of Man. When will the NHS app show my vaccination record and Covid pass for overseas travel.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 14:54:59__

> Deleted 1st app download as it didn't ask for photo ID. Re installed and won't connect gp....please help!<br> :date: __2021-07-08 22:06:46__

> Was not able to prove my identity in order to use GP online services and access "Covid vaccine status". Each time the app returning me to login screen although I was already logged in and halfway through the above process. There must be a bug which needs to be sorted. Lucky registered now through alternative route. After entering those into app, the rest works as expected. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-07-08 20:45:30__

> The app is great but my Covid vaccine information is wrong.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 19:28:34__

> Was working fine for me then I got a new phone then added the app again and it is saying error all the time so then tried with another email but still saying error all the time . Please help me to get into my doctors reports as I need them. Cannot find any technical advise or phone numbers for help.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 14:28:16__

> The video confirmation part doesn't work - I've tried umpteen times to record this without success and the help suggestions are far from helpful [Edit 08/07/2021] I managed to get this to work via my laptop<br> :date: __2021-07-08 13:31:24__

> Have tried several times with photo ID with passport and driving licence but still unable to pass the checks<br> :date: __2021-07-07 22:02:56__

> it's useful at times but the app feels clunky and slow<br> :date: __2021-07-07 18:08:13__

> It's not possible to ID video verify on all phones. It was impossible to pass video verification on Huawei P30 and Samsung Tablet 580, but it worked as a breeze on Samsung S20 Note. I got the confirmation in a couple of hours. Now I can access my info from any phone.<br> :date: __2021-07-06 16:22:02__

> The app sends my security code to my wifes mobile not mine. It is not recognising my mobile number that I am using to install the app.Why. We have the same e mail. Is this the cause.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 17:15:01__

> Doesn't let me upload a negative LFT. When uploaded this to give site i would expect it to show. I have sent emails with screenshots. Today just constant error messages saying the app is having technical issues<br> :date: __2021-07-10 14:29:41__

> Can any of the people behind the app cast any light on this, please? I'm unable to load my Covid pass. Instead, I see the message "You do not have an NHS COVID Pass", despite having had both jabs and subsequently returning a positive PCR test, before finishing self isolating. N.b. I'm seeing the same message online as well as through the app, so seems like a back end issue. I can't find anywhere to direct this query, and would really appreciate some help in resolving - thank you 🤞<br> :date: __2021-07-09 21:51:48__

> Dear NHS I'm just getting whirly wheel or "there is a problem" when searching covid records. Is it because I'd just done a LFT and it was updating? Thanks<br> :date: __2021-07-09 12:21:35__

> Is it my patience or it's really difficult to access the apps?<br> :date: __2021-07-08 18:24:22__

> I installed it but now cant even find it<br> :date: __2021-07-08 14:33:45__

> Keeps saying can't connect with my Internet (when I've got download in excess of 100mps) and quoting an error code.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 10:08:29__

> I can normally work my way round app instructions, despite having silver hair but this app has frustrated me trying to operate the camcorder, it just doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 22:49:32__

> What a pain to install. Even after all the password stuff it still wanted me to record a video of me saying a number it gave me. Try as I may it wouldn't open my camera app so I got no further. I can't understand why my bank is happy with passwords but the NHS want password as well as a video of me. Typical government paid app that's over thought and over developed and trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Why can't you make do with passwords and texted verification code!<br> :date: __2021-07-07 20:12:01__

> I cannot get the app to download to my phones desktop. I already have the track and trace app on there which I do not want to lose.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 17:57:07__

> Very hit & miss this app. Works intermittently but most of the time a "Unfortunately, NHS App has stopped" Can only download covid vaccine results for travel only. Found out recently from the developers (end of June) that it works on Android v8 & above (not sure about Apple OS). My phone is Android 6 which I can't upgrade. If you want people to use this app then you will have to make sure all versions will run it. This goes to for the NHS COVID-19 app as well. What a waste of time<br> :date: __2021-07-11 11:45:08__

> Unable to open camcorder to record video of me saying number. ID picture was taken fine, so not a permissions issue. Edit: Tried on a different phone, app won't even open. Is this really the best the developers can do? Absolute disgrace given the money thrown at these things !!<br> :date: __2021-07-11 11:30:54__

> Downloaded with no problem, registered no problem.. Then get a message to say unable to use as needed an updated phone... Not going to to buy a new phone just to have this app, to show we have had our Covid injections when travelling.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:37:47__

> Its not eorking<br> :date: __2021-07-11 09:24:35__

> I can't even access this. Once installed and go onto the NHS screen all i get is a little spinning symbol. Unistalled then installed and still doing the same thing.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 06:47:56__

> Complete rubbish Time and time again I've had to delete and reinstall and everytime It keeps saying I've 3 accounts and to use the first ones login. I don't have 3 accounts and I'm desperately trying to prove my covid vaccine status as I'm traveling alot. I've had to get it in paper form now. I've contacted yourselves who then tried to say my doctors has to reset it which is absolutely rubbish but looking at the star rating of your app I'm now sure it's nothing to with my doctors.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 04:04:52__

> Mine got hacked 😕 . Just been contacted by NHS stating to contact them urgently.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 22:12:49__

> This app cant find my details ! Give up on this<br> :date: __2021-07-10 22:07:45__

> Not allow to access to my records and so some registration require a video recorder that doesn't work. Really bad application.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 21:13:01__

> Signing in and keeps losing your info or says doesn't recognise your I'd. Been for second jab today and my husband didn't have problems like me a woman<br> :date: __2021-07-10 20:58:04__
