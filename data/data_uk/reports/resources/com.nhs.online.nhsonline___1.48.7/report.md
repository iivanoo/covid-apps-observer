### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app to have on your phone<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:19:08__

> I had already created an NHS login via the web, logged in with that, added my NHS number, got the 6 digit number quickly and the whole process was smooth. Taken 10 mins max to install, see all my vaccinations and get my Covid pass. After reading all the bad reviews I was surprised and impressed.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:40:29__

> Great experience<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:38:53__

> Really easy to use. Does everything you could ask - appointments are listed, you can order prescriptions, get a COVID passport, get advice, it really is brilliant. Considering everything that it does, it's easy to navigate and clearly set out. Highly recommended.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:36:52__

> Dont know why everyone is hating on the app. Has everything I need and more and works perfectly.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:25:38__

> Very easy to setup. Useful for travel with the new vaccine passport<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:11:17__

> Seems clear and easy to use, but new to the app. No problems registering like other users have had, and no problems accessing records. The only minor issue I had was going through all the security steps before getting to the one where I needed to record my face, but wasn't in a place to do so. Making it clear at the start what is required would be useful.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 17:46:46__

> Good app and I like that it links to my docs.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 22:56:37__

> I love the app its got everything I need Just menu bar could be bigger 😀 thank you<br> :date: __2021-07-28 21:18:37__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-07-28 20:35:27__

> Could have better login features.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:10:58__

> I'm impressed with the way it worked and the information contained.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 21:53:58__

> Love the app but can you add a feature to see lab and test results? It would be a lot easier then calling the surgery every time I give blood. Thanks.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 22:13:28__

> Great service<br> :date: __2021-07-26 17:12:58__

> Seems to work well, Covid Vax pass is clear and simple (downloaded versions last 30days, in app version is unique code on each log in) Not 5 stars as I don't like the overuse of 3rd parties (I'm not signing up for ANOTHER service when I just went through signing up with NHS) and I found it difficult to figure exactly which NHS App I needed It is a fine app, I can see the negative reviewers need to read more carefully<br> :date: __2021-07-26 14:14:22__

> Great app for all your history. However can I recommend please if possible that a language selection as well can be added as when travelling abroad it would be useful to change the language to your native language<br> :date: __2021-07-25 19:00:23__

> Works well looks good but might be confusing to people looking to quickly search for treatment or a symptom checker. Great if you're good with technology but it's not for your nan<br> :date: __2021-07-24 05:19:46__

> Home icon does not work on every page but that might be something to do with my device. I use to have access to my full medical records & test results but that function disappeared when my surgery updated their software which was a complete disaster and in spite of repeated messages to the developers I never once received a reply. It would be useful if within the app one could request full medical records access as we all know calling a surgery can be a fruitless and frustrating experience.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 11:40:51__

> Not a lot of time to put number in<br> :date: __2021-07-23 09:49:58__

> So far so good. Setup was straight forward with email and phone verification codes. After that all my details came up along with my covid pass. It would be nice if the covid pass could stay permanently on a screen so it's easier to access each time you need to use it. But app is good and works well on my old Moto G6 phone.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 08:54:58__

> Useless, going to set up NHS login and got to my mobile phone, I have tried several times and still no text with the code I need to continue setup. Can't proceed any further. Update completed the registration process on PC and now works fine my best advice is do the registration process on PC before using the app. App isn't sending sms during registration process but does once completed elsewhere such as PC<br> :date: __2021-07-30 00:57:45__

> The app doesn't show my full name as such my middle name is missing and could potentially cause me problems at the airport if I use it to show my vaccination status. My passport shows my full name<br> :date: __2021-07-29 16:09:10__

> A bit of a pain but managed to get it set up after about a 1 1/2 of messing around. Seems to work ok for covid pass.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 18:07:07__

> Times out too quickly. Home button doesn't always work. Menu structure poor. Occasionally seems to freeze with nowhere to go.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 15:58:38__

> Although I reported a problem with the Covid pass feature a while ago the problem still persists. I wonder if being a twin is an issue for data input on NHS Digital . Only one twin has a working covid pass (Domestic & Travel QR codes) system...the other does not. Although the dates and covid status for both twins are the same. The NHS Digital app. support system seems to be a black hole.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 14:28:24__

> I've downloaded the NHS app and have used the QR scanner to check in places but i can't seem to get a covid pass, it says no records found but my Dr surgery says everything uploaded. Can you help please? Thank you.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 09:49:54__

> Updated review. If you get stuck at the video camcorder section while proving who you are then open the camera app yourself and record a quick video. Go back into the already opened nhs app, refresh recent files and click on the latest video. Then do a quick check to see if its ok before proceeding as asked. This is how i and others got around this. Once verified the app works fine for me. "NHS please add choice of camera or upload file at the video upload section" just like the passport part.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 06:51:11__

> I have downloaded the app on my phone which is fine as it goes. However, I wanted it on my computer so I could print relevant pages, I am unable to download it to my computer, even though the reports say I can, not sure why.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 18:17:59__

> Like with many others, camcorder doesn't open. It just opens the file list. It took me a while to understand I could simply record the video and then pick it up from the file list, and voilà! I suggest you add that option to the instructions in the app and also to the replies here (otherwise the process just goes round in endless loops and is incredibly frustrating). And no, the problem was not app permissions.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 20:40:07__

> Why doesn't this app remember my password like my other android apps do? I have a cryptic password for security but it's difficult to remember so having to type it in every time really discourages me from using the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 14:54:57__

> Took forever to get log in details from gp, Was expecting to be able to see medical records and existing diagnosis but there is nothing listed (I have multiple conditions) also have multiple active referrals but nothing shows seems anything prior to gp surgery switching to this service doesn't show!<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:41:20__

> I have been using the app a while now and it was great, however I just changed GP, and now the app will not let me order any prescription. My New GP texted asking me to link the NHS app to their surgery, but How can I do this?? There simply is nowhere in the app to do this? Very frustrated!<br> :date: __2021-07-30 00:57:05__

> I've just tried to download this NHS app onto my laptop. It does not seem to want to download. The system seems to know I have a download on my mobile phone and when I last used it. The scroll menu showing devices, shows the phone but not the laptop I am working on. Why is there this restriction?<br> :date: __2021-07-26 11:33:54__

> Downloaded app it will not open keeps buffering sorry about the star rating if its the phone<br> :date: __2021-07-25 12:44:11__

> Has geoblocking enabled, so you need to switch your country to install it<br> :date: __2021-07-25 11:40:53__

> Downloaded my covid passport, but it expires in 48hrs!! Why not the 30 days as promised? No help or guidance on why not working properly or what to do about it. Seems I'd be better off with a letter... when the gp has got the time to do that. I don't understand why people talk about uploading ID, etc... I wasn't even given the option for any of that. Why upload ID anyway? The app either knows it's me or it doesn't. Either give the passport, or not, but not this 2day nonsense.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 01:31:15__

> Cannot upload video it wont open the camera even after checking the permissions. And the previous answer about calling the gp for codes and numbers is bizarre have they tried to call a gp surgery lately??? Do you think receptionist has time to get all the information??<br> :date: __2021-07-24 18:42:12__

> Won't down<br> :date: __2021-07-24 16:23:01__

> Never sends the SMS that is required to log in, so its pretty useless. Messages came the next day.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 16:24:53__

> Poor<br> :date: __2021-07-23 08:36:27__

> Total joke of an app,when you try to register it logs you off at every stage. Got to the recording of me reading the four numbers and even though you can here them clearly the video doesn't show. No wonder Covid isn't under control when the IT is substandard. Got an email from app support,total nonsense. Sent me a link that allegedly gives me access to medical records on the NHS website... dead link. NHS IT department inept from top to bottom.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 16:17:16__

> What a useless app. Won't even let me register. Waste of E space<br> :date: __2021-07-30 15:48:23__

> I think before I handed over my personal details, email, name, DOB, phone number, you should of informed me that the App does not cover NHS Wales 😡<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:43:15__

> Can you please sort this out , its so basic! After entering my password, i get told ive been sent a six digit security code which i must enter, yet the code never gets sent. Frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:25:34__

> Just like thousands of others, I find ID verification impossible. I submitted a high quality passport scan, enabled access to microphone and camera, wasted hours. The only thing I ever get in response is a generic email titled "there was a problem with your ID" with completely useless advice in it. No help, no support, no option to talk to another human being, no alternative way to submit an ID and a video.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 12:36:01__

> Deceitful...ID card by stealth<br> :date: __2021-07-30 11:57:29__

> Terrible app couldn't even get signed in now it's being used a digital ID card in the form of a COVID passport. No thanks don't install this and if you have uninstall it!<br> :date: __2021-07-30 10:44:28__

> Vaccine passports for domestic use is an affront to civil liberties and I will neither use this app, nor show my papers to partake in the life that I have the freedom to live. I am not anti-vaccine (I took part in one of the vaccine trials last year and have been double jabbed). I am anti-creeping government authoritarianism. The more the pandemic recedes the more the government seem to want to use the last dregs of fear to radically change the country we live in. No.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 10:38:57__

> I can't log in because I live in Wales. Fantastic service. Well done people<br> :date: __2021-07-30 10:35:18__

> Another case study on how they squander tax payers money<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:30:19__
