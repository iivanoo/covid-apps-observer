### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellent development, really good progress,Well done to the developers<br> :date: __2021-04-29 00:58:13__

> Excellent simple to use with all relevant information available<br> :date: __2021-04-29 00:27:03__

> Read the reviews but didn't have any problems at all. Vaccination history goes all the way back to age 6 months. Not booked an appointment yet but all good so far.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 12:49:36__

> Fantastic app, I no longer need a microchip to prove that I've been vaccinated to go shopping or have a pint with my friends on a Friday night. A quick flash of this app and I am now accepted as part of the Covid elite who can access some form of normal life, for the time being.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 12:03:22__

> When all the security protocol has been completed, a bit of hassle, but necessary, the app works very well and is useful.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 10:59:14__

> Time Saver Been using for a while instead of the GP App. I just need my GP practice to get up to speed on access to my records. I will make a request and see what is available. It would be nice to know my periodic blood test results. Otherwise straightforward and easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 10:55:35__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:16:03__

> Got a dog bite (!) 111 aspect of app was v useful even providing google map link to the drop in centre I was directed to attend.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 20:49:26__

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-04-26 20:41:31__

> Good app, but I am unable to see my coronavirus vaccine record, is this the correct app to view this?<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:44:48__

> Installed easily ( Huwawei Android 9). Very convenient for repeat prescriptions Can't find vaccination records.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 09:12:15__

> Took about 45 minutes to set up, but finally did it. The problem was an old mobile phone number, which I needed to change, and I didn't quite understand the instructions. It holds the same information in the same format as Patient Access, which I usually use. I got this because I intend to travel in a couple of months and want to ensure that it shows my CV19 record.(Which is already shown in the GP Immunisation record anyway.) It'll be useful on the move.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 21:55:11__

> Does what it says.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 19:48:35__

> I love the app, on my phone, although, unlike some, I do not seem to have access to my covid jabs. I have tried looking, using my laptop, but it wont let me download the app. Can you advise, please<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:12:35__

> Does not link my child's account.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:12:56__

> Very good to<br> :date: __2021-04-27 21:58:24__

> Very clear and informative<br> :date: __2021-04-27 20:05:29__

> It's easier to have everything in one place like this<br> :date: __2021-04-27 10:55:45__

> This is a useful app for the routine stuff like booking appointments and getting repeat prescriptions. It would be far better if it also collected information about treatments in local hospitals, each of which seem to exist in their own data silo. Also, it would be really logical and useful to be able to contact my gp surgery using the messages function, rather than sending them an email that they ignore until I phone. Ten years ago this would have been a fantastic app.<br> :date: __2021-04-26 17:02:27__

> Doesn't give you any resent test results I had rests 2 weeks ago and my records are saying no test results available going forward how is this going to work with the vaccine<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:38:47__

> Edit to respond: no, pharmacy is not there, anywhere under Prescriptions. Unless it's hidden, but that's my point. And again, GP practice should be a priority, it's essential information, it should be obviously available from the front page. Leaving as 3* Review continued: Please fix the back button issue. Phone back button asks to log out, when obviously what I want is to go back a page whilst browsing the app. Please prioritise these fixes over Matt Hancock's personal Covid passport project.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:36:47__

> It's OK. My address is wrong on it. I registered with a new gp a year ago and it still shows my previous address despite being seen where I live now, at the doctors, local hospital and had Covid vaccinations. Unless I go physically into surgery I cannot alter this, they are busy enough at present without extra things like the above.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:01:52__

> It's annoying the way the app asks if you want to log out whenever you press the 'back' button. In other Android apps the back button just takes you back to the previous screen - it shouldn't try to log you out from the app. If you reply to the question to say yes I do want to log out - it just takes you back to the fingerprint log on screen - which seems rather pointless !!!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 17:51:32__

> Please fix the back button behaviour. It's confusingly different to normal Android apps. It should go back to the previous screen (as the Back link at the top does), not offer to log out.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 11:42:12__

> I had difficulty uploading proof of my ID because the camera button on the app does nothing. Had to record photos and video then subsequently upload. Don't know if it's worked yet but but this seems a pretty big flaw<br> :date: __2021-04-26 18:38:12__

> Quite @<br> :date: __2021-04-20 14:15:14__

> App was great especially for ordering replacement prescriptions but all of a sudden it states "Sorry, you cannot order or view repeat prescriptions online" please help as I work shifts and its hard enough collecting scripts let alone trying to get to doctors to order a repeat prescription??<br> :date: __2021-04-18 17:42:43__

> It took ages to accept my ID & still unable to view my medical records & only the medical summary , although I have been given access by my Surgery?<br> :date: __2021-04-15 18:32:13__

> Why not have an option to enter your voluntary covid rapid test result here. Seems so simple. Scan QR code, enter result, carry on with your life. Easy. Update, I've seen your reply. If I can add my rapid test result I can't find where. Pls send specific instructions to the correct page.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 16:13:56__

> I had a reply from the developer, after saying the app sticks when installing, but it said that it reflects what access my surgery have given me. I never got that far, just tried to install it, and all that happened, a large blue and white NHS logo with a circle in the middle rotating. If this is going to be used for vaccine cirtifications, it's not working for this phone.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:04:23__

> As to be expected after the track and trace fiasco, this app is very much a work in progress. Verifying your ID is nigh impossible and it can be 24 hours or more to find verification has failed for the third or fourth time. If the government are going to introduce vaccination passports for foreign travel they will need an alternative that actually works.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 07:30:23__

> Hangs with Please Wait message after scanning face<br> :date: __2021-04-28 15:01:53__

> Sent a massage to my gp, just a general question, now I cant send messages?? Why is that??<br> :date: __2021-04-27 15:21:09__

> Have made a video of myself saying the given numbers but can't move on....<br> :date: __2021-04-26 16:12:45__

> Does not send security code to phone. Have yet to get this app to work successfully.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 07:46:32__

> It's okay 👌<br> :date: __2021-04-13 17:49:01__

> Impossible to satisfy requirement for photo of licence or passport. As both documents are covered with a shiny membrane it is impossible to get the glare free image thus app demands.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 14:56:15__

> Not enough information no health record. And not up to date....<br> :date: __2021-04-05 12:40:28__

> Basic records about yourself, its ok<br> :date: __2021-04-02 08:40:05__

> This app. is impossible to set up..tried again, waste of time . Not helpful for elderly , far too complicated..<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:00:18__

> Log in is continually interrupted by code no's being fed in while you're trying to enter it. If you don't enter it in time approx 2seconds you have to go back to the start with your email address<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:50:15__

> There is no zero stars rating. Clunking, prone to crashing, redirects me to a search for login pages instead of starting the login process, and when I try to upload my driving licence image, it just grey screens me and hangs, then stops working and turns itself off. I do hope they didn't pay a developer for this app, because the NHS has been ripped off again if they did. Its useless. Y<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:44:43__

> Very poor and frustrating. Unable to login as NHS no and Post code cannot find me<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:44:05__

> I have been trying for 2 days now to download the app but just keeps pending.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:06:40__

> Rubbish idea to use this for Covid certification. How can anyone in NIreland use this system????<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:56:50__

> After trying unsuccessfully for over an hour to register using my passport photo I gave up. I sincerely hope things improve if this app is to be used as proof of Covid vaccination or negative result after testing.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:24:15__

> Hopeless, clunky way of verifying ID. App would not recognise driving licence photo so sent video instead. 24 hours later I'm still waiting for it to be approved.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:03:19__

> I am already signed up with NHS online and Systmonline and can do everything that online services can offer. So why on earth does the app want to take me round the circuit of reproving my identity? This doesn't appear to offer any additional services nor add any security. I'll stick to Airmd.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 09:51:51__

> Couldn't connect to surgery after days of trying so got my registration details and after inputting manually and getting to the end all i get is another technical error ref - CID7007 so I still can't use the app...very disappointed!<br> :date: __2021-04-29 08:58:25__
