### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-23 20:49:07__

> I can find my covid pass easily and everything seems clear. Only issue is that I can't seem to download it as a native app and have to go through app store every time I want to access it. Strange.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 18:30:44__

> For the great effort, the newer improvements, vaccine passport , easy to reorder the prescriptions<br> :date: __2021-07-23 13:30:43__

> Very easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-23 09:36:00__

> Really helpful in reordering prescriptions and saves me time<br> :date: __2021-07-22 23:06:46__

> Super easy to use. Got the Covid passport within 20 minutes of downloading the app. Couldn't have been easier.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 21:41:35__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-07-22 19:40:06__

> Very easy setup because had previously setup desktop browser access using the 3 codes sent by surgery. Therfore no hassle taking photos etc experienced by other reviews. A pleasant surprise that technology worked!<br> :date: __2021-07-22 16:20:56__

> This app cool bro innit man<br> :date: __2021-07-22 14:04:28__

> Due to my age, I cannot complain for the wonderfull service I am being given. I only wish more adults over 60yrs could be more involved in their treatment. a. Why they're being given certain drugs and how it works in their body and the side effects. Also how they can be given alternative drugs instead of being ask to continue on the same Medication with no response. Some of my friends complain about the pain they go through when they could be given Etoricoxib which is one of a group of medici<br> :date: __2021-07-22 11:15:09__

> Home icon does not work on every page but that might be something to do with my device. I use to have access to my full medical records & test results but that function disappeared when my surgery updated their software which was a complete disaster and in spite of repeated messages to the developers I never once received a reply. It would be useful if within the app one could request full medical records access as we all know calling a surgery can be a fruitless and frustrating experience.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 11:40:51__

> Not a lot of time to put number in<br> :date: __2021-07-23 09:49:58__

> So far so good. Setup was straight forward with email and phone verification codes. After that all my details came up along with my covid pass. It would be nice if the covid pass could stay permanently on a screen so it's easier to access each time you need to use it. But app is good and works well on my old Moto G6 phone.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 08:54:58__

> pretty good but lacks a bit more simplicity. It is not adapted to the new times. Every time you want to make an appointment or something opens the browser or redirects you to the official website. Being such an important app, I suppose that everything could be done from within.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 17:01:29__

> Struggled to get past the setup ID check (a plain off-white background and no bright lights helps) but got there in the end. Shows my vaccination status for Covid correctly. Don't know about the rest as I'm not on any medication, have no allergies, and have no current NHS appointments...<br> :date: __2021-07-21 16:44:07__

> Fantastic but login could be improve.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 15:33:05__

> Works good . Able to get straight in and all info is correct . Would prefer an option to book a nurse appointment instead of having to ring up the surgery and have to wait 45mins plus to get through.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 10:04:52__

> Utilitarian, it works.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 08:25:58__

> Great app & easy to use. As a carer for my mother, I've also been able to link her details so I have access to book both our appointments, see upcoming appointments & order our repeat prescriptions all in one place.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 03:11:52__

> Cannot access this..just get the blue screen and buffer going round and round.. Update ...thank you for responding to me. I can see my OS will not support so will access Web browser instead...no worries and thanks Paul<br> :date: __2021-07-20 02:10:15__

> A good start. It doesn't do much yet and i dont need it for much. However seems easy to use. In the future it would be great to be able to contact your GP directly on it and maybe even video call<br> :date: __2021-07-23 19:07:00__

> Worked pretty well, but still with a few bugs. I can imagine the less tech experienced would struggle to get the app to behave. Needs more work, and a clearer interface.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 10:42:25__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-07-21 06:13:21__

> Why don't this app open on my tablet just keeps going round and round<br> :date: __2021-07-20 19:52:17__

> Absolute garbage minus 10<br> :date: __2021-07-20 19:13:03__

> Vaccine passport QR code for is travel is faulty . It crops the right hand edge of the presented QR image (S21 Ultra)<br> :date: __2021-07-20 16:47:14__

> Dificulty in finding login, I have to enter Google play first can't find a way of logging in just screeds of what it does.<br> :date: __2021-07-20 13:50:19__

> Only seems to be good for ordering repeat prescriptions. Otherwise I still don't have full access to my medical record. After asking and been told it "had been done". Also my last two referrals and appointments have not shown at all within the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 19:28:31__

> I've seen funerals move quicker than the time it takes for this app to load. I need to prove myself to view my health, prescriptions etc and when I click that, I'm still waiting 20 minutes later looking at a loading screen. I have full signal so it's nothing to do with that.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 18:35:03__

> It's a great app and is very useful<br> :date: __2021-07-18 10:15:14__

> Poor<br> :date: __2021-07-23 08:36:27__

> It's slow and doesn't look nice<br> :date: __2021-07-22 23:05:24__

> Worked ok now saying service unavailable so cannot use app, not alot of help really when you click try again nothing happens.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 18:26:44__

> Last week, qorked fine. Early this week, had logged me out and no amount of password resets etc worked. Today, works with the exact same password.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 08:24:05__

> Getting very frustrated with this app. I'm trying to link to my surgery and it keeps saying something went wrong try again later. It also gives an option to click a link and add the details manually but keeps saying the linkage key is wrong. I checked with my surgery and they did something and said I should now be able to get in, but no joy. Why are government apps so pants?<br> :date: __2021-07-21 20:28:57__

> Constantly freezing app and had to force close app.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 16:35:59__

> 'The video is too small' bug. Tried a few methods<br> :date: __2021-07-21 15:57:22__

> Not the best app to use (if that's what you call it) - makes you login everytime, but once your in the info in the app is relevant and usedul. App says finger print isn't turned on?? But my fingerprint works with every app. Please ensure the app is an app and not a website!<br> :date: __2021-07-21 12:57:27__

> Has got the wrong data for my 2nd vaccine!! How do I correct this? Have been in touch with the vaccination centre where I had my vaccines. They have corrected it on the system but 2 days later your app has still got the wrong information!!<br> :date: __2021-07-21 12:56:38__

> Stuck on the loading screen now for 5mims plus.. Tried to uninstall and still unable to get past the loading screen. Flawed by design as everyone needs an up to date phone. To use the app. In answer to your reply maybe you should have gone to an older version.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 19:37:52__

> Not easy to navigate. Constantly takes you round in loops. Not at all easy to prove my ID. I still don't know if my ID has been accepted - there doesn't seem to be anything to let me know if this has or hasn't happened so I don't know how long to wait before trying again.

> I downloaded this app a while back thinking it would be an easy process ... WRONG!! You cannot get verified without a Driving License, Or European Photo ID. I do posses a uk photo id card (which was rejected - surprised, nope) If you have neither it makes the process far too complicated. I only tried downloading this app for the ability to show my vaccination status, gave up now and gone with a paper version. Never downloading this again!!<br> :date: __2021-07-23 13:26:37__
