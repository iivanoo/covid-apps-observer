### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations.

<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> At the age now where you lose tech savvy knowledge, found this easy to use and follow instructions to download and set up the App. All done, downloaded to pdf and printed off both vaccine certificates. Also sent to my email address all within 1hr. I think the issue is some people are declining cookies which need access to phone camera and video recorder to prove who they are. Well done NHS TEAM 👍👍👍<br> :date: __2021-07-19 11:21:32__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2021-07-19 10:57:28__

> So easy and simple to set up and use. Worked a dream and my passport was showing updated with my vaccination within minutes. Just remember you can use this for your gp services also. I just allowed all access requests and it works a treat.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 09:26:59__

> No issues installing or confirming ID. From installing to being able to access my proof of COVID jabs took about 15 minutes (including confirmation of my ID). Google Pixel 2.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 15:20:50__

> Very easy to set up, took less than five minutes to set up, I have access to my medical report on my computer but nice to have everything on my phone, covid passport took less than a minute to get on the app<br> :date: __2021-07-17 13:55:03__

> This app works perfectly for me. Sign up is a bit of work but ok if you are used to smartphone stuff. I can order repeat prescriptions easily and see when I last ordered. I have used this for over a year with no real issues - clearly shows c19 vaccination status now too.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 13:18:54__

> I'm actually really impressed with this app. Easy to register, easy to set up security and fingerprint login, easy to navigate, easy to get covid passes. Basically does what it says on the tin. Haven't use the book appointment or prescription features yet but if it works then will be awesome.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 12:15:32__

> Easy to say set up, reassuring with the Covid Pass<br> :date: __2021-07-17 10:09:54__

> Downloaded, signed up for an NHS account. If you have your NHS number, this makes it much easier Got it all working within 5 mins even with my kids distracting me. Couldn't have been easier, COVID passport ready to go!<br> :date: __2021-07-17 08:56:18__

> Love it, used for covid info, NHS Number and many appointments.<br> :date: __2021-07-17 02:32:40__

</p>

> Pretty good. Not had one problem with it.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 10:11:21__

> Seems very useful - but I haven't yet used all features. COVID vaccination information is accurate and detailed. It would be easier to use if the BACK Android button doesn't close the app and should instead navigate to the previous screen.<br> :date: __2021-07-18 09:42:34__

> Taken a long tme...still not open<br> :date: __2021-07-16 14:23:50__

> Rubbish.over an hour to try to give details then ran out of time so told to start again<br> :date: __2021-07-16 12:54:09__

> Makes repeat prescriptions easy. Includes a covid vaccination record. Lots of promise for more use.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 20:20:14__

> Good to use<br> :date: __2021-07-15 13:19:21__

> Works great for me but I've yet to try all the features, like appointment booking etc. Signing up is a bit of a faff, but fast and reassuring security processes. Interesting to see the medication I've had since 2016, useful if you have to keep track of meds, get repeat prescriptions etc. Some links in the conditions search that are meant to you to additional advice just point to a generic and unrelated pages. Glad it debunks homeopathy in the treatment area.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 23:40:07__

> Happy with the current functionality. Covid status and repeat prescription facility works well. The major annoyance is that the intuitive use of the BACK button at the bottom of Android screens does not work. You need to use < back at top left of screen. The pop up error warning is a real pain. Such a simple fix to implement.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 09:03:41__

> Contained too much info. Takes time to navigate and find what you want. But still worth the 4 stars given. Maybe 4.5 stars<br> :date: __2021-07-13 11:17:21__

> Top app,<br> :date: __2021-07-13 09:21:11__

</p>

> It's a great app and is very useful<br> :date: __2021-07-18 10:15:14__

> Downloaded app for proof of vaccination status for covid passport, but will having problems getting passphrase, or and does not let me upload photo ir documents for proof of ID Also does give access to hospital details<br> :date: __2021-07-17 22:24:37__

> The app is great but I've downloaded it from the android play store and there isn't an app icon on my desk top on my phone so having to access it thru the web browser is a bit of a faff<br> :date: __2021-07-17 11:30:59__

> Different batch numbers to paper card?! And worse still, the batch numbers on the app is the Indian produced Az vaccine now reported as being refused entry to the EU!!<br> :date: __2021-07-17 09:23:15__

> I couldn't pass id check. It shows message with some problems with my video record. Looks like some phones make problems. Solution - I asked my friend to record video on her phone, then she sent via bluetooth to mine, and I uploaded it as a file. It works.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 16:45:17__

> Can't find my information or pass<br> :date: __2021-07-15 16:15:51__

> How can I get my covid pass to show it keeps saying no covid 19 records found I've had both Jabs<br> :date: __2021-07-15 12:03:47__

> Impossible to log on. Don't bother trying. Asks for all sorts of ID that you don't have and it cannot access the phone camera even after permission has been granted.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 23:27:35__

> My NHS App is only showing my first Covid Vaccination but it isn't showing my second vaccination. My GP said I had to call 119 to update the record but 119 said they won't as my GP needs to do this! Who is right as I need this updated urgently!<br> :date: __2021-07-14 18:20:14__

> So you need to send a photo of yourself with passport details and driving licence details to prove who you are. How will NHS know it's me when the NHS has NONE of these things in the first place? A bit suspicious... and for that reason I won't be sending any I.D.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 17:05:32__

</p>

> Needs update<br> :date: __2021-07-18 22:15:15__

> Is it a website, app, or both? Won't let me use fingerprint login, error 'We could not change your fingerprint settings'.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 23:51:41__

> Do not have any of the photos ID required, just a bus pass?<br> :date: __2021-07-16 22:41:15__

> Logging in. No problems. Photo taken. Scan photo taken. Now stuck in loop. Camera will not allow video to verify me. Why can I not go back to scan. I have Android 9. And have opened up camera permission s. But still cannot verify.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 11:56:33__

> I use samsung galaxy note9 and downloaded this app to get vaccine passport. For proving ID, i am able to take photo of and upload the photo id ( so camera permission is definitely on ) but the next step to open camcorder always opens file manager. Just can't get past it. Frustrating experince for a simple task that this app cant get righ.and i am not using any niche platform or phone. Update : I contacted NHS app support via website. A day later received response with a link which worked.<br> :date: __2021-07-16 01:08:44__

> Awful navigation, not up to date and really hard to use.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 23:16:05__

> Can't proof my identity because for my face recording app can't open my camcorder even access are allowed<br> :date: __2021-07-15 20:23:05__

> I want to be able to display my proof of vaccination status, but when I go to 'get your covid passport' all get is a couple of text boxes with further links with information about trial events and travel. No instructions whatever about how to actually get the passport. And by the way, I have a paper driving licence and a non- UK passport, which from reading other reviews seem to be part of the process. What am I supposed to do?<br> :date: __2021-07-15 11:46:16__

> Has got the wrong data for my 2nd vaccine!! How do I correct this?<br> :date: __2021-07-15 09:28:10__

> Really needs the option for 2fa via an authenticator app adding (and not via SMS).<br> :date: __2021-07-15 06:41:02__

> I downloaded this app twice and on both occasions had the same problem. When trying to log in for full access, I followed instructions to upload ID then was asked to video myself saying 4 digits but despite having given permissions the app wouldn't allow the camera option to open to complete the task. I've since installed the app. Most disappointing!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 11:38:20__

> For the last few days the app has been returning a - technical error, please try later- at every log in attempt. Worse than no app at all.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 10:25:35__

> Terrible<br> :date: __2021-07-18 22:31:05__

> Poor<br> :date: __2021-07-18 21:02:25__

> This is rubbish<br> :date: __2021-07-18 20:46:53__

> Why does the app need me to upload my passport photo and scan my face, when my wife's app does not?<br> :date: __2021-07-18 20:16:10__

> This is not responding for registration by text. Tried umpteen times. I am pretty sure about 10 codes will come through in 4 days time.. no good to me..<br> :date: __2021-07-18 18:39:24__

> Not recognizing any of my details<br> :date: __2021-07-18 18:13:54__

> The nhs keep telling me that they have not got my email address and yet the email me with a failure to register by email !<br> :date: __2021-07-18 17:12:59__
