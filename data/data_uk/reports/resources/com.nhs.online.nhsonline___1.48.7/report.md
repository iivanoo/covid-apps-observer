### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Seemless and perfect for me. Only took a couple of minutes to set up. Can't understand all the complaints about this app. Too many non IT literate whingers out there!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 20:00:27__

> Excellent.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 16:12:43__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:00:59__

> Still getting to know how good this app is, but so it's doing ok, hence the 3⭐ Hopefully it will be better once we have our vaccine status added, to help enable us to travel further than our back garden!! Update: Been using the app for a few weeks now, and changed the rating to 5 ⭐, it's now much better since the vaccine status was added.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:16:39__

> Helpful with my covid vaccination passport<br> :date: __2021-05-28 19:07:15__

> Extremely good<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:44:12__

> No problem setting it up selfie and NHS number cleared checks within 30 minutes<br> :date: __2021-05-28 16:31:47__

> No scanning I<br> :date: __2021-05-28 15:37:33__

> So easy to set up and very well thought of app. Long overdue but at last easy uniformed access to your most important records. Well done.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 15:00:56__

> If you need your proof of COVID vaccination in downloadable printable pdf and you have already registered with NHS online, this app is all you need. Worked first time. Way better than unusable myGP for this task - obviously.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 12:09:39__



#### 4-star reviews

> The app works really well. My only issue is that I can't fully utilise it as my doctor does not have the online appointment facility. Otherwise, I really like it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 09:55:54__

> It is a functional app - it let's you know your vaccine status and if you need repeat prescriptions you can order direct from the app. Other than that the app isn't much use as most other data is not considered sharable - this is the sane as System online - my GP uses this app for repeat prescriptions but again it doesn't show test results or anything else that pertains to me<br> :date: __2021-05-29 17:32:21__

> I'm not really sure why this has such a low rating. I find all the NHS userfaces very easy to use. Big clear buttons and instructions. The main issue id say is the time in processing your ID. But this is the only real way to make it secure so it's understandable. I can't comment on the covid passport yet as my ID is still under review but the app is good to use so far<br> :date: __2021-05-27 15:31:37__

> I've just downloaded the NHS app set up very straightforward, only took ten minutes everything was great could view my repeat prescriptions, view my Covid vaccination and batch number very useful,. Could view nomitaed pharmacy ,. then I tried to access my medical record I got a message saying You do not currently have online access to your medical record , contact your gp surgery for more information.What was the point in setting this up.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 14:51:45__

> Easy to install. For booking appointments, and looking at past test results etc, better than the EMIS offering that my GP surgery already has. I think I can guess why the 2D bar code showing my vaccination status has an expiry date, and I am hoping that it will be renewed in good time. However, it would be good if this can be made clear within the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 15:40:26__

> Would be better if I could log on without password but not by using fingerprint. It would be much quicker and possibly more secure to use my screen lock pattern. I would appreciate your comments on this please.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 10:57:48__

> The initial security checks seem a bit excessive but it seems to work well. There seems to be a bit of crossover with the patient access app for ordering prescriptions and booking doctor appointments.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 10:46:07__

> Great but my samsung wont let me get app pn google playstore why?<br> :date: __2021-05-25 21:14:43__

> I've had this app a while and find it very helpful in contacting GP, ordering prescriptions etc. Will be really useful in the future now it also shows my covid vaccination details. One concern I do have is that new app users need to have a photograph. When I downloaded app this was not a requirement. Will the app be acceptable to other parties/countries to prove covid vaccination status without a photo matching my passport? As an existing user is there anyway for me to load a photo?<br> :date: __2021-05-25 10:19:23__

> No Mr Paul Phallus you are wrong!<br> :date: __2021-05-30 11:06:29__

> Don't expect or need this to do much except to prove I've had the covid jabs. So frustrating that it won't allow Google to remember log in. Why?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 20:31:01__

> This app is not very good. My husband downloaded the app so that he would have access to his covid status. On checking his vaccination details are completely wrong. Have sent details, still waiting for a reply. Also my doctors don't use this app....have now taken advice as given by NHS and problem has been sorted.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 10:39:25__

> Update: i kept trying throughout day and finally i got a reset email, so I'm sorted now. Honestly couldn't say where or what the issue was, but I've not had a problem on other apps with this Set up app easily enough, but on trying to check my vaccination status i cannot get access as it either isn't recognising my password or I've forgotten it. So, requested to reset and 90 mins later, I'm still waiting for the reset email! Doesn't fill one with confidence that this is a stable functioning app!<br> :date: __2021-05-28 08:58:37__

> Can't upload UK residence card? There isn't the option for that. You should have it as UK residence card holder are allowed for NHS. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-05-26 19:45:10__

> Stuck in GP link, won't show vaccine status as says needs to link to GP. GP will not provide option to do this.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 19:36:45__

> Poor. At first it worked then when I tried it the next day it keeps saying internet problem try again. I've reset my password and still the same<br> :date: __2021-05-26 15:24:48__

> The App is good but the finger scan does work<br> :date: __2021-05-25 22:02:00__

> Used first time today after obtaining necessary credentials from my surgery. Convoluted access and needed to login again to share records with others. Saw my CV vaccination status and prescriptions but not much else. ( Note: "manufacturing" should be spelt with a u not an a ) Not impressed so far but early days<br> :date: __2021-05-25 18:43:02__

> Well, the app does do what it says it does, and the covid certification is fairly easy to get to once logged in. There are some issues though: registration's a dog. I was already registered with my surgery's online service and had my NHS number ready - still took forever to register with this. Also, as said by everyone, the android back button is broken when using this app and will log you out instead of, er, going back, as the app is (sadly) a poor iOS port rather than written for purpose.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 14:10:12__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Booking a COVID jab is impossible, everyone is booking the same appointments concurrently which makes it impossible to complete a booking, and if there is no second appointments available why show the original appointments, same issue with the arrival times. It seems to be also not handling the volume of requests either as it keeps going down. You'd think for a critical gov tech infrastructure you'd think about handling spikes in traffic better. I have a few smaller gripes with the ui also.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 11:31:26__

> All going ok until I tried to submit the video required to verify identity. Despite taking the video using camcorder it doesn't show the video image, only the sound, so the verification failed. Using Samsung A50 so hardly an old or unusual make of phone. If this App is to become the way to verify vaccinations then it's got a long way to go.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 23:26:39__

> Can't upload video,each time recorded,it takes back to begining and you TV gave to start logging in again,but changed the number<br> :date: __2021-05-27 22:48:47__

> Not the best as I can not log into it as it won't open the camera function making it impossible to prove my identity.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 21:11:44__

> Can't get it to link with my video to verify I am who I say I am.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 17:14:30__

> The app will not open my camera so I can't register. I've tried a number of times.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 10:36:34__

> Yes, set this up after a lot of hassle using a browser when it kept saying you need to give improov app permission to use camera when there was no app called that on my android phone. Then downloaded app and uploaded passport and video, all setup now BUT cant logon with face recognition (my phone has it) as no option. Covid vaccination status is designed for A4 not mobile screen and barcode expires in about 3 weeks, why ? I've been vaccinated that doesn't expire does it ?, QR code cant be read.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 14:10:13__

> Every time you press the phone's 'back' button to go back a page (like every other app does), this app instead asks if you want to log out. Terrible UI.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 09:00:11__

> Doesn't seem to work for Scotland, hopefully they will improve the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 00:08:49__

> Has to have a different email per user<br> :date: __2021-05-25 17:25:48__

> Absolutely impossible to download, far too difficult to Access covid status<br> :date: __2021-05-30 12:28:19__

> I will be in the middle of doing something and then it just hangs. It is very frustrating<br> :date: __2021-05-30 11:11:20__

> Doesn't work in Wales. UK government is racist.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 00:52:43__

> Does not work<br> :date: __2021-05-29 23:13:00__

> Awful. Followed log in process. Lo and behold does not accept and wanted me to start again. Suffice to say uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 22:29:39__

> Filled in my email address... and waited. Checked spam filter.. nothing.4hrs... Did it all again... still nothing. Now 6hrs. Other mails arriving fine. Do replies depend on an intern who works Mon-Fri 9-5? Oh well, try again in a few months, when it's out of alpha.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 22:11:16__

> Agree with other comments, a good example of how not to develop an app. It's over complicated, god only knows why they didn't take lessons from banking apps in respect to ease of use and security. Plus the back end infrastructure is bust. Been waiting for days for a text message with my security code<br> :date: __2021-05-29 20:46:28__

> Can't log in, always getting the experiencing technical difficulties page. Can't log in to change my contact details, can't book my jab or gain access to any of my records<br> :date: __2021-05-29 20:01:46__

> After five efforts to get identity verified,and failed, I give up! What a shame,should be great if it works!!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 20:00:27__

> Might be good if you can get past all the security checks only to go back and start again.<br> :date: __2021-05-29 18:49:14__
