### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-18 07:56:38__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-04-15 10:23:35__

> Informative website. V useful in these difficult times<br> :date: __2021-04-15 09:45:57__

> This app is simply brilliant in every respect. However, in the last week I keep getting error messages at every turn. I've asked tech support and followed their instructions but need more help. I'm still waiting. The 5 star rating is entirely because of months of positive experience.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 23:31:43__

> Excellent service<br> :date: __2021-04-14 22:01:33__

> Love this app, has made managing my life, especially through shielding, so much easier.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 12:08:40__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-04-11 21:06:58__

> Installed app and had it up and running in 10 minutes, very easy if you read and make note of what the app needs. I now have access to all my medical records, I can now request repeat prescriptions or gp appointments via the app, it keeps track of any and all Covid tests and results, it also shows when I've been vaccinated and if I've received both... It works better than my Gps app..<br> :date: __2021-04-10 23:59:41__

> Installed and registration validated within five minutes. No issues that I can see.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 18:15:48__

> Problem initially experienced resolved, simple - the app only caters for one email address per patient , no shared address so applied a different address for self and problem solved. Not sure why identity is by email and password as opposed to NHS number plus password which appears more logical but all is well that ends well.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 12:57:31__



#### 4-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Clear, concise both in appearance and content. Mostly stable. However, when interfaced with other large/complex databases (eg. registering Coronavirus home testing kit) tends to malfunction at times. Thus the four-star rate.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:14:46__

> It's ok<br> :date: __2021-04-14 21:31:46__

> Straightforward, secure, easy to use. Information is easy to understand. Only negative is some services are not supported by my GP practice.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 15:07:39__

> Straight forward to register and follow the unusual security checks which is reassuring to have in place for our own privacy protection. Very handy to be able to view what medication we had on our records including the Covid-19 vaccination. In my case there is an anomaly which I can see if going through the GP Services link on the app will allow it be dealt with. Also would be handy to show appointment made for our 2nd vaccination.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 14:05:36__

> Been using this app since it was introduced without any issues, and it offers slightly enhanced historical info against Patient Access.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 13:41:30__

> Pleased that the industry is heading towards integration of the services.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 13:25:51__

> Excellent app for prescriptions very quick.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 18:28:29__

> Seems easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-13 12:47:23__

> Easy<br> :date: __2021-04-10 22:59:45__

> Good for quick repeat orders for myself. But please can you add a feature to let us add our children to the app<br> :date: __2021-04-08 11:43:13__



#### 3-star reviews

> It took ages to accept my ID & still unable to view my medical records & only the medical summary , although I have been given access by my Surgery?<br> :date: __2021-04-15 18:32:13__

> Why not have an option to enter your voluntary covid rapid test result here. Seems so simple. Scan QR code, enter result, carry on with your life. Easy. Update, I've seen your reply. If I can add my rapid test result I can't find where. Pls send specific instructions to the correct page.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 16:13:56__

> Really needs improvement, it keeps freezing when i try to log in or register my identity<br> :date: __2021-04-10 12:16:00__

> Bit of a palaver getting set up, but I understand the reasons, and it was all fairly quick in the end. Main reason I installed the app is that my NHS surgery website says that the app shows the patient's vaccination history, including those for Covid. I thought this would be useful, however I can't find any information about my vaccination history, Covid or otherwise. Where is this vaccination history information to be found on the app please?<br> :date: __2021-04-08 09:42:36__

> Would it be possible to name econsult then have a sub menu Dr/ administration request etc , current system is confusing especially for elderly<br> :date: __2021-04-03 12:03:14__

> My registration was going well until I encountered the same problem as another reviewer; 'open camcorder' takes me to 'My Files' and not the camera. Tried all the suggested fixes (of no use whatsoever) but it's still the same. I've already reported to the developers but I'm concerned that such an important app has these types of bugs. Changed from 1 to 3 stars as the developers answered immediately ans advised me to complete the registration on a different device (laptop) which worked.<br> :date: __2021-04-01 17:49:47__

> Trying to set up account and camera will not open - so cannot make the video!<br> :date: __2021-03-31 16:10:14__

> Very slow lots of error messages<br> :date: __2021-03-30 01:55:07__

> Ongoing log in problems. Always have to input email address & password. No short cuts. Option to change to fingerprint doesnt work<br> :date: __2021-03-28 09:47:13__

> The app is still showing an error when trying to see or reorder prescriptions?<br> :date: __2021-03-27 14:00:55__



#### 2-star reviews

</p>

> It's okay 👌<br> :date: __2021-04-13 17:49:01__

> Impossible to satisfy requirement for photo of licence or passport. As both documents are covered with a shiny membrane it is impossible to get the glare free image thus app demands.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 14:56:15__

> Not enough information no health record. And not up to date....<br> :date: __2021-04-05 12:40:28__

> Basic records about yourself, its ok<br> :date: __2021-04-02 08:40:05__

> It's clearly work in progress, so I do hope to see increased functionally progressively being delivered through the App starting with my full medical records. Specifically I want to see my recent blood test results and my full vaccination records (tetanus etc, Covid-19 etc). I was shown this today at the vax centre on an iPhone, but mine is Android and I cannot see this information.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 14:14:27__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-03-26 15:47:27__

> The app has my full medial records which is great, but the hospital referring user journey is poor. firstly it didnt notify me there was a referral, secondly, when I found it by chance, it allowed me to go through to the end, but then said the app couldnt book and that i have goto a website. whats the point of the app then ? The website asked for an access code which I have never been given. This is a bigger problem than just the app. Would be happy to be an end to end user tester.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 12:38:53__

> It used to be good. You could book appointments easily and so on a great way to keep in contact with you doctors..... unfortunately now it is only for vacations.... yes it is a priority but people still people get issues that aren't virus related! Please put it back to what it was with a section for vacations<br> :date: __2021-03-26 08:47:19__

> Can't link to GP - either using link or manual registration- system not recognising account linkage key obtained via Patient Access. Please advise<br> :date: __2021-03-25 22:54:16__

> I managed to register and get through the verification easily enough. Unfortunately though, I can only see my basic health info and despite being on the phone to my GP's practice manager for 20 mins going through the instructions for their system supplied by the support team, it refuses to display any of the enhanced 'coded' information such as test results and vaccination history. I'm hoping a follow-up email to the support team may get us further.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 22:53:37__

> Useless!!! it doesn't show me my appointments half of my medical history isn't there the concept of it is a good idea but for the reasons above I render it useless<br> :date: __2021-04-17 13:50:46__

> Will not open up<br> :date: __2021-04-17 13:37:04__

> Unnistalled this app. Followed all the process, uploaded my ID, recorded the video saying the security numbers provided, completed the registration with my name, date of birth, address. Received an email saying would get a confirmation of my registration after 24 hours, received said email after one week saying registration cannot be completed since my details don't match, living in the UK for nearly 20 years, same address & GP clinic for over 5 years. Not worth it.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 13:11:06__

> Rubbish...Track & Trace could have done better... I could do a better job. This is as useless as they come..<br> :date: __2021-04-17 12:54:58__

> Useless app can't use it without being registered with a GP<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:50:32__

> Terrible. Stops at section where you record video saying numbers. Useless, do not use. I recorded vid of my mum quite clearly, wont go beyond that stage.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 11:49:19__

> Can't get it to open<br> :date: __2021-04-15 18:40:04__

> Absolutely useless app. When trying to confirm my identity it asks you to make a video saying some numbers. Gives you the numbers and when you press to take a video, it goes into your saved files. Even if I make a video separately and add that, i have to go through the whole stupid process again and of course it gives you different numbers. Whoever designed this app is completely clueless<br> :date: __2021-04-15 16:18:49__

> Pants I tried MANY TIMES to verify who I was without any luck. I gave up and deleted app. Please make it a bit more user friendly. Do you try these apps out on "normal " people before you release them????<br> :date: __2021-04-15 12:55:00__

> Poor and bossy guidance that does not facilitate access or inclusion. Hateful waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 09:17:30__
