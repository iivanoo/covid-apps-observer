### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App works well up having to upload the camcorder section ,then left in limbo<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:56:45__

> I managed to register myself and my wife separately, as didn't realise I would be able to get her linked to mine, with a few problems with proving ID. Works ok, though sometimes seems to have a glitch. I wanted full access, so have contacted my GP. It has been set up from their end, with me also having proxy access to my wife. I am able to get the full proxy access to my wife but no full access for either of us in own accounts. not sure where problem is though.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 20:27:06__

> Works pretty well for me...<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:42:57__

> Very easy to join, maybe because already knowing NHS number, very straightforward. No need to add passport details etc as mentioned on other reviews. Hopefully we will be able to use it as proof of vaccinations when travelling without having to download any other app.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 17:31:41__

> Very good. Takes a bit of time to set up if you don't have all the required details but easy if you do have them.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 09:33:07__

> Took sometime to sort I.D...managed to print off covid paperwork..but why is it valid for only 3 weeks ????<br> :date: __2021-06-01 19:40:55__

> Understand you need to verify, can be fidly to get right<br> :date: __2021-05-31 15:01:13__

> Great application. I managed to get my GP to approve a continuous order for my medication Through the app. without me having to call the GP or book an appointment. Very useful app. I'll give 5 stars if this app will give me the chance to get Covid-19 Vaccine certificate as proof for travel and for any other required reason. I wonder if this app will be approved to use as a green pass to travel.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 21:56:41__

> WINDOWS 10. OPEN GOOGLE PLAY FOR NHS APP. ADVISED THAT APP IS INSTALLED. UNABLE TO FIND IT. CHECKED "DOWLOADS" NOT THERE. SELECTED "INSTALLED" . SELECTED "INSTALL" just in case. NO RESPONSE. ANY IDEAS? HAVE DOWNLOADED IT ONTO MY PHONE SUCCESSFULLY.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:28:40__

> The app works really well. My only issue is that I can't fully utilise it as my doctor does not have the online appointment facility. Otherwise, I really like it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 09:55:54__

> Tried to register for the app. Will not recognise either my NHS number or address details perhaps its because I live I Scotland and this is only for NHS England.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 12:48:46__

> If you know your NHS number you should be abke to register. The app is essentially only web browser with no extra features.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 21:26:04__

> Difficult to use. ☹️<br> :date: __2021-06-04 16:44:40__

> This app has no close option. I have to close it by using close all option. It needs a proper close or exit option in app. Otherwise it is excellent<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:17:46__

> Just the camcorder section don't confirm things<br> :date: __2021-06-02 10:48:13__

> Setup was flawless, however and it's a big however it is only displaying my records from my new GP surgery! This is a bit silly as I hardly have any records here and most are at my old surgery... Also I was kind of expecting to see all my NHS hospital records in the APP which I can't see anywhere.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 20:20:11__

> Not very easy to use and set up the same issues with my GPS e consult service. I am above average with technology and I really struggled to set it all up. I understand the NHS is so pushed to the limit but the service made me want to give up if it wasn't so important.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 18:48:18__

> Surprised how little information was required to access my medical details. I used different email address than the surgery knows about, but might have used the same phone as I've given the surgery, so perhaps they have taken the opportunity to validate that the phone details I entered in the app match what the surgery holds. The surgery has emailed me to say I can now use the NHS app, but has failed to warn me what I should do if it was not me that has attempted access my details with the app.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 02:49:50__

> Don't expect or need this to do much except to prove I've had the covid jabs. So frustrating that it won't allow Google to remember log in. Why?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 20:31:01__

> This app is not very good. My husband downloaded the app so that he would have access to his covid status. On checking his vaccination details are completely wrong. Have sent details, still waiting for a reply. Also my doctors don't use this app....have now taken advice as given by NHS and problem has been sorted.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 10:39:25__

> Tried to sign up, I've input my mobile number a dozen times, and still waiting for a 6 digit code but no joy.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 14:17:09__

> After 3 days have still been unable to complete registration!!<br> :date: __2021-06-06 12:19:50__

> Waste of time and effort badly thought out and poorly executed<br> :date: __2021-06-04 13:30:23__

> Managed to register and the rest OK, but keep getting error message "An unexpected error has occurred" on mobile and laptop when trying to access share proof of my Covid-19 status for travel. Am I doing something wrong?<br> :date: __2021-06-03 20:46:30__

> It will not install<br> :date: __2021-06-03 09:27:36__

> Not very up to date had my 2nd AstraZeneca jab 2 weeks ago still shows me as only having the 1st one.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 16:10:34__

> Worked great initially but after a week it now fails to allow me to log in (with a '3a' error code). Repeated failed attempts over 24 hours have led me to conclude it's not fit for purpose. Update for the Devs: I've submitted two reports and both have simply come back with the (automated) reply that I should give it 30 mins or so. Since then I have had no response.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 14:24:36__

> I registered no problem but proving your identity it is very hard ,it always go back to step 1,do i need to prove my identity every time i logged in ?thanks<br> :date: __2021-06-01 17:28:17__

> (at the time of my original review it was possible to book a vaccination through the app) Booking a COVID jab is impossible, everyone is booking the same appointments concurrently which makes it impossible to complete a booking, and if there is no second appointments available why show the original appointments, same issue with the arrival times. It seems to be also not handling the volume of requests either as it keeps going down. You'd think for a critical gov tech infrastructure you'd think about handling spikes in traffic better. I have a few smaller gripes with the ui also.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 15:09:49__

> Gone through all the setting up process to be told it doesn't work in Wales so a total waste of time<br> :date: __2021-06-06 10:54:46__
