<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is a great app to motivate me to walk more and I now walk briskly to make my daily exercise more worthwhile. Love the graphics and celebration when I achieve my daily goals. Recommend for those who sit for long periods as it motivates you to move more.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 15:05:05__

> Have used for a few weeks so far. It's working for me. Gets me out walking every day.....<br> :date: __2021-01-26 12:10:19__

> I have used the app for a couple of weeks and it is easy to use. You can increase your walking time if so wish. It has motivated me to go out for a walk daily.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:12:13__

> Very good, except for the encouragement texts that arrive at 3 o'clock or thereabouts in the middle of the night and wake me up when my 'phone pings an "incoming" message alert.....<br> :date: __2021-01-28 06:41:47__

> This app is really useful to help you feel like you achieved something. Would be nice if it told you how far you walked, but believe it works on motion not GPS so makes sense why.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:57:02__

> This is a good encouraging app. It doesnt always record every active step. I did one hour at a constant 6mph but the spp only recognised 40 minutes as being active but it could be my Sony Xperia l suppose. Never the less the app does motivate me and keeps me conscious about the amount of exercise l do.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 11:15:17__

> Enjoy using this have tried others with no success!<br> :date: __2021-01-24 10:27:57__

> Returned to app to ensure I was doung enoygh, so it's good to know enough of my steps are "brisk".<br> :date: __2021-01-23 11:11:42__

> Clear and simple. Stays on constantly so no need to remember to activate it.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:03:50__

> Updated review, Jan 2021, reinstalled the app again and it is working again, as before, when it's working, I really enjoy this app, I like setting myself targets and it encourages me to complete an extra 10 minutes if I have just gone over. June2020: This started out great, used it at start of lockdown to make sure I brisk walked for my daily exercise. Then one day it randomly stopped working. tried uninstalling and reinstalling, no good, a shame I enjoyed it whilst it lasted.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 20:04:24__

> I wish there was a calorie tracker and the option to up your goals but its really motivated me to start walking! And I'm loving it.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 12:20:47__

> It's great to be reminded just how active you really are! So you can up your game.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 20:14:49__

> I know I have walked brisk sometimes but the app does not alway pick it up<br> :date: __2021-01-29 10:14:37__

> Good idea I guess it got me off the sofa but it doesn't always seems to work, seems to depend on which pocket my phone is in which is slightly demotivating.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 09:12:34__

> Not been using for long. But clear and concise<br> :date: __2021-01-22 13:38:54__

> It's an ok app. As long as you have your phone in your pocket it records the time you are moving and how much of it was brisk. It does seem to lose the information from one day to another though, which is a bit annoying as you could compare your movements over the last week or months - pointless if it doesn't save continuously. The app does have information, or rather links to other areas, ie healthy eating.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 12:57:15__

> OK when it works but very frustrating when it doesn't record a walk even when the phone is being carried in exactly the same way as it always is. Is now claiming that I haven't opened the app for 39 days when I used it the preceding day. Missed recordings have happened so often now that I'm looking for an alternative.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:54:18__

> Found it really motivating but appear to have 'lost' a weeks walking!<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:12:38__

> Not consistent. The same walk everyday. The faster the walk often results in less time recognised as brisk walking!<br> :date: __2021-01-17 10:49:13__

> I like the idea of this app. But it seems to have wiped all my walks this week telling me it needs to update.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 09:12:49__

> I really liked this but since updating it has lost a number of days which defeats the object. I'd rather have an accurate record than badges!<br> :date: __2021-01-14 07:53:37__

> I really like this app as it is an excellent way of keeping track of brisk minutes and seeing progress. Unfortunately I have also found since updating yesterday it keeps deleting my daily walks. Very frustrating and I really hope it gets fixed soon.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:03:39__

> Although it's an encouraging app, I've noticed it's not completely accurate but helps general motivational. I would be really happy if it actually measured the distances walked or run.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 14:56:11__

> Regularly does not track my brisk walking unless I hold the phone in my hand while I walk.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:53:20__

> I walked, and my walks were measured and I got a badge , great! Then walks disappeared😐uninstalled and re installed.. same thing🤷👎 Good idea, but its not working properly<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:35:42__

> Works fine on IOS but poor on Android - keeps stopping - can't adjust the target. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still same. All my other apps work fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 02:54:31__

> Really liked it for first 2 days but now day 4 it only shows first days walking and hasn't recorded that I walked at all today. It doesn't open properly but takes me back to Google Play to open it from there. I had high hopes for this and recommended it to friends but I'm now disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:10:29__

> Stopped working on 3rd day saying it couldn't retrieve my walk data🤔<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:50:33__

> Lost previous days walk data at the start of every new day. Pretty frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 08:57:10__

> Used this app really successfully until this week when it's not storing daily levels so can't compare any more. What's happened? Disappointed<br> :date: __2021-01-14 15:51:31__

> Disappointed. Following update several days walks not recorded or have disappeared. If this continues will research another app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:54:12__

> Definitely loved the app but doesn't work following update. I've logged 3 days walking this week which subsequently disappears and doesn't update weekly or monthly summary. It's not working at all. Disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:14:31__

> Hopeless. Now worse. Keeps saying I might lose data as I need to log in every 30 days. I am pleased to see the return of rewards but when are you going to get the basics to work properly? It is showing 42 mins brisk walking today though I've only just got up but nothing at all for yesterday when I went for a long brisk walk and my data for 12 days ago never did appear.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 11:21:17__

> Installed first time and registered brisk walk, next few days nothing. Unistalled the Installed again and still not registering brisk walks or steps. A good idea but not working. Now unable to register as will not accept my Post Code / email address.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:01:21__

> This use to work, it's broken now<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:37:53__

> A good app for raising blood pressure, not so good for encouraging walking. It seems to forget data despite the update. For instance on the day it says 20 minutes, look at your history and it's only 5.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:36:30__

> Loses walking data within 24 hours which is really annoying despite the update on 15th January.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:33:18__

> Broken since last update!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 07:40:26__

> Worked for first day then said update now does not keep record of each days walking not good 😒<br> :date: __2021-01-17 11:47:28__

> Update has killed it 😓 nothing saved and nothing to see other than a few random badges, shame as I did like it before - uninstalled<br> :date: __2021-01-17 01:27:00__

> I loved this app when I first started using it, as it was an easy way to keep track of my progress, but like others, I'm finding that it keeps stripping out all of my stats, so starting to think I'll not bother using it anymore unless a fix is done very soon - such a shame<br> :date: __2021-01-16 21:47:54__

> Walks keep disappearing from my history so pretty useless to track my progress.uninstalling<br> :date: __2021-01-16 15:21:44__
