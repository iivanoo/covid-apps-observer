## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I would like it if the app could save addresses that I frequently use.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 14:52:11__

> There is no option to delete tracking numbers on the tracking tab. The app need a feature where the user can delete individual or all track history!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 15:35:12__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-02-17 11:33:01__

> No matter how many updates this app has, it still doesn't work, crashes upon opening everytime. I have been unable to use the app since February 2020 on a Sony Xperia XA1. Sort it out Royal Mail. Update, 13 Feb 2021 decided to try this app again and installed it again, it now works, opens, can login, and view my saved tracking numbers. Let's see how long it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:14:54__

> OK..<br> :date: __2021-02-09 20:35:17__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-01 14:04:05__

> Improving thanks<br> :date: __2021-01-23 21:31:53__

> It's not a bad app for tracking parcels. Just would really like to be able to delete them from my list once they've been delivered. Any chance?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:25:38__

> World's be useful if it allowed you to delete previous tracked items<br> :date: __2021-01-12 10:14:01__

> This app is useful for tracking when your parcel will arrive.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:45:28__

> Normally a fantastic app. But all it seems to be doing is crashing ATM<br> :date: __2021-03-23 09:03:44__

> Will not let me do change of address or any other services.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:46:46__

> Claims tubes that meet medium parcel dimensions are too big.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:00:00__

> Everytime I go on the app my session has expired and have to log in quite frustrating<br> :date: __2021-02-08 08:48:09__

> I use primarily for tracking incoming and outgoing parcels. Cannot edit description when inputting data which leaves me with columns of meaningless numbers until I am eventually allowed to manually edit once RM have clocked the item in system which is very slow and tedious. Unedited numbers are also duplicated in list and shuffled around making even more work! And whatever happened to push notifications? More and more I am having to use third party apps to help with tracking and sanity. 🚛🆘☯️<br> :date: __2021-02-07 15:31:01__

> When you click on a URL to the tracking number on another app suck as a email, it directs to this app instead of a web page which would be great but it doesn't phase the URL and extract the tracking number then take you directly there.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:34:29__

> Tracking Don't Update most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:07:13__

> Sorry, an error occurred, can't install it, done the redelivery through site, just uninstalled.....<br> :date: __2021-01-18 19:42:45__

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> Looking for cost of posting to Europe (Ireland). Can't find on this site!<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:19:33__

> Used this app twice now to buy postage and both tines had to input info numerous times then when ptint your label at home constant error messages, it will allow me to pront a qr click and drop A4 label but that's not what I want so now I have to drive 10+ miles to the nearest mail drop office. I will be removing the RM option from my selling site.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:21:07__

> App won't open. comes up with a notification saying that it's unable to open and I'm left to tap either app info, close app or send feedback. If I tap send feedback it tells me my phone isn't connected to a data service. Seems a lot of hassle to report a problem 😕<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:17:09__

> Useful to store your sending history, that's about it. No way to save my details or edit addresses, and I can't use card info saved to my phone when paying for postage. Even hermes can do better...<br> :date: __2021-03-11 02:21:32__

> So much room for improvement. I have to enter all my details every time I use the app, why can't it remember my name and address???? A list of favourite destination addresses would save loads of time as well. Tracking means where is it now, not we'll tell you after we have tried to deliver!! Also, why not attach the label to the email I receive to save me having to fiddle about downloading the label from the app before I can print it? Come on Royal Mail, a few teaks would make this a genuine alternative to your competitors.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 13:09:13__

> Good to track your delivery but changing deliveries to another location its useless. I update 2 deliveries for other location (post office) and when i got home i got the something for you card... don't make sense!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 12:23:27__

> It won't even let me print the label I've paid for<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:36:11__

> A GOOD APP,BUT NOT THIS ONE, THE ROYAL MAIL ,TRACK AND TRACE,IS INFALLIBLE,BUT HAS TO BE LOCATED BY GOOGLE SEARCH,WHICH IS LUDICROUS ,AS ROYALMAIL 'TRACK AND TRACE' IS THE BEST OF ALL-. -. --THIS APP IS,MOST DEFINATELY, NOT WORTH A LIGHT, IT'S EASIER TO SIMPLY PICK UP A PHONE,AND RING THE 'LOST PROPERTY' .WHY ON EARTH YOU WOULD PUT THIS APP ,IN THE MOBILE,IS BEYOND ME! YOU CAN'T EVEN GET RID OF THE THING FROM THE PHONE!!! SINCERELY,MARKUSBRUTUS.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 02:44:11__

> Finding it difficult to use<br> :date: __2021-02-10 12:14:09__

> Got there eventually but not a straight forward process. Like something from 2010.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 08:08:07__

> Useless they delivered to my house every day but don't have my address in the app therefore cant even log on or do anything<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:24:17__

> Whats the point of registering if app can't even remember your details and you need to type it all over again every time you want to use it? I tried to book redelivery but it just shows a message: "sorry there was en error". Completely useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 14:16:04__

> Utter trash, what is the point in entering my address details to sign up for an account if I have to re-enter the same details when booking a re-delivery? Assuming the form even works (it didn't for me). Absolute useless app! Don't waste your time, just use the royal mail website instead.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 13:22:27__

> Useless app, Royal Mail tells you to expect your parcel one day and you never receive it until the next day or the day after that.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 08:24:40__

> Doesn't work if you have an Android. Pointless, just use the website.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 05:50:48__

> Rubbish, keeps restarting as soon as I try to open the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 23:21:37__

> Tracking is useless Shows item dispatched to Royal mail on 9th March no update Other items say no update till its had an attempt to delivery which obviously I know where it is at that point<br> :date: __2021-03-24 13:01:58__

> Pathetic delivery service. They are using covid as excuse. Whole world is working only Royal mail has issues in covid. Missing so many posts and weeks of delays.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 11:19:47__

> Much how I would imagine the mental torture inflicted on prisoners of war to be. I have wasted my evening going down a rabbit hole for a trackable parcel that 'cannot be found' by this app that I have been forced to download, because it is apparently the ONLY way to get my parcel redelivered.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 23:02:06__

> Utterly useless<br> :date: __2021-03-23 16:37:00__

> Latest update, now the app just crashes on the loading screen, think I'll just give up on it and send my post with someone else.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 23:36:30__
