### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you‚Äôre at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you‚Äôve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we‚Äôve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm not sure if this app updates regularly enough I live in Swansea area Wales and its saying that my area is still in high risk level 4 but I thought that it was supposed to be lowered to three because of further relaxation of rules<br> :date: __2021-04-30 15:29:10__

> I thought caf√©s should be all table service, including ordering?<br> :date: __2021-04-30 15:03:26__

> It works in that it scans. Gladly haven't had a notification.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 13:21:28__

> Useful, I like this app, handy to know if I've likely been in contact with the virus. Only thing I don't like is it has no log out of venues. This could mean I would be contacted if someone who later tests positive was visiting the venue after I'd left.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 08:02:16__

> easy to use. had to delete tons of games and videos but worth it....although now not sure, I get a notification showing I've got a message...open the app, nothing!<br> :date: __2021-04-29 22:39:08__

> Cool<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:52:14__

> Could be improved by allowing the home test lateral flow test qr code to be input through this app<br> :date: __2021-04-28 17:01:08__

> No longer opens and crashes. No idea if it is working. Update: app now started working again after a few days of crashing. Update 28 November: yet again has stopped working. Same issue as before, doesn't open and crash error messages pop up randomly. Bad for a public health app to not work.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 09:35:35__

> QR scanner needs to be able to read fastflow qr code<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:56:06__

> Has been working but over the last few days it uses way too much power my 48 hour battery now lasts just 4 hours. I'm having to disable the app.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 08:30:58__

> Very limited in function. Can't use to report lrf tests<br> :date: __2021-04-29 14:49:56__

> I work in a care home, and report my several weekly tests via the website. Surely, if I am registered on one of these, both should maintain my records, scan in my tests, and report them? I don't understand with all the free testing going on, you can't just scan these in?<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:46:54__

> Great app everyone needs to download but now app has got worse with latest update as the link to the UK government covid web site has been removed..was good in that u could see the latest covid data update without having to open a browser...please put the link back.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 13:12:05__

> Is this app authorised in Scotland, if so why does it only say authorised in England and Wales, is there another app for Scotland??<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:11:46__

> The app works fine.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:17:12__

> Essentially going to be your 'vaccine passport' Hard pass. Joking aside having to keep the Bluetooth on drains your battery rapidly. Would be better working off of GPS if possible. QR scanner is a neat touch and simple to use, but the follow up I. E exposure notification needs looking at.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 09:11:02__

> I received the code from NHS after the test, and app says: "Your code wasn't recognised. Please make sure you are using a valid code." Please be careful.
