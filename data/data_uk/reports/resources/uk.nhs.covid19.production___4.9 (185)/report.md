### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Brilliant if your sight is good, your spelling is bad then it's no use.As for Covid yes it was useful, even then it failed, as gave false information out, I was left not knowing weather I had Covid or not, had to be in lockdown for more than the stated time, out of food for a month, no one checked if I was ok, no one popped in to see if I was still alive and kicking, I gave the correct five star because it gives me information about illnesses, and meds that's all.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:13:57__

> Useful for the current situation we are in with this virus. Hopefully we can open up with fewer deaths than previous waves. We'll see how it goes but it's like a routine in my daily routine, signing into the venues I use and sit outside of<br> :date: __2021-05-09 15:59:29__

> Venue QR code does now work<br> :date: __2021-05-09 12:42:53__

> Update:Why can't we report LFD Test results? Works fine. All negative reviews are for pre- public version. Always people looking to criticise.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 14:44:53__

> Peace of mind<br> :date: __2021-05-04 21:32:09__

> The only reason Y I was on your phone was the fact of the team that you are going to be able and if it doesn't work for your partner and you don't have the right information on the internet is not just about your computer and you will need it to make it easy to use the internet connection 😇🖕🤑<br> :date: __2021-05-04 19:45:56__

> Told me someone close to me has covid,the important/test? notice disappeared and could not be retrieved. There is no information on what to do about this! Apart from that,very good. Notifications should be stacked and dated. App uses contact tracing and qr code check in system. Pubs, bars and restaurants must have a qr poster in view. now easing has taken place of lock down, how far can I travel for the shops, necessary walking? The latest advice page is a confusing big read.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 14:03:47__

> Im sorry but I've had the app for a while and found out my freind who I was in contact with had covid and yet my phone didn't alert me you need to sort this out please<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:22:27__

> the interface is awkward and clumsy, also sometimes I get red indication on app but when I check, nothing. it doesn't inspire confidence<br> :date: __2021-05-08 15:11:54__

> I have tried to enter the result of my Covid test. I was asked to enter the code that was listed on the email received which gave the result. My phone rejected the code, saying that it was not recognised. I checked the code several times, each with the same result<br> :date: __2021-05-07 15:27:16__

> Please add I'm home button to disable app running in the background asking for Bluetooth to be switched on constantly. I only want to use the app when I'm outside. Thanks.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 14:39:27__

> Leaves a notification on the phone saying loading and battery life seems to have gone down so uninstalling it. Load it when I have to and uninstall afterwards.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 16:47:37__

> NHS app stops my phone connecting to my car. Rather annoying, hands free doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 12:24:14__

> It's OK. Tbh tend to forget that I have the app on my phone as the only codes that are compatible are the resteraunts and the occasional shop ( many are only now re-opening) while other locations that have codes such as all the Flying Start locations don't scan and have to go online and manually register each visit.<br> :date: __2021-05-04 08:12:57__

> D BBC news sez da number of ppl who've had sex n don't listen in other countries WHILE THOSE SAME STATISTICS R DIEING IN MY COUNTRY?! R they actually married? I'm not fake pls go away<br> :date: __2021-05-04 05:03:46__

> It works to a point. Like Hotel California I can check in to venues but I can never leave! Some of the options don't immediately make sense. For example if you don't check any boxes on the symptom checker your next option includes Remove, which offers nothing more than to un-check the boxes you haven't checked! Hopefully it will get better. Note reply: No intention to improve - obviously content with creating nugatory work for tracers. A year on and nothing changed despite many "updates".<br> :date: __2021-05-03 20:53:11__

> A lot of nonsense.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 23:46:09__

> The app has downloaded however it will not allow me to check into venues and tells me this is unsupported. I have a Samsung M31 running on android 11?<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:11:18__

> Having issues with it, will not let me enter my recent result which makes me unconfident about it's ability to inform me if I am exposed to someone who is positive but unable to enter the result<br> :date: __2021-05-08 01:47:19__

> Very difficult to use, especially to report a test. I am unable to use the QR code reader. More importantly I cannot enter the ID number if they begin with the letter 'L'<br> :date: __2021-05-06 15:34:11__

> Can't report a test on this site using the number on the strip, as the number is not valid also no option to scan the QR code.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 12:31:27__

> poor app<br> :date: __2021-05-04 23:03:50__

> This app is useful and has potential but there should be an option to select when you're leaving a venue rather than being logged in till midnight. *edit* in response to the developer, that's exactly the problem I'm highlighting. If I go somewhere 10-11am (for example) then someone who later tests positive is there at 2pm, there is no need to increase a person's anxiety when they have in no way been in contact with the positive case. With a check out option data and risk would be more accurate<br> :date: __2021-05-04 21:59:28__

> Just uninstalled and reinstalled..still out of date..showing high risk for my area..no point in having an app with out of date info. Update: I have already followed the instructions re uninstalling/ restarting phone, etc. The risk level info has not been updated. Poor app...I also have a Turkish covid app and it is far superior to this UK version..<br> :date: __2021-05-04 18:58:32__

> I had covid and didnt even tell my girlfriend i was positive in same house<br> :date: __2021-05-03 20:11:32__

> I dutifully downloaded this deceptively named "NHS' App It seems pretty useless to me. It's never given me any warnings; it looks as if I'd have to enter a test myself if I had one (I never have so far) and it does not show my vaccinations. All this in stark contrast to my daughter's German app which shows everything automatically and very promptly.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 09:45:08__

> Total waste of time how on earth can this be used as a vaccine passport<br> :date: __2021-05-07 21:33:54__

> The police has access to your location and information. Strong no.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 21:14:30__

> Does not show vaccination certificate, despite government claims. Does not show negative PCR test despite code being accepted. I hope no-one needs this for going on holiday.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 20:06:00__

> App stopped working. Is this app obsolete? If so it should be removed from Google Play Store.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 17:07:49__
