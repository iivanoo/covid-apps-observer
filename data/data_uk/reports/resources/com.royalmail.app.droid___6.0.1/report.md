## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> No collection service option. Was expecting to purchase my postage and select a collection in one simple app. But no, the new parcel collection service doesn't seem to be available as it is on the desktop site. Very disappointing as their competitors make it so easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 21:57:33__

> I don't use snail mail very often so don't buy stamps. For me this app is very welcome since it means not having to go online to buy postage. What it lacks and needs is the ability to print straight to an envelope rather than a label (their old service had this). It would be good if it could store your information so that you do not have to enter it each time. So good start Royal Mail now develop it further<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:46:24__

> Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish<br> :date: __2020-11-24 16:56:31__

> Primative at best. Very far behind in the tracking area compared to other tracking apps.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 03:27:27__

> Really good idea but be so careful when printing out labels.....the app tends to hold onto the last label bought so you may end up sending the item to the wrong person as I did<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:38:40__

> I have received text messages from you saying that my parcel is due today at a certain time, and it's showing me that it has been delivered today, but i don't have any parcel, so can someone tell me what is going on with my parcel please, thanks. Mr. Edmond Cairns. EH65EW<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:27:13__

> No tracking updates, no option to saved details, no copy and paste option.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:00:55__

> Keeps saying error messages when performing basic functions. Uninstall!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 11:50:51__

> This app stresses me out lol<br> :date: __2020-11-06 12:42:20__

> You should add options for our tracking items where it should be if we're not at home. For example , where should we leave your package? In the shed etc.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 04:04:45__

> Want too much info and password setting is a joke<br> :date: __2020-10-30 00:09:31__

> Ok to track parcels, completely useless to alter delivery. Tried it twice so far, both times the request was ignored and I was bombarded with texts and e-mails advising me parcels couldn't be delivered on the day I'd already said to not deliver on. Then had to rebook the already rebooked delivery as the original request had been deleted! The app looks nice and is easy to use. Shame it seems to have absolutely no use other than that.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 21:08:28__

> Waste of time, keeps coming up with validation error when trying to book a redelivery.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 22:35:25__

> Useless app, will not allow me to print the label. Comes up with message saying there was an error processing my request. Booked a collection, so they are collecting my parcel with no label on it tomorrow.!! Cannot find record of order online either. Send query, will have to wait up to 10 days for a reply.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 15:47:02__

> Such a shame that I can't sign up - there is an error on both phone and tablet!<br> :date: __2020-11-29 14:16:14__

> Annoying you have to type your full address in to register. Yup, the royal mail app doesn't have a postcode lookup. Sending parcels? Get ready to enter your address as the sender AGAIN. Want to view your collections, you have to enter the number, they're not stored. Come on Royal mail, think!<br> :date: __2020-11-29 13:51:47__

> Didn't work<br> :date: __2020-11-29 10:29:02__

> Never works<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:56:56__

> Terrible... won't let u redeliver why launch a app when its clearly not ready<br> :date: __2020-11-29 02:18:48__

> Rubbish. As others have mentioned: - You have to download the app to re-arrange delivery. Why can't this be done on the web-site without downloading an app? - You then have to go through lots of registration questions - When you want to re-arrange delivery you have to re-enter your name & address that you entered on registration. Why is there no option to use your registered name & address? - If you enter the ref number with spaces as printed on the card left it fails so you have to take the spaces out. What sort of amatuer software is that?! - Then after all that it throws a validation error. Total waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 19:59:20__

> Redelivery Hell, Scan QR Code, last page of sign up error... Cannot get past it.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 19:18:29__

> Dire app. Went through whole registration process only to find I have an account but couldn't get link to reset password. Typical government dept app, built by ppl with no idea of working with customers.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 16:10:11__
