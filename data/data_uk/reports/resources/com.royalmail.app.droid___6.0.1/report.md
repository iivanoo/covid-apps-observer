## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> No collection service option. Was expecting to purchase my postage and select a collection in one simple app. But no, the new parcel collection service doesn't seem to be available as it is on the desktop site. Very disappointing as their competitors make it so easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 21:57:33__

> I don't use snail mail very often so don't buy stamps. For me this app is very welcome since it means not having to go online to buy postage. What it lacks and needs is the ability to print straight to an envelope rather than a label (their old service had this). It would be good if it could store your information so that you do not have to enter it each time. So good start Royal Mail now develop it further<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:46:24__

> This app is generally useful but has two flaws. It doesn't remember your name and address, so every single time I print postage for a letter I have to re-type my it. Plus the need for a title when I only know someone's forename and surname is frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 14:13:11__

> Really good idea but be so careful when printing out labels.....the app tends to hold onto the last label bought so you may end up sending the item to the wrong person as I did<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:38:40__

> I have received text messages from you saying that my parcel is due today at a certain time, and it's showing me that it has been delivered today, but i don't have any parcel, so can someone tell me what is going on with my parcel please, thanks. Mr. Edmond Cairns. EH65EW<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:27:13__

> No tracking updates, no option to saved details, no copy and paste option.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:00:55__

> Keeps saying error messages when performing basic functions. Uninstall!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 11:50:51__

> This app stresses me out lol<br> :date: __2020-11-06 12:42:20__

> You should add options for our tracking items where it should be if we're not at home. For example , where should we leave your package? In the shed etc.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 04:04:45__

> Want too much info and password setting is a joke<br> :date: __2020-10-30 00:09:31__

> Ok to track parcels, completely useless to alter delivery. Tried it twice so far, both times the request was ignored and I was bombarded with texts and e-mails advising me parcels couldn't be delivered on the day I'd already said to not deliver on. Then had to rebook the already rebooked delivery as the original request had been deleted! The app looks nice and is easy to use. Shame it seems to have absolutely no use other than that.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 21:08:28__

> Why does RM require one to sign up just for tracking a simple item? I don't see the point of making an account with RM app for such a simple thing. RM needs to change this feature on their app wherein you can track status of an item without having to sign up / log in<br> :date: __2020-10-27 11:51:31__

> Validation error trying to book redelivery.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 23:43:57__

> Added details address password etc etc then get a message "error, sorry we are unable to deal with your request ". No next step or reason why or what to do next.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:16:34__

> Awful waste of time why not just let me simply arrange a re-delivery on the website instead I have to go through account set up on the app only for it not to work!<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:56:56__

> Worthless. First off why do I need a app to book a redelivery. Secondly why do I need a app to book a delivery that can't even work.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 21:30:42__

> Absolutely shocking that an app of this quality has been released by Royal Mail. This would fail as a GCSE Computing project, it is that bad.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 17:14:12__

> Utter rubbish. Complete waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:28:18__

> Absolutely Rubbish, constant error message trying to book a redelivery.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:06:47__

> Terrible, wanted to pick up a parcel I missed while at work, went after work the next day since Google and their website said they were open but no. After calling them THE ONLY WAY TO TELL IF THEY WERE OPEN WAS BY DOWNLOADING THE APP SIGHNING UP AND CHECKING THAT WAY. Now I try to get onto the app again it refuses to allow me to do anything unless I go onto the website and scan a QR code. How the hell can royal mail think this is acceptable during covid, update your times on google.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:47:54__

> It's unacceptable to make you download an app to use their redelivery service. The app crashed multiple times and was very slow when trying to sort the redelivery as well so its not fit for purpose. You want people to stay home, well let them organise on the website, or at the very least get some better programmers.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:55:03__

> Don't waste your time. After you register it shows an error and you can't do anything<br> :date: __2020-11-21 13:57:11__

> Terrible app. No option to scan QR code. Long and pointless registration that you then can't use any of the details from to pull through for delivery and have enter it all again. What a joke!<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:42:47__
