### Description
> The NHS Ayrshire & Arran app consists of information about healthcare services maintained by the NHS Ayrshire & Arran regional NHS Board in Scotland. The app is published by NHS Ayrshire & Arran regional NHS Board.
<br>Each provided service contains a rich mix of authoritative information about your condition, lifestyle pointers, local and national resources you can access, contacts information, clinic schedules and emergency information should you get into trouble. Browse these whenever you need.
<br>In addition each service can, if you allow it, message you via targeted push notifications, saving time and cost for the NHS and delivering a better more relevant service to you.
<br>Simply type your healthcare service name into the search box, open the app and select the push notifications relevant for you in the Settings section.
<br>You can select, interact and receive notifications from more than one of our services in our app.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
