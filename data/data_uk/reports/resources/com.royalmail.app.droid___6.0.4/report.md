## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is useful for tracking when your parcel will arrive.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:45:28__

> Excellent.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 10:46:40__

> Very good app.clear and well updated<br> :date: __2020-12-30 13:01:14__

> Excellent app easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-18 15:14:40__

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__

> If you face any problems you can't open it just change your phone's language<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:39:13__

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> When i first installed the app it was great, but the last few days it repeatedly says my details are wrong and logs me out whenever i try and do anything.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 00:09:14__

> Looking for cost of posting to Europe (Ireland). Can't find on this site!<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:19:33__

> Tracking nos are alpha-num and long and I can't copy from my sources. Info seems sketchy. Update... uninstalled as won't accept my password, LIKE SO MANY APPS IT JUST DEFEATS ITSELF. Bah humbug.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 13:09:29__

> Unresponsive<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:30:00__

> My first experience started well, BUT I'd arranged for a parcel to be collected, got the notification confirming tracking ID, & specific day of collection by my USUAL POSTIE. However when the postie turned up, (luckily he had to ring the doorbell as he was also delivering a parcel) he knew nothing about the collection as nothing was logged on his PDA & he couldn't therefore scan it to track. He did however agree to take it & assured me it would be scanned back at the depot. We'll see 🤞<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:46:59__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> There is no way to change your password in the app or website settings, seriously?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:06:41__

> Won't let me sign up to track my parcel<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:03:10__

> It wasn't very helpful ive been waiting for a while for my items<br> :date: __2021-01-06 01:16:09__

> A lot of registration effort for nothing you can't do via their website<br> :date: __2021-01-02 12:25:56__

> This is the results of privatisation in app form. Doesn't even do the basics.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:01:07__

> I installed the app to get an update as to when my delivery would occur. I dont understand why the service is "deliver by 9pm" but you have no tracking ability. It's no wonder why services like heroes are used, as they let you know when they are an hour away, estimated delivery time. I wouldnt use the Royal mail if I have any choice, customers value the ability to know when the parcel will arrive, even if that's a 3 hour time slot.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:04:12__

> Desk top version much better. Why does this app insist on first name and surname when I am sending to a business?<br> :date: __2020-12-23 12:25:28__

> Pretty rubbish. The QR code takes you to the all, nothing else. You then need to sign up or log in and basically type all of the details from your "Something for you" card. Only then to find out you can't book a next day delivery but you can collect tomorrow. Like I said, it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 13:39:50__

> The registration process uses "opt out" for marketing preferences. And tracking of a special delivery just says "out for delivery" Both show just how archaic Royal Mail is. 1st class stamp prices always going up but can't do anything modern nearly as effectively as competition<br> :date: __2020-12-22 11:26:14__

> Rubbish takes far too long to update, they don't deliver on the day that they said that they would.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:49:45__

> I have waited two different days for this delivery and no one has been near our house with our delivery and I have had two separate deliveries with different couriers for my neighbour's so how is you say I am not in I am really disgusted<br> :date: __2021-01-09 15:06:00__

> I have multiple bad experiences with this company. They are very bad and they do what they want like nobody can do nothing about it. Is the only way tonlet the people know to not use the app is not updated to track your parcel so is useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 10:53:17__

> How do you remove old tracked items<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:55:43__

> Well it's 9pm my parcel is in transit 3 times from Romford!!??? And that was 3pm So I'm not getting it tonight I waited all day and you give no time slot, nothing and now I have to wait another day. This is ridiculous, I've just told Very that I'm never buying online again thanks to royal mail's incompitance. I had no idea when I was getting this parcel and I still don't. Yodel delivery had a phone number for the courier and was simple why can't you guys be more officiant for God sake. Avoiding<br> :date: __2021-01-08 11:34:01__

> You want my details so I can track a parcel .. whats the point of tracking numbers .. way to invasive just to help you deliver<br> :date: __2021-01-07 19:55:49__

> Don't appreciate Remove please.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:20:26__

> Awful trackers Don't get updated at all.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:14:24__

> Aweful app. Try to sign up and just tells you that your WiFi or mobile data is too weak. I have 5g and full wifi signal on my phone. Literally everything else on my phone works perfect but this app. Just avoid it and don't waste your time.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 17:11:23__

> Can no longer rename tracked items after last update. Also just get errors when trying to look at history of sent or tracked items...just get a processing error. Switched to using Hermes for all packages.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 16:52:31__

> This app is as much use as a marzipan dildo. Can't even install it. My item came from China, via a few south East Asian countries, and took just under a week to get to Royal Mail. That was two months ago. Its then up to us to sort out their mess. Unfortunately I think this is our future: Big business pushing out little business and providing meager customer services and accountability to no person. The CEOs of this company must have sore wrists with all that procrastination they participate in.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 20:45:57__
