## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's not a bad app for tracking parcels. Just would really like to be able to delete them from my list once they've been delivered. Any chance?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:25:38__

> World's be useful if it allowed you to delete previous tracked items<br> :date: __2021-01-12 10:14:01__

> This app is useful for tracking when your parcel will arrive.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:45:28__

> Excellent.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 10:46:40__

> Very good app.clear and well updated<br> :date: __2020-12-30 13:01:14__

> Excellent app easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-18 15:14:40__

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Tracking Don't Update most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:07:13__

> Sorry, an error occurred, can't install it, done the redelivery through site, just uninstalled.....<br> :date: __2021-01-18 19:42:45__

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> Looking for cost of posting to Europe (Ireland). Can't find on this site!<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:19:33__

> Tracking nos are alpha-num and long and I can't copy from my sources. Info seems sketchy. Update... uninstalled as won't accept my password, LIKE SO MANY APPS IT JUST DEFEATS ITSELF. Bah humbug.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 13:09:29__

> Unresponsive<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:30:00__

> My first experience started well, BUT I'd arranged for a parcel to be collected, got the notification confirming tracking ID, & specific day of collection by my USUAL POSTIE. However when the postie turned up, (luckily he had to ring the doorbell as he was also delivering a parcel) he knew nothing about the collection as nothing was logged on his PDA & he couldn't therefore scan it to track. He did however agree to take it & assured me it would be scanned back at the depot. We'll see 🤞<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:46:59__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Gives you no option to talk to a real person in a live chat when you want to find out what's happened to your package you go round and round in circles with the options they give you and end up no better off you would of thought a company as big as royal mail would have that option and more tracking info so far not impressed at all<br> :date: __2021-01-20 19:59:54__

> App can be good but is limited and annoying. If registered and track items if you are out on delivery it doesn't let you schedule redelivery using details on app.You have to manually enter everything including address to redeliver.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 17:19:05__

> No landscape support<br> :date: __2021-01-19 08:30:47__

> Rocky start. Firstly they don't tell you if your previous login from the old app has been carried over so I had to do a forgot password to see if my email is still recognised. Then I wanted to change my password. To do this in a standard way on any app you tapo the three lines to pull down the menu - so far so good, then you tap Account - oh no you don't there isn't one so you fumble about trying the obscure options and get know where. I still haven't found where the Account settings are.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 12:22:55__

> There is no way to change your password in the app or website settings, seriously?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:06:41__

> Won't let me sign up to track my parcel<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:03:10__

> It wasn't very helpful ive been waiting for a while for my items<br> :date: __2021-01-06 01:16:09__

> A lot of registration effort for nothing you can't do via their website<br> :date: __2021-01-02 12:25:56__

> This is the results of privatisation in app form. Doesn't even do the basics.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:01:07__

> I installed the app to get an update as to when my delivery would occur. I dont understand why the service is "deliver by 9pm" but you have no tracking ability. It's no wonder why services like heroes are used, as they let you know when they are an hour away, estimated delivery time. I wouldnt use the Royal mail if I have any choice, customers value the ability to know when the parcel will arrive, even if that's a 3 hour time slot.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:04:12__

> absolutely useless and stressful.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 16:33:41__

> Utterly useless - doesn't even have an option to open the app!<br> :date: __2021-01-22 14:09:46__

> Useless, rubbish app! It doesn't recognise your tracking number!<br> :date: __2021-01-19 18:29:31__

> Should display in the app on the tracking info who the sender is for signed-for items<br> :date: __2021-01-19 15:14:41__

> Wouldn't accept password. Reset password and it wouldn't accept new password. Waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 10:39:42__

> Shocking app<br> :date: __2021-01-18 16:08:55__

> As an Android programmer myself, I wonder why a new app version doesn't retain my login. It's not difficult 🤪<br> :date: __2021-01-18 12:01:26__

> Just awful<br> :date: __2021-01-17 20:58:07__

> Useless tracking. Very vague. No information. Just telling me stuff I already know. "We have it" ect. Useless. Use the website. It's not much better. But it is slightly more information<br> :date: __2021-01-16 21:01:17__

> The app added a login screen for more pointless data farming and and targeting. Just use the website and delete this app.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:42:13__
