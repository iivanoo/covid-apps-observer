## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__



#### 3-star reviews

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> Looking for cost of posting to Europe (Ireland). Can't find on this site!<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:19:33__

> Tracking nos are alpha-num and long and I can't copy from my sources. Info seems sketchy. Update... uninstalled as won't accept my password, LIKE SO MANY APPS IT JUST DEFEATS ITSELF. Bah humbug.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 13:09:29__

> Unresponsive<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:30:00__

> My first experience started well, BUT I'd arranged for a parcel to be collected, got the notification confirming tracking ID, & specific day of collection by my USUAL POSTIE. However when the postie turned up, (luckily he had to ring the doorbell as he was also delivering a parcel) he knew nothing about the collection as nothing was logged on his PDA & he couldn't therefore scan it to track. He did however agree to take it & assured me it would be scanned back at the depot. We'll see 🤞<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:46:59__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Rocky start. Firstly they don't tell you if your previous login from the old app has been carried over so I had to do a forgot password to see if my email is still recognised. Then I wanted to change my password. To do this in a standard way on any app you tapo the three lines to pull down the menu - so far so good, then you tap Account - oh no you don't there isn't one so you fumble about trying the obscure options and get know where. I still haven't found where the Account settings are.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 12:22:55__

> There is no way to change your password in the app or website settings, seriously?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:06:41__

> Won't let me sign up to track my parcel<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:03:10__

> It wasn't very helpful ive been waiting for a while for my items<br> :date: __2021-01-06 01:16:09__

> A lot of registration effort for nothing you can't do via their website<br> :date: __2021-01-02 12:25:56__

> This is the results of privatisation in app form. Doesn't even do the basics.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:01:07__

> I installed the app to get an update as to when my delivery would occur. I dont understand why the service is "deliver by 9pm" but you have no tracking ability. It's no wonder why services like heroes are used, as they let you know when they are an hour away, estimated delivery time. I wouldnt use the Royal mail if I have any choice, customers value the ability to know when the parcel will arrive, even if that's a 3 hour time slot.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:04:12__

> Desk top version much better. Why does this app insist on first name and surname when I am sending to a business?<br> :date: __2020-12-23 12:25:28__

> Pretty rubbish. The QR code takes you to the all, nothing else. You then need to sign up or log in and basically type all of the details from your "Something for you" card. Only then to find out you can't book a next day delivery but you can collect tomorrow. Like I said, it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 13:39:50__

> The registration process uses "opt out" for marketing preferences. And tracking of a special delivery just says "out for delivery" Both show just how archaic Royal Mail is. 1st class stamp prices always going up but can't do anything modern nearly as effectively as competition<br> :date: __2020-12-22 11:26:14__

> The app added a login screen for more pointless data farming and and targeting. Just use the website and delete this app.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 11:42:13__

> Very late delivery.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:18:51__

> This App isn't even worth much more than one word of complaint ....... "useless"!!!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 11:41:23__

> Struggled to scan 5 items - got there in the end. Collection offered next day. Went to pay - app crashed. It had not kept my collection of scanned items. Scanned everything again. Then it said no collections in my area! Waste of time - will have to put on full ppe and go to post office.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 19:28:45__

> App will not close after opening from a tracker link from an email and prevents further use of Outlook. Only a reboot solves it.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 18:21:59__

> The delays are unacceptable. I am waiting for like a 2 weeks for an item that was supposed to come next day. The said that because of covid they will take longer to arrive. If so why hermes, dpd and ups came with no problem with only few days of delay. When i say few day i meant 4 days of delay<br> :date: __2021-01-11 16:13:21__

> Useless app; useless phone system; useless website; useless company. How do I claim money back from items Royal Mail keep flushing down the toilet? This app is as much use as a marzipan dildo. Can't even install it. My item came from China, via a few south East Asian countries, and took just under a week to get to Royal Mail. That was two months ago. Doesn't even deserve a one star rating.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 14:12:27__

> Shouldn't need a login to track parcels.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 11:09:32__

> Utterly useless for redeliveries. Doesn't recognize code even though the website does. Tracks the code, but says the code doesn't exist for redelivery. User interface is terrible. Had to go through several screens before it bothered to check if my email address was already registered<br> :date: __2021-01-11 03:53:00__

> This application is totally useless and not fit for purpose. I work my way through it after logging in. I get to the find address part successfully. Then the process just stops. I cannot go any further. What use is that? Isn't it then supposed to print a label? Don't bother downloading this useless application. You will be wasting your time like I have just done.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 18:39:40__
