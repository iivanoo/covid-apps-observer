## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When you click on a URL to the tracking number on another app suck as a email, it directs to this app instead of a web page which would be great but it doesn't phase the URL and extract the tracking number then take you directly there.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:34:29__

> Tracking Don't Update most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:07:13__

> Sorry, an error occurred, can't install it, done the redelivery through site, just uninstalled.....<br> :date: __2021-01-18 19:42:45__

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> Looking for cost of posting to Europe (Ireland). Can't find on this site!<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:19:33__

> Tracking nos are alpha-num and long and I can't copy from my sources. Info seems sketchy. Update... uninstalled as won't accept my password, LIKE SO MANY APPS IT JUST DEFEATS ITSELF. Bah humbug.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 13:09:29__

> Unresponsive<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:30:00__

> My first experience started well, BUT I'd arranged for a parcel to be collected, got the notification confirming tracking ID, & specific day of collection by my USUAL POSTIE. However when the postie turned up, (luckily he had to ring the doorbell as he was also delivering a parcel) he knew nothing about the collection as nothing was logged on his PDA & he couldn't therefore scan it to track. He did however agree to take it & assured me it would be scanned back at the depot. We'll see ðŸ¤ž<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:46:59__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Got there eventually but not a straight forward process. Like something from 2010.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 08:08:07__

> Useless they delivered to my house every day but don't have my address in the app therefore cant even log on or do anything<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:24:17__

> Difficult to track things<br> :date: __2021-01-25 16:16:27__

> Needs quite a bit of work to make it worth having on the phone. It tells you you've had an attempted delivery, but with the same notification you cannot book a redelivery. Makes no sense.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 11:49:15__

> Gives you no option to talk to a real person in a live chat when you want to find out what's happened to your package you go round and round in circles with the options they give you and end up no better off you would of thought a company as big as royal mail would have that option and more tracking info so far not impressed at all<br> :date: __2021-01-20 19:59:54__

> App can be good but is limited and annoying. If registered and track items if you are out on delivery it doesn't let you schedule redelivery using details on app.You have to manually enter everything including address to redeliver.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 17:19:05__

> No landscape support<br> :date: __2021-01-19 08:30:47__

> Rocky start. Firstly they don't tell you if your previous login from the old app has been carried over so I had to do a forgot password to see if my email is still recognised. Then I wanted to change my password. To do this in a standard way on any app you tapo the three lines to pull down the menu - so far so good, then you tap Account - oh no you don't there isn't one so you fumble about trying the obscure options and get know where. I still haven't found where the Account settings are.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 12:22:55__

> There is no way to change your password in the app or website settings, seriously?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:06:41__

> Won't let me sign up to track my parcel<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:03:10__

> After reading all the reviews I didn't down load the app.. Bonkers you need it to rearrange delivery when you can't rearrange delivery with it<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:43:21__

> Error every time I have used it. The app is broken<br> :date: __2021-02-05 19:34:22__

> Frustrating - one of those "I want to throw my phone at the wall" time when an app just dies not do what is intended and keeps reporting "there has been a problem, try again" - There are only so many times a human being can do this without giving up and black marking a bad app.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 19:16:48__

> Difficult to use and opaque. Very difficult to use if you want to buy postage online. No ability to process refunds online if you make a mistake. Utter dinosaur of a system; I won't be using it ever again.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 17:02:12__

> DO NOT USE royal mail they are HORRIBLE I have had 3 parcel LOST and the people don't care HORRIBLE SERVICE use a competitor they will be much better even if it cost more at least you will have your parcels actually delivered if I could I would give it 0*<br> :date: __2021-02-04 21:51:15__

> All redelivery requests have so far been ignored, what's the point of the app if the post office take no notice! Minu 10 stars. Uninstalled.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 17:33:22__

> Diabolical. You've updated that you've delivered my post yet i do not have the post. Doesn't tell you where it is has been posted and trying to find how to get in contact with royal mail is non existent.... i still don't have my post and still not found away of contacting you. If i could give zero starts, i would<br> :date: __2021-02-03 19:20:14__

> Useless<br> :date: __2021-02-03 12:08:50__

> 1. Not optimised for my device? What does that mean? 2. Why do I need to sign up? Another password to remember! Loads more cookies! More unwanted advertising. I only want to track a parcel, do I really need to register just to do that?<br> :date: __2021-02-03 10:23:19__

> I paid my custom fee the other day and it's still being held for custom fee? I don't udnerstand mate<br> :date: __2021-02-02 19:18:46__
