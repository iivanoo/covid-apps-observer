### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotlandâ€™s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You donâ€™t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br>â€¨Once youâ€™ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:â€¨â€¨Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contactsâ€¨Slows the spread of the virusâ€¨Reduces the likelihood of further lockdownsâ€¨Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesnâ€™t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Education for Scotland |
| **Website**  | [https://protect.scot/index.html](https://protect.scot/index.html) |
| **Email** | testandprotect@nhs.scot |
| **Physical address**  | [NHS Education for Scotland Knowledge Services 2 Central Quay 3rd Floor 89 Hydepark Street Glasgow G3 8BW ](https://www.google.com/maps/search/NHS%20Education%20for%20Scotland%20Knowledge%20Services%202%20Central%20Quay%203rd%20Floor%2089%20Hydepark%20Street%20Glasgow%20G3%208BW%20) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> If people are putting in positive results, then why are they out and not self isolated at home? If my app says I've been in close contact then the person who put there positive results in are out and about. Not the apps fault that's why I gave it 5* people just don't care they can potentially kill another person....<br> :date: __2021-03-22 04:08:30__

> Early version seemed fine, sat happily in background, but now app complains when I don't have Bluetooth or location on at home.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 11:07:01__

> Couldn't add my positive code to the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 01:02:01__

> Of questionable usability. Stay at home, and this app will still keep nagging you to switch on location - presumably the vision of the Covid hordes invading your dwelling makes spending battery power on satellite navigation worthwhile. Now, I remember The Omega Man from the first time around (1971 film), but did the designer of this really do so too? ðŸ¤” I'd rather not be nagged at home to turn this on, thanks.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:13:23__

> It says it is unable to check for exposures as Bluetooth is turned off, but it's on.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 03:27:16__

> Seems ok<br> :date: __2021-03-09 20:15:55__

> Oooft photo.yruk<br> :date: __2021-02-25 12:44:41__

> None yet .<br> :date: __2021-02-18 22:15:08__

> I received a notification to self-isolate back in November. When I checked the periods of exposure on the Google notification page there had been no exposure checks for several days including the day I was allegedly exposed. It turned out I was nowhere near anybody that had corvid-19. My next door neighbour had tested positive a week or so before. The Bluetooth picked up the notification through the wall.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:22:32__

> Twice in three days I was contacted to isolate for 10 days despite never being in anyone's company inside or out within two meters I haven't even been near my own family. If passing someone on a pavement within seconds triggers the app for you to isolate then what's the point? They sell coffee at a door where people congregate on a pavement less than two meters to get past?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:03:34__

> Gave me a notification saying I had been in contact with someone with covid and had to self isolate....10 days AFTER I had been in contact with them and I only had to isolate for 1 day?? Not convinced it works or it is very slow to update you.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:05:01__

> When I first got the App I thought it was great to have it but now I am convinced it doesn't work giving people false confidence they've not been in contact with Covid, I have been in close contact with covid infected people yet never had notification. I think its flawed by requiring people to self input if they have it. Yet reading other reviews such as people in same household both entering details and none being informed that they've been in close contact? Raises suspension app authenticity<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:44:35__

> I was quite naive and feeling safe because I hwe receuved zero contact alerts, so was blissfully confident that I was OK. Until today that is, when I discovered that a) there was an update that was not automatically applied, b) there are so many criticisms of the app and c) so many complaint communucations to the developer remain unanswered.... Is the app a complete con? Is it just to calm the naive and stupid like me. I had not encountered any issues, but then I didn't expect to.. I was safe???<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:07:48__

> There is no way of knowing if it iseven working. Updates saying everything is fine you haven't been in contact with a positive person would be nice.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 13:30:55__

> Never had an alert no idea if that's working and there's no way to take two phones and do a diagnostic safe proximity test between them for reassurance. I simply don't trust this or the NHSEngland equivalent and I use both.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 04:20:30__

> I don't know if it works right..<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:40:25__

> Cannot increase or adjust the font size. I am severely visually impaired/blind.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 14:05:45__

> I had a message via the app once but when I clicked on it, it disappeared.theres nothing in app about using QR code...or how.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 09:03:08__

> Known not to work as positive testing patients do not put in their results<br> :date: __2021-01-16 11:16:29__

> According to covid exposure checks in settings the app did three checks between launch and November Reinstalled app in November, it hasn't carried out one single check since!<br> :date: __2021-03-24 03:50:19__
