### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I cannot receive any of the letters that I am informed Mk hospital patient portal need to send to me.??why not just send as a normal text message that don't need a code to open?<br> :date: __2021-01-02 16:23:45__

> Very useful for repeat prescriptions and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:38:00__

> Helping NHS to get better, faster at Giving a good service<br> :date: __2021-01-02 01:00:03__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-01 15:09:17__

> Brilliant app but all prescription items whether repeat or not should be available to order via the app - they're all monitored by the surgery regardless of the means to order them. Also should be a means for us to message the drs instead of having to log onto the website. Really helpful having the remote access and I sincerely hope this continues after this pandemic<br> :date: __2020-12-28 12:00:36__

> There one problem with trying register with this the photo ID proof has to be a driving licence or passport and for those that don't have one these it become difficult indeed.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 01:30:11__

> Useful app<br> :date: __2020-12-23 12:39:05__

> Followed advice & deleted 2 older apps to free up storage. Tried again. It is still in a "Pending" status. All my other apps work, the only one trying to update is NHS. It's NHS update Got a recommendation to upgrade the app but all you see is the "washing machine" going round, and round, and round..... still in a pending state and you cannot go back and use the previous version. Wanted to check a medical appointment but now can't. Does not look like this upgrade release has been fully tested!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:47:56__

> Needs more details Why I can't see my health records like blood test results or scan results or even what is the problem that I suffer Please put that in the App That's right of our rights as patients,<br> :date: __2020-12-18 12:33:42__

> I have not used it much yet don't know how good it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:40:41__

> Generally the app is very good but I've found one "flaw" and one bug Bug: If you try to re-enable fingerprint access, after it has apparently been turned off due to "a change" on my device, the app crashes as soon as I slide the "enable fingerprint" switch. Flaw: pressing the back button brings up the option to log out, rather than just take me back a screen as is more normal. Fix is to reinstall the app. Samsung S7 edge.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:53:09__

> Finally let me log in but no records, repeat prescriptions or anything show. I can't book a GP appointment. My GP records don't show my personal changes in records.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 16:39:50__

> Is there an NHS app for Scotland. I tried to register using the app but it does not recognise the information because I reside in Scotland not England.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 15:24:06__

> Not used yet<br> :date: __2020-12-10 12:24:17__

> Having trouble verifing my I. D, try to take a video but it takes me to files not video. Already messaged about this but none of advice worked. Very frustrating as it also kicks me off the site so have to log back in all the time.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 17:31:23__

> Can't get past photo upload<br> :date: __2021-01-03 11:45:49__

> Not working on my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-31 01:25:35__

> The app crashes every time I try to see my full medical history. I've tried resetting the app and still having problems.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 14:57:31__

> The consultation form asks like 50 unrelevant questions before you can actually submit consultation form. This app was much better when I used it few months ago.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 21:48:56__

> Cannot find out how to order repeat prescription<br> :date: __2020-12-16 18:59:17__

> After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. The restoration of normal service was a pain in the ass & only possible by re registration on my chosen chemist's website. It seems to have begun, though its not confirmed. As an interim, prescriptions will be delivered to a chemist shop nearer my home. Why mess about like this!?? Is the app or NHS at fault?<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:29:00__

> Currently refuses to open on my device. Sits on the opening screen with the round 'loading' thing going and just doesn't open. Please sort it out.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 14:59:51__

> System online for GP surgeries is more effective and easier to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 11:03:34__

> Still can't book appointmemts<br> :date: __2020-12-11 07:53:30__

> Trying to prove my identity with this app was a nightmare. Whenever I got to the point to upload an image, for sending photo id, to take a photo or upload a video, nothing happened when i tapped the camera icon! Seems certain random aspects of things on PHE/NHS apps don't seem to work on a Huawei P20! In the end i had to complete the registration process using an old SAMSUNG phone! BEyond that, everything seems fine.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 14:45:05__

> Terrible do not use files info can be used<br> :date: __2021-01-02 19:41:48__

> I've spent more than an hour trying to get this app to work. As others have reported it is impossible to take a photo of one's face or record a video of one's face. A complete waste of time. Dreadfull.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 15:57:09__

> Need too buy a new phone - inop on A5<br> :date: __2021-01-02 14:40:06__

> Not user friendly<br> :date: __2021-01-01 16:29:24__

> Asked local surgery for required information. (Account ID, ODS and Linkage Key). Surgery manager said they had no idea what these numbers were and couldn't give me any details.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 15:14:39__

> Terrible app it keeps freezing.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 12:21:35__

> Apparently my face isn't mine. The process to upload photo and video and external enter the personal details including nhs no is so long winded that I'm not sure I can be bothered to try again!<br> :date: __2020-12-31 20:26:13__

> Absolute pants!! Can't open camcorder to record the video required to complete registration. Very frustrating!!! After receiving a reply, thankyou very much, neither myself nor my husband can solve the issue! Therefore sadly l had to uninstall the app. Will try again next month in the hope it will work.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 15:00:35__

> Clunky and hard to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 12:04:41__

> What a Complete waste of time. You spend 20mins adding every known detail you have on the website only to be told you don't exist. So you will have to visit your Dr who will ask yet more questions. Then, you have to go back to this rubbish and try it all again. Except it does the same bloody thing again. Then you discover it's linked to the "patient access service". Well now I know why it's so totally useless.... Their response to this review will be the same one they paste for all poor reviews.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 23:34:58__
