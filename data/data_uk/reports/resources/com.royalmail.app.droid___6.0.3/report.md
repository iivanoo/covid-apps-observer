## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very good app.clear and well updated<br> :date: __2020-12-30 13:01:14__

> Excellent app easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-18 15:14:40__

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__

> If you face any problems you can't open it just change your phone's language<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:39:13__

> Very good 😊. I think.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 07:46:14__

> Tracking nos are alpha-num and long and I can't copy from my sources. Info seems sketchy. Update... uninstalled as won't accept my password, LIKE SO MANY APPS IT JUST DEFEATS ITSELF. Bah humbug.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 13:09:29__

> Unresponsive<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:30:00__

> My first experience started well, BUT I'd arranged for a parcel to be collected, got the notification confirming tracking ID, & specific day of collection by my USUAL POSTIE. However when the postie turned up, (luckily he had to ring the doorbell as he was also delivering a parcel) he knew nothing about the collection as nothing was logged on his PDA & he couldn't therefore scan it to track. He did however agree to take it & assured me it would be scanned back at the depot. We'll see 🤞<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:46:59__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> A lot of registration effort for nothing you can't do via their website<br> :date: __2021-01-02 12:25:56__

> This is the results of privatisation in app form. Doesn't even do the basics.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 16:01:07__

> I installed the app to get an update as to when my delivery would occur. I dont understand why the service is "deliver by 9pm" but you have no tracking ability. It's no wonder why services like heroes are used, as they let you know when they are an hour away, estimated delivery time. I wouldnt use the Royal mail if I have any choice, customers value the ability to know when the parcel will arrive, even if that's a 3 hour time slot.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:04:12__

> Desk top version much better. Why does this app insist on first name and surname when I am sending to a business?<br> :date: __2020-12-23 12:25:28__

> Pretty rubbish. The QR code takes you to the all, nothing else. You then need to sign up or log in and basically type all of the details from your "Something for you" card. Only then to find out you can't book a next day delivery but you can collect tomorrow. Like I said, it's pretty useless.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 13:39:50__

> The registration process uses "opt out" for marketing preferences. And tracking of a special delivery just says "out for delivery" Both show just how archaic Royal Mail is. 1st class stamp prices always going up but can't do anything modern nearly as effectively as competition<br> :date: __2020-12-22 11:26:14__

> Rubbish takes far too long to update, they don't deliver on the day that they said that they would.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 03:49:45__

> Poor app. Better just to use the website. The QR code just directs you to the app, I expected it to be a unique, secure and handy way to redeliver but no. I don't trust this app either. You can type anything and it will go through without error - random name, random address, made up delivery number. Means if you make a mistake inadvertently your redelivery will be delayed.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 11:59:14__

> I keep getting notifications saying parcels delivered when I haven't. Finding it irritating now.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:59:31__

> A tracking app that doesn't track, pointless<br> :date: __2020-12-15 19:18:45__

> Useless No real time. Parcels are arriving hours sometimes days after the suggested time given by royal mail.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 20:52:10__

> Forced login<br> :date: __2021-01-02 02:57:13__

> absolutely terrible app it cant even tell me when my package is going to arrive but will tell when i missed my delivery after they didmt come and also whenever i scan my qr code it just brings me back to the app<br> :date: __2021-01-01 12:26:50__

> Useless tracking. Very vague. No information. Just telling me stuff I already know. "We have it" ect. Useless. Use the website. It's not much better. But it is slightly more information<br> :date: __2020-12-31 14:03:14__

> Have to register to find a post box LOL no thanks<br> :date: __2020-12-31 13:30:27__

> Made by clowns<br> :date: __2020-12-31 04:39:05__

> Absolutely rubbish. Hasn't tracked one parcel yet. I'm uninstalling it<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:33:52__

> I am notified that I have a missed delivery and sent to this app. I then have to type in information from the card left at my house. But I am away on holiday and don't have the card! This is ridiculous. If the system notifies me then why cannot the system populate the app so that I can arrange redelivery when away from home.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 17:15:08__

> worst service everrr! There is no customer service and if I try to call you I wait for more than half an hour then you cut the call. Also, I did choose a safe place and let the door open but what happened infuriated me! I was inside the house just didn't hear him, The delivery man entered and left a note not the parcel! Just whyyyy! Just leave the goddammit parcel! I am soooo furious right now some of the items in the parcel needed for my son's birthday tomorrow what will I do now 🤬😡😡😡<br> :date: __2020-12-29 12:37:58__

> useless. service charged me and then not available anywhere. And no automatic refund system.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 18:01:02__
