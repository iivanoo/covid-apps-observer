## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app thank you Royal Mail!<br> :date: __2020-12-03 10:00:38__

> Only ever used the app for tracking but see it does do much more. I was struggling with deleting past delivered items. Contacted support and two days later I had a remedy. Simply involve swiping right and tapping the delete that appears. Swift help.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 18:53:39__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__

> If you face any problems you can't open it just change your phone's language<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:39:13__

> Very good ðŸ˜Š. I think.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 07:46:14__

> Easy to arrange re-delivery of parcels.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:07:07__

> Well I used app for a redelivery and still waiting for parcel, its 20 past 6, I live in hope. Other than that app seems to be working ok.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 19:18:29__

> Last few times I've re booked delivery.they havent arrived and had to re book again.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 14:49:54__

> works fine<br> :date: __2020-10-04 15:07:40__

> Well I haven't received any thing from you bar letters but I think the post office and the postie's ARE EXCELLENT<br> :date: __2020-10-03 14:57:01__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> No collection service option. Was expecting to purchase my postage and select a collection in one simple app. But no, the new parcel collection service doesn't seem to be available as it is on the desktop site. Very disappointing as their competitors make it so easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 21:57:33__

> Don't like the fact that they upsell their more expensive delivery options. By default, on packages, the standard 1st and 2nd class options are hidden by default - you have to specifically tick a box to show them as options. There's then a jumbled mess of 6 or 7 postage methods. All very confusing!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:43:53__

> In a word, clunky. The app needs to automatically populate the sender address and store card details for payment. It's really slow to use having to enter this info for every item I send. I'm logged in so should not need to re-enter this info.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:44:36__

> Can no longer rename tracked items after last update.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 13:45:17__

> Alerts for signed for parcels cone in 24hrs after delivery, doesn't help if yo don't get a card to tell you it's at a neighbours<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:09:31__

> Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish<br> :date: __2020-11-24 16:56:31__

> Primative at best. Very far behind in the tracking area compared to other tracking apps.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 03:27:27__

> Really good idea but be so careful when printing out labels.....the app tends to hold onto the last label bought so you may end up sending the item to the wrong person as I did<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:38:40__

> I have received text messages from you saying that my parcel is due today at a certain time, and it's showing me that it has been delivered today, but i don't have any parcel, so can someone tell me what is going on with my parcel please, thanks. Mr. Edmond Cairns. EH65EW<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:27:13__

> No tracking updates, no option to saved details, no copy and paste option.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:00:55__

> Keeps saying error messages when performing basic functions. Uninstall!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 11:50:51__

> I was expecting a delivery i needed it before 6 December the supplier sent it via royal mail 28 November and thats the last time its whereabouts are known - Xmas presents for my 2 grandsons ruined 1 is in RAF and I am away now until the new year to say I am angry and upset is an understatement and if I could mark this review of ROYAL MAIL LOWER I WOULD<br> :date: __2020-12-13 15:25:56__

> what hopeless developer designed this? why put a QR code on the card if all it does is open the app downloaded? utterly useless waste of my time. postman should have just knocked on the door properly in the first place. time wasters.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:24:02__

> Absolutely shocking that an app of this quality has been released by Royal Mail. This would fail as a GCSE Computing project, it is that bad. Update a month later - I am still finding new ways this app is fundamentally broken. Royal Mail should be ashamed of themselves.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 17:06:47__

> Had a time and delivery. 30 hrs later still parcel. What happened<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:57:57__

> Useless<br> :date: __2020-12-12 09:57:19__

> Royal mail are the worst delivery/postal service in the country! Way behind hermes dpd and all the rest.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 01:32:04__

> Absolute rubbish, been trying to get the app for ages, don't bother<br> :date: __2020-12-11 18:39:34__

> Just another app trying to force users to accept more annoying and unwanted adverts. As if there isn't more than enough of this rubbish being forced on us already.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 08:46:18__

> I create an account, but I can't log in, it says password is wrong, I changed password still same problem.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 21:20:28__

> Downloaded the app to try track a parcel or find a way to speak to an actual human not a voice guided system that doesn't have the correct options, nothing available. The website is also useless and their call center is even worse.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 13:48:43__
