## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellent app easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-18 15:14:40__

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__

> If you face any problems you can't open it just change your phone's language<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:39:13__

> Very good ðŸ˜Š. I think.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 07:46:14__

> Easy to arrange re-delivery of parcels.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:07:07__

> Well I used app for a redelivery and still waiting for parcel, its 20 past 6, I live in hope. Other than that app seems to be working ok.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 19:18:29__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> App worked well. This is a comment on service App actually worked well. Dont need app but web logon out of date. I thought the 2 or 3 days delay was so that parcel could be delivered with normal post. Today a royal mail van went down road. Nope not mine. Tracking says 9.30 AM received somewhere, delivery by 9 PM. Tracking not updated all day. No indication . 21.43 still no parcel. I should have gone out for dinner but stayed in for parcel. So annoyed. I think RM has outsourced without thought<br> :date: __2020-12-18 22:46:06__

> Poor app. Better just to use the website. The QR code just directs you to the app, I expected it to be a unique, secure and handy way to redeliver but no. I don't trust this app either. You can type anything and it will go through without error - random name, random address, made up delivery number. Means if you make a mistake inadvertently your redelivery will be delayed.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 11:59:14__

> I keep getting notifications saying parcels delivered when I haven't. Finding it irritating now.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:59:31__

> A tracking app that doesn't track, pointless<br> :date: __2020-12-15 19:18:45__

> All I wanted to do is use the Parcelbox finder. But no, you have to register, putting all your details in - and there's not even a postcode search function for your address. You shouldn't have to register unless you want to actually buy something.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 12:07:49__

> Don't like the fact that they upsell their more expensive delivery options. By default, on packages, the standard 1st and 2nd class options are hidden by default - you have to specifically tick a box to show them as options. There's then a jumbled mess of 6 or 7 postage methods. All very confusing!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:43:53__

> In a word, clunky. The app needs to automatically populate the sender address and store card details for payment. It's really slow to use having to enter this info for every item I send. I'm logged in so should not need to re-enter this info.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:44:36__

> Can no longer rename tracked items after last update.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 13:45:17__

> Alerts for signed for parcels cone in 24hrs after delivery, doesn't help if yo don't get a card to tell you it's at a neighbours<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:09:31__

> Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish<br> :date: __2020-11-24 16:56:31__

> Doesn't allow my email address<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:47:53__

> Downloaded only to lookup post codes but found that I had register just to do that and no doubt then get bombarded by junk mail. Removed<br> :date: __2020-12-19 15:20:36__

> The tracking does not work<br> :date: __2020-12-19 14:01:22__

> Royal mail is pure $h!te<br> :date: __2020-12-19 13:46:46__

> Installed it, and like every other Royal Mail operation it is slow and clunky. My advice is to forget about the Royal Mail and use Hermes. A much better service.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 12:48:26__

> Limited options. To update a safe place the app forces 7ser to choose alternative delivery date. Not easy to use and when opened from email, locks the screen and won't close.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 08:16:09__

> Won't install<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:39:37__

> Tried to book a collection. Got all the way to payment a couple of times but then it kept cancelling<br> :date: __2020-12-18 13:30:54__

> Utter rubbish<br> :date: __2020-12-18 08:55:02__

> Waste of time, tracking tells you nothing until item has been delivered. No wonder prices keep going up if Royal Mail waste their money on this trash.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:44:54__
