### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.

<br>View your health record

<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Really Good<br> :date: __2021-03-12 17:25:05__

> All installed fine and everything was going well until I had to prove my I.D. I press the open camera button but it doesn't work. I used a photo from file but then I need to video myself saying 4 numbers, the camera doesn't open so I can't get anywhere with that. Answered the three questions using info from GP surgery and it logged on fine. Now it is all sorted the app is easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 13:37:50__

> Easy to use. Process to register is a bit long, but it has to be secure. No problems with that.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 12:17:03__

> It keeps getting better<br> :date: __2021-03-11 22:07:15__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-03-11 16:54:09__

> Did what I needed it to do, no issues. Happy to use as don't get the 3rd degree from GP receptionist<br> :date: __2021-03-10 23:54:00__

> Does what is needed<br> :date: __2021-03-10 18:09:43__

> Was a bit tricky to initially get set up but now I have I love it. Makes my life so much easier.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 09:08:59__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:44:15__

> Missing a simple comments box!<br> :date: __2021-03-10 16:17:00__

> Pretty straight forward & good to see NHS embrace technology to manage resources<br> :date: __2021-03-10 10:25:33__

> All of my medical information and appointments in one place. Could do with adding contact details for hospitals. It was previously available now I have to look them up on-line.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 21:07:28__

> I find this app soooo useful as someone with chronic illness and I have a lot of appointments and prescriptions. My only irk is that pressing your phones back button closes the app so so have to use the in-app back button which is annoyingly hard to remember to do.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 19:34:08__

> Ordering repeat prescriptions and booking appointments is far easier through the NHS App, than having to be on hold when calling the surgery by phone. I also find the health advice a good option too. It can point you in the right direction for treatment. I find the NHS App very helpful and useful.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 18:54:51__

> Much easier to use than Patient Access plus you can add other personal information too.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:41:15__

> A bit clunky but it does actually do what you would expect it to do. For example, you can see your test results in detail and ordering a repeat prescription is easy.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:13:41__

> I was surprised it worked! Was shocked when the scanning confirmed my identity! Just for those two features it deserves a good review. One day my GP will stop asking me to fax letters to them.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 23:17:43__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

> It's a great app, except I cant seem to access any services, ask for advice or make any appointments with my GP, the service is always unavailable.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 15:45:48__

> Exceeding difficult to load identity and no ability to save and return later<br> :date: __2021-03-07 20:29:33__

> Doesn't work. I tried to register with all my details and it said something went wrong due to technical issues, so I tried to register with my nhs number and again got the technical issue message. *Edit - The app once into it works just fine. However the details you can see are restricted. I requested my surgery release the details so I can see full details about my medical history etc and they say they can't do that. Appointment can be made easily though.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 13:00:15__

> There are too many apps. Patient Access, my hospital app (MyCare), my GP booking system e-consult and this one. It means the information is fragmented and not all in one place. Very frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 11:25:54__

> My husband and I both have the app. His shows "Consultations and Events" including the fact that he has had one vaccination but mine does not have this option. How can I get this?<br> :date: __2021-03-05 18:14:31__

> Finally able to register on my tablet by using URL supplied by support. The now registered app works on my phone using the same credentials. Note that the Airmid app still works fine and allows notes to be edited into your medical record.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 11:51:32__

> So I have the app and can see my meds and allergies, but not my medical records. The GP has given me two codes - one an "ODS" code (?) but I'm blowed if I can see where to enter them. Help! I've sought and obtained my GP's permission to accesss my records and had an email from them to confirm, but nothing has changed on the app. What do I do now?<br> :date: __2021-03-02 10:51:16__

> The back button should return to the previous page rather than prompt to log you out on any screen you press it. Would also be nice if it used the Android 10 biometric API, to allow other login types than just finger print.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 16:46:25__

> It's got better, but still run by people who REALLY don't understand CUSTOMERS. They understand 'following their view of "the rules"'. ||| So \*\*\*\*\*\** complicated with so much jargon that I couldn't even install it. Complete and utter fail. Written by civil servants?<br> :date: __2021-02-25 02:19:17__

> Very nice service<br> :date: __2021-02-23 21:29:38__

> Disappointing that you have to do all verification again when get a new device<br> :date: __2021-03-13 17:09:23__

> Can't pass the video identification, the video just won't upload, please advise.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:19:02__

> It's a very slow app and I have to login every time I open the app. I think it would be good if the app saved the login information so every time I open the app I dont need to login.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 12:37:22__

> it needs expanding by customer services now passing messages onto the relevant people in the nhs + all GP practices in uk should now sign up to online booking for GP appointments now<br> :date: __2021-03-10 11:34:48__

> Downloaded the app and went through all the registration process no problem. Got onto repeat prescription part to get a prescription but still waiting to hear whether I can have prescription that I have asked for. Would have been quicker to phone the surgery and get them. What a waste of my time going through the set up process only to find the app doesn't work ☹☹<br> :date: __2021-03-09 11:34:54__

> I thought I would be able to record my covid lateral flow tests via the app but I can't so and had to set up online account to do so. Seems limited in what it makes available .. I also though it would show my covid vaccine appointment details but nothing shows.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 15:11:06__

> Hi, I have the app on my phone for several months. I was told to upload a new version which I did and it hasn't worked since then Paul It says pop's something went wrong our end<br> :date: __2021-03-06 16:21:11__

> I try to order my repeat prescriptions on this app, but every month it tells me that it needs a review. So I have to submit paper requests. There is no text box available in the repeat prescriptions section except for the ones that are not being reviewed.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:41:13__

> The app keeps cutting off when in middle of my medical records.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 21:39:57__

> Clear as mud.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:38:25__

> I cannot pass 2 steps verification. First step (DV or Passport upload/picture) is fine but second recording video is always wrong. I've tried minimum 50 times on different phones and different selections e.g. recording spoken numbers or recording written numbers. Always message CID4013. I have no idea why it is so unrealistic hard verification - clearly face and speech recognition is not perfect. Younger and healthy members of my family have passed verification without video's face recognition. I believe NHS use different version for different types of patients.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 12:28:35__

> SHITSHOW OF A APP<br> :date: __2021-03-13 00:37:47__

> Absolutely useless as the ap cannot open the camcorder for the required voice recognition .... Waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 18:28:06__

> Impossible to set up<br> :date: __2021-03-12 18:06:09__

> Cannot install the app. No more Morrisons for me! I will go to Aldi as its just as cheap even without the NHS 10%discount.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 13:17:40__

> Hate it. Security code doesn't arrive despite full mobile reception and internet access. Wouldn't care if GP wasn"t currently making it incredibly difficult to make an appointment by phone but this app is now supposed to be how i access my GP services and I can't aceess the app. i need to book a series of tests. There's no way to get help, no way to report a problem. Terrible when this provision of a public service. Feeling disenfranchised and let down. I'd give zero stars if it was an option.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 10:07:34__

> Tried 10 times to set up. Every time I get to the upload a photo of your passport it returns me to the home page to start the whole process again. I have tried using the camera option and uploading a photo of my passport. Start back to home page login each time!<br> :date: __2021-03-11 21:23:00__

> This app is utter garbage. I have tried 14 times to set up NHS login, but it keeps bombing out and going back to the beginning. Kindly shoot the developer of this untested code.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 20:54:21__

> Face scan just kept saying no match and video record link wouldn't open video camera on my phone. So now they have my details and I can't access app.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 13:26:12__
