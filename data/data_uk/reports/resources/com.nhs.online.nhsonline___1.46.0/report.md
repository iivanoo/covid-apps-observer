### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans

<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very good<br> :date: __2021-03-18 10:22:52__

> Absolutely no issues here. The app works fine, the sign up and proving who I was worked perfectly. Love the way it links to my GP surgery to get additional info.. shame it cannot link to my Dentist as it cannot see a hospital referral they made under the NHS for me. Otherwise really impressed, good features and a very useful app if you are health conscious. Glad I found and installed it. Give it a slightly better and less clinical look and you'd have a real winner.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 06:46:19__

> A very good app if you need to get information on your medication medicall history and very good if you need to apply for personal independence payment for dwp needs a better menu but its good<br> :date: __2021-03-18 23:44:53__

> It's quick and easy to sign up and the verification took less than 10 minutes. It has a few good sources of information and NHS 111 advice integrated into the app. The fact that I can amend my nominated pharmacy, organ donation decision etc is great. I also appreciate that I can see my prescriptions and any messages. The app also has a familiar NHS website look and feel which reinforces the trust in the application and services provided. It also takes identity theft very seriously.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 23:42:56__

> I have just downloaded it today and fortunately didn't have any issues. I think the concept is good and hopefully will improve in time and as it's used more.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 12:19:46__

> Excellent level of security to set up. Simple to use once activated. Like it to arrange appointments and order prescriptions<br> :date: __2021-03-16 16:07:23__

> Often go in loops when willing in information, but generally a good app that's nice and freshly designed.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 17:36:24__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-03-15 16:58:39__

> Been mostly easy to use. Booking (covid jab) appointments though, it is just incapable of doing at the moment. Frustrating. Since you're told to not contact your surgery regarding the jab.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 11:27:13__

> I don't have any form of photo id which means I'm unable to prove who I am hence I can't use the app, how do I prove who I am without id<br> :date: __2021-03-18 23:59:51__

> Doesn't seem to include scotland<br> :date: __2021-03-18 13:27:32__

> I am unable to identify if my covid 19 Astra Zenica 2 doses has been recorded. In my medical record as I may need to use it for travel purposes..<br> :date: __2021-03-17 17:44:29__

> Needs some work. I have hospital, referral appointments in the next few months but the list of my hospital appointments don't show on the app it says 'no refferals'<br> :date: __2021-03-17 11:37:49__

> proving ID seems very very extensive hate to be such a cynic but what are the guarantees that the App is secure in itself Public Sector sourced computer progs don't have a good track record<br> :date: __2021-03-17 10:52:26__

> If I could make appointments would give it five<br> :date: __2021-03-15 08:30:41__

> It's a great app, except I cant seem to access any services, ask for advice or make any appointments with my GP, the service is always unavailable.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 15:45:48__

> It's a very slow app and I have to login every time I open the app. I think it would be good if the app saved the login information so every time I open the app I dont need to login.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 12:37:22__

> it needs expanding by customer services now passing messages onto the relevant people in the nhs + all GP practices in uk should now sign up to online booking for GP appointments now<br> :date: __2021-03-10 11:34:48__

> Downloaded the app and went through all the registration process no problem. Got onto repeat prescription part to get a prescription but still waiting to hear whether I can have prescription that I have asked for. Would have been quicker to phone the surgery and get them. What a waste of my time going through the set up process only to find the app doesn't work ☹☹<br> :date: __2021-03-09 11:34:54__

> I thought I would be able to record my covid lateral flow tests via the app but I can't so and had to set up online account to do so. Seems limited in what it makes available .. I also though it would show my covid vaccine appointment details but nothing shows.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 15:11:06__

> Hi, I have the app on my phone for several months. I was told to upload a new version which I did and it hasn't worked since then Paul It says pop's something went wrong our end<br> :date: __2021-03-06 16:21:11__

> I try to order my repeat prescriptions on this app, but every month it tells me that it needs a review. So I have to submit paper requests. There is no text box available in the repeat prescriptions section except for the ones that are not being reviewed.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:41:13__
