## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So far so good, however,there should be a way to delete parcels once you've received them.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 12:47:22__

> I would like it if the app could save addresses that I frequently use.<br> :date: __2021-03-27 14:52:11__

> There is no option to delete tracking numbers on the tracking tab. The app need a feature where the user can delete individual or all track history!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 15:35:12__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-02-17 11:33:01__

> No matter how many updates this app has, it still doesn't work, crashes upon opening everytime. I have been unable to use the app since February 2020 on a Sony Xperia XA1. Sort it out Royal Mail. Update, 13 Feb 2021 decided to try this app again and installed it again, it now works, opens, can login, and view my saved tracking numbers. Let's see how long it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:14:54__

> OK..<br> :date: __2021-02-09 20:35:17__

> Ok<br> :date: __2021-02-01 14:04:05__

> Improving thanks<br> :date: __2021-01-23 21:31:53__

> It's not a bad app for tracking parcels. Just would really like to be able to delete them from my list once they've been delivered. Any chance?<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:25:38__

> World's be useful if it allowed you to delete previous tracked items<br> :date: __2021-01-12 10:14:01__

> It says there's an error try again at the end of redelivery after putting your details in<br> :date: __2021-03-30 10:25:00__

> Normally a fantastic app. But all it seems to be doing is crashing ATM<br> :date: __2021-03-23 09:03:44__

> Will not let me do change of address or any other services.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:46:46__

> Claims tubes that meet medium parcel dimensions are too big.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:00:00__

> Everytime I go on the app my session has expired and have to log in quite frustrating<br> :date: __2021-02-08 08:48:09__

> I use primarily for tracking incoming and outgoing parcels. Cannot edit description when inputting data which leaves me with columns of meaningless numbers until I am eventually allowed to manually edit once RM have clocked the item in system which is very slow and tedious. Unedited numbers are also duplicated in list and shuffled around making even more work! And whatever happened to push notifications? More and more I am having to use third party apps to help with tracking and sanity. 🚛🆘☯️<br> :date: __2021-02-07 15:31:01__

> When you click on a URL to the tracking number on another app suck as a email, it directs to this app instead of a web page which would be great but it doesn't phase the URL and extract the tracking number then take you directly there.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:34:29__

> Tracking Don't Update most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:07:13__

> Sorry, an error occurred, can't install it, done the redelivery through site, just uninstalled.....<br> :date: __2021-01-18 19:42:45__

> Dates incorrectly read as US. Your item was delivered 01 August 2021... When it was delivered 20210108, not 20210801....<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:24:06__

> login accepted on website but fails on app ... get this fixed please<br> :date: __2021-04-03 22:18:16__

> Unfortunately when you book more than one pick up, the post man shows up and says he can only see one item for the day. This is useless. He refuses to take the extra parcels, which means I have to walk down to the customer service centre and drop them off. This is wrong in all honesty.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 18:45:09__

> This app is complicated and doesn't even include our local Delivery Office. You cant move your location without first having a post code for somewhere else. It claims that the local post office within our Coop is open until 10pm! It is helpful to confirm information you already have but not to find out anything new. I haven't tried sending a parcel via it, maybe it works well for that<br> :date: __2021-04-03 11:07:57__

> Navigation is poor, and it infuriates me that the developers blame the users' 'weak' internet connection for their own network failures. Funny how no other app or browser has a problem connecting.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 00:53:37__

> Used this app twice now to buy postage and both tines had to input info numerous times then when ptint your label at home constant error messages, it will allow me to pront a qr click and drop A4 label but that's not what I want so now I have to drive 10+ miles to the nearest mail drop office. I will be removing the RM option from my selling site.<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:21:07__

> App won't open. comes up with a notification saying that it's unable to open and I'm left to tap either app info, close app or send feedback. If I tap send feedback it tells me my phone isn't connected to a data service. Seems a lot of hassle to report a problem 😕<br> :date: __2021-03-15 09:17:09__

> Useful to store your sending history, that's about it. No way to save my details or edit addresses, and I can't use card info saved to my phone when paying for postage. Even hermes can do better...<br> :date: __2021-03-11 02:21:32__

> So much room for improvement. I have to enter all my details every time I use the app, why can't it remember my name and address???? A list of favourite destination addresses would save loads of time as well. Tracking means where is it now, not we'll tell you after we have tried to deliver!! Also, why not attach the label to the email I receive to save me having to fiddle about downloading the label from the app before I can print it? Come on Royal Mail, a few teaks would make this a genuine alternative to your competitors.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 13:09:13__

> Good to track your delivery but changing deliveries to another location its useless. I update 2 deliveries for other location (post office) and when i got home i got the something for you card... don't make sense!<br> :date: __2021-02-19 12:23:27__

> It won't even let me print the label I've paid for<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:36:11__

> Keeps crashing after latest update! Useless<br> :date: __2021-04-03 18:56:49__

> People at Royal Mail really need to work on their handwriting.<br> :date: __2021-04-03 15:55:04__

> Keeps crashing and cannot book redelivery<br> :date: __2021-04-02 13:46:04__

> Saying online open ,but place closed, not put reference no. On card and app saying redelivery not working on the app doesn't sound help being bank holiday but redeliver on Tuesday which is no good when I finish at 5 all week so just miss it again soon be amazon mail not royal mail more convenient and deliver late etc, so all good 🤣<br> :date: __2021-04-02 11:50:46__

> Horrible app. By default it chooses redeliver when trying to add a safe place!! Tried to add a safe place and it changed my delivery date by 5 days!!!<br> :date: __2021-04-02 09:05:52__

> Don't even bother!! Typical Royal mail.....nothing works properly!!!!!!<br> :date: __2021-04-01 19:03:37__

> Rubbish. Every time I scan the qr code on the slip shoved through my door it returns me to the install app option. No settings in the app for scanning qr. Pointless<br> :date: __2021-04-01 15:09:41__

> Not flexible on passwords so you have to make something unique to these guys<br> :date: __2021-03-31 13:09:34__

> Tried to book a redelivery just said error at the end. Went via the website that worked. How can you get away producing an app that doesn't work. I suppose it's free but I'm uninstalling as it is of no use so why spend the money making it?<br> :date: __2021-03-31 12:28:15__

> Utterly broken. I can't even sign up.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 01:17:41__
