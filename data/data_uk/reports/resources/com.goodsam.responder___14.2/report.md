> The GoodSAM Responder App is a professional deployment system used by Emergency Services around the world.
<br>GoodSAM provides a range of solutions connecting those with specific skill sets to those in need, for example:
<br>-       GoodSAM Cardiac – This system is used by ambulance services to alert those trained in resuscitation (e.g. off duty paramedics, nurses, doctors, police and fire staff) to those nearby who are likely to be in cardiac arrest. This system has saved many lives around the world.
<br>-       GoodSAM Volunteer Response – GoodSAM is a platform used by organisations such as the Royal Voluntary Service and British Red Cross.
<br>-       GoodSAM Pro – This is a professional dispatch system for community first responders and the emergency services.
<br>The App utilises the latest in location technology and has many advanced features including a built in “radio” (Buzz) function so you can communicate with surrounding colleagues.
<br>The GoodSAM platform has saved hundreds of lives and helped many thousands of people around the world. If you can help your community, please download the App and register under your parent organisation (or get your parent organisation on board if they are not on!).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | GoodSAM LTD |
| **Website**  | [http://www.goodsamapp.org/](http://www.goodsamapp.org/) |
| **Email** | info@goodsamapp.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I've registered to volunteer at vaccination sites, received an email saying that they have noticed I hadn't taken up any opportunity, well that's because I haven't received any! Still receiving check in and chat and community response but nothing else.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 19:54:30__

> Please allow filtering of future tasks by day<br> :date: __2021-05-04 11:55:54__

> Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 06:05:24__

> Since the update, this is a good app. I still haven't had a volunteering alert for the vaccination centres yet, here's hoping!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:01:46__

> Seems to run well. Had no alerts yet since registering<br> :date: __2021-02-26 05:17:37__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> The app works ok most of the time. One problem I get is the location side, I've had to reject quite a few alerts that have been 12 miles away even though my app is set at 5 miles.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:57:46__

> The App need an audible alert when scheduled tasks appear. I have missed opportunities to volunteer due to this. Steve. NHS/RVS Volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:16:50__

> The issue I had experienced has been resolved. Now, the app is up and running on my phone as it should. Thank you 👍<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:06:29__

> Good Idea. But after 814 hours on duty there is no task.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:01:12__

> Cant find a decent burger .... ppppfffffff<br> :date: __2021-03-12 14:29:29__

> Have not received actual work in months. Lots of alerts about people safeguarding but when called no action required. Also I'm supposed to be a driver but haven't seen a driver call since I initially registered.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:26:17__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:50:54__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2021-01-29 09:28:59__

> The app tells me my certificate/ID is out of date but when I log onto the website it states it's valid until next year. Please help!<br> :date: __2021-01-29 07:30:57__

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> Can the app not give basic details on the alert as hard to know if can adequately deal with the situation? Also I assume the alert goes to everyone locally until someone responds...I hope so as I didn't get sound on notification so no idea what time it came through?<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:50:50__

> This app work fine on my phone, but my husband cannot get it to work on his Galaxy Alpha. The screen displays 'please log in' but there is nowhere to do so, and you cannot exit from the app. He really wants to volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 11:00:36__

> I have just been cleared and invited to join. I have lost my password and unable to retrieve it. What should I do?<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:09:30__

> Tried to register right now. Filled in my details and upon pressing the register button got the notification: "Couldn't send the registration link to the email provided. Is the email correct?" Yes, it is correct, because I used the "Passwort forgotten" button that send me a resetting link to the same email. Now I can't go through registration, since the registration link never reached my inbox but apparently the email did, because "this email is in use". 🙄 Will give more stars later.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 07:04:09__

> Registered to be a responder last year, still awaiting acceptance<br> :date: __2021-05-06 18:02:57__

> The notification alerts are limited to: 1.embarrasingly loud & protracted. 2. irritating as hell 3. difficult to hear The app itself works reasonably well but, having tried everything I can think of, I simply can't get it to remember my password I.e. no apparent option including via phone settings. All other apps give option to retain on installation. Tiresome logging in, therefore, which at times can be for remorseless alerts for assistance throughout the day. So, very poorly designed.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 09:01:42__

> Unable to use the app and therefore unable to continue currently as a volunteer.. The app fails when I click the "future tasks" tab. All other tabs work. The app worked on my previous Motorola G6, but does not work on my existing Motorola G6. Have been installing and uninstalling the app for the past 3 days, since I started using my new phone. Help, please. Thanks!<br> :date: __2021-04-13 12:42:01__

> Poor<br> :date: __2021-02-19 18:51:16__

> Attempted to register as a registered responder and 4 weeks later still waiting for it to be reviewed/approved. Nil other way to contact them.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 02:32:18__

> I've been logged in for over 1000 hours and never had a notification, even though I have all notification settings turned on. I've just gone into messages to find loads saying I've not responded to a request. How can I respond if the app isn't notifying me?<br> :date: __2021-03-28 09:16:49__

> Load of rubbish. Was told by emergency Doctor from other side of my Borough to sign up to get a volunteer to collect my prescription. App wouldn't even let me state I was in the UK when registering. Tried several times. Give up. Response to developers: I was told to register by a gp to find a volunteer to collect a prescription/medication last night The App would not let me put the UK as my country! I am already registered with NHS First Responders. I get a call every couple of weeks.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 11:43:35__
