### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. For vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community.
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus.
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features:
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district.
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test.
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app.
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

When fixed will change rating.<br> :date: __2021-06-27 09:34:46__

> Where is the access for people living in Wales? It should be live..<br> :date: __2021-06-26 11:54:44__

> Seems to work well WHEN codes are displayed on the doors of shops, cafes, restaurants/bars/pubs. So probably a good idea to keep it going. Please ensure more facilities subscribe to the message x<br> :date: __2021-06-25 14:14:43__

> Got a notification of being in distance of a positive covid person but it doesn't tell me when and where so how can I ensure I tell the people who I've been in contact with and why did I get it but not my fiance who has been in the same places? Bit ridiculous really as no answer or online chat to confirm answers to our questions.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 12:45:23__

> need to remove on Google maps once left venue,<br> :date: __2021-06-24 17:52:23__

> Reassuring if I have to go out anywhere (though it should recognise when I'm at home, and not get stroppy about me turning it off then!) It could do with the actual information I require rather than sending me to the NHS England page to follow the rabbit hole. What I just want to know is what level of infection is in my area. A simple red/amber/green light would suffice, letting me know if it's safe to go out or not.<br> :date: __2021-06-24 09:39:22__

> Poor....will not accept my post code, IOM, even though we are being told to use this to demonstrate vacination status<br> :date: __2021-06-24 00:12:32__

> There seems to be a fundamental problem with the messaging for the use of this app, and that is that it's just as important to check out as check in. If you don't check out, then it marks that you've been there until 23.59 that day, even if you were in at 08.00 for 10mins. So if someone reports testing positive and visited the same place as you on the same day, you both may be recorded as having visited at the same time and be contacted, even if that wasn't the case! BAM. Self-Isolation.<br> :date: __2021-06-21 18:12:16__

> Doesn't work yes you can check in but it doesn't actually work to track and trace on my mobile just get an error code. Only good for checking in.<br> :date: __2021-06-25 23:30:55__

> App registers you into locations until 23:59 the day you visit so you may get an alert based on an infected person who arrived hours after you left. Two out of the only 4 people I met last Thursday forced to isolate, surely should have been all or none? All double jabbed and none tested positive yet BTW...<br> :date: __2021-06-21 23:30:19__

> Most of the app is user friendly but using Bluetooth only is a bad design. What happens with those who live in remote/rural areas; how will their Bluetooth connect? Why not wireless or even 3G, or would that cost another several billion pounds to implement...<br> :date: __2021-06-21 18:51:21__
