### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. For vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community.
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus.
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features:
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district.
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test.
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app.
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Freezing, I'm getting the app trying to open but shows its frozen on loading in a notification. Edit: after taking the steps carried out, the app is still putting the loading notification on the home screen at the top of my phone. I've now sent an email off as its still not fixed after the update.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 23:26:21__

> Great staff..Appointments easy enough when you can get through..just don't agree shouting your information through the intercom at the door, while other patients or public are also waiting around you. personal information should remain personal, maybe a booking in system outside whilst we're not allowed in during these times.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 10:29:33__

> Got an alert yesterday that I have been in close contact with someone with Covid but doesn't tell me where or when. This would be helpful information so I know whether to isolate just myself or others as well who may have been with me. It would also let me know if I was at the same venue at the same time as the person. If it was just the same day, not time, I wouldn't need to isolate<br> :date: __2021-06-11 10:20:02__

> Do question how accurate the 2 metre limit is. Have been told to self isolate and the only potential positive contact is a neighbour who would be more likely to be 3 metres plus away<br> :date: __2021-06-10 08:09:34__

> You can only use if you live in the UK<br> :date: __2021-06-09 17:41:13__

> Just a general question: I started going casual working and yhe company requires to take rapid covid test and record it on this app. But I can only add lateral flow test, but not the rapid test. Could someone explain this to me?<br> :date: __2021-06-07 00:09:10__

> Rubbish to many issue's registering driving license plus vedio should not need all that. Won't bother now<br> :date: __2021-06-06 21:52:46__

> After an update on 4 June the app constantly indicated "App Loading". Uninstall+re-install fixed this. However all of my location tracing has been lost.....not good<br> :date: __2021-06-06 21:20:11__

> Why doesn't the app show my vaccine status?<br> :date: __2021-06-06 11:47:13__

> doesn't work properly<br> :date: __2021-06-05 10:17:14__

> needs persistence to use!<br> :date: __2021-06-04 11:17:14__

> It worked fine at first but since turning my Bluetooth off at home I'm getting constant error messages saying it's stopped working. Tried uninstall/ reinstall and no change. Can't access the app at all now.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 20:49:46__

> It's been 'installing' for over an hour now. My battery is draining and it isn't even up and working yet<br> :date: __2021-06-11 12:24:05__

> Without legal backing there's not much point to this. My employer says they know where my ping came from and that I wasn't close enough to need to isolate...... Not risking the rath of my employer to comply the isolation request.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 11:43:43__

> My daughter has tested positive I have to isolate as I was in contact with her but yet t&t isn't showing anything total waste of Money!<br> :date: __2021-06-11 11:05:14__

> Great idea but missing so much. I was visiting my partner in hospital mat ward so need to do regular literal flow tests and was told to log the results on the app but you can't it only allows you to log positive tests! If you can scan QR codes for venues why can't this app scan the code on the test, better yet scan the code and take a picture of the negative results as proof. You can log all results on the gov website and get text confirm so the system is in place but not linked to the app why<br> :date: __2021-06-11 07:03:24__

> 4.5 rating with all these reviews??not to mention all the lies from this so called nhs app.its serco not nhs<br> :date: __2021-06-11 04:38:29__

> Did not work<br> :date: __2021-06-10 16:47:56__

> Horribly buggy, gives me notifications that mean nothing and dissapear without trace when I click on them to see what they are. And the QR code scanner only works in perfect lighting, otherwise it just has a black screen<br> :date: __2021-06-10 15:28:18__
