<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking briskly counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10's are simple to fit into your day, from taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lot of opportunities to include brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, we recommend keeping your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to BetterHealth

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Have been using it for around 6 weeks with a 30 min daily target. The 10 min blocks and weekly total help to make up if you miss the daily target. 29 July 21. Same problem as other users below. Have to go through set up every time I open it. Has this problem been fixed yet. If so, what do I do to update?<br> :date: __2021-07-29 11:03:16__

> I have to enter all the information each time I open the app. Very irritating!<br> :date: __2021-07-26 18:26:18__

> Great app that's easy to use and understand. Very helpful in keeping me on target in my old age. July 2021. What's happened? Different opening page & have to answer the same questions every time I open the app now!<br> :date: __2021-07-26 10:25:07__

> it's good would be nice to have how many steps you've done as well<br> :date: __2021-07-11 14:07:33__

> Not yet used Sent me<br> :date: __2021-06-22 17:00:51__

> Straightforward to use Good to be able to look back at previous activity<br> :date: __2021-06-19 20:26:34__

> Pity there isn't a place to list sekf-isolating or recent operations!!<br> :date: __2021-06-18 12:02:43__

> Do I really need a picture of the fat lady at startup? Please, at least allow the possibility to go directly to the next section showing minutes walked directly.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 22:32:39__

> Latest update nuked all my previous rewards.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 19:59:50__

> not pleased with the pink colour scheme and photo of lady at the start. And why the set up questions each time you open the app?<br> :date: __2021-07-27 23:48:30__

> Opened it up today and it's all changed and had to fill up questions again and all my rewards that I worked hard for has gone Why the change disappointed<br> :date: __2021-07-27 16:21:50__

> Despite the recent update, the app is making me go through set up every time I open it up. It still remembers my walk history, but it's quite annoying having to set up the permissions every time<br> :date: __2021-07-25 19:50:34__

> Disappointed with latest update...it goes through the set up every single time I use it. I've using this for several years and it keeps me motivated to do my daily power walk but fed up it goes through the set up questions every time! Using an android OnePlus5T<br> :date: __2021-07-01 18:57:14__

> Would like it if it linked to android or apple devices when not wanting to take your phone out for a walk<br> :date: __2021-06-25 00:13:14__

> Really surprised there is no settings to account for I'll be pushing a pram!!! Breathlessness will happen at slower speed.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 01:14:58__

> Generally good but does not accurately record walking times, always less than I have actually done which is annoying.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 10:41:15__

> It stopped working<br> :date: __2021-06-04 13:57:28__

> I liked this app for its simplicity and ease of use. Updated today and it has a new slower startup screen, then I had to go through the whole setup again as if I was a new user - thankfully my brisk minute history is still there but all my badges are gone. It was working fine for me before - when will this be fixed?<br> :date: __2021-07-30 16:21:29__

> New colour scheme is hideous! But even more annoyingly, every time I open the app it asks me to confirm permissions, goals etc<br> :date: __2021-07-29 17:24:03__

> Usually a great app but still waiting for a fix to prevent needing to go thru set up questions each time. Pretty annoying bug.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 12:42:36__

> Last update is very strange. The app count my usual walk as brisk walking. I'm walking fast, but not so fast as the exercise demands.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 21:30:34__

> Much preferred the older version Easier to use. Hope you can resolve the issue of having to set up app each time before use.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 13:28:50__

> Fine at measuring brisk walking, but super annoying that you have to answer 83 questions every time you open the app. Why can't you just remember my answers from last time?<br> :date: __2021-07-27 17:09:16__

> Ruined with a pointless update. I liked this because I have a health condition for which I'm advised to walk briskly for 30 mins a day and this gave me a tool to help. Now I have to go through the set up each time I use it. It's also now a dreadful colour and includes a daft picture of a random woman. Why have you done this?<br> :date: __2021-07-27 10:32:41__

> Latest update forces you to complete the set-up every time you use the app. This needs to be changed I don't need to waste my time on such stupidity<br> :date: __2021-07-15 00:22:42__

> Moved app to a new phone and it goes through the set up questions every time I open it. It also seems to under report Active steps. The old app on my old phone worked so well. Such a shame.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 00:42:00__

> Was a good app, but since the update it does not always register the walks and walks randomly go missing. Think it is time to ditch the app and look for something else.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 15:09:48__

> App was fine but latest update deleted all my badges and progress<br> :date: __2021-07-30 12:28:16__

> The last update has lost all my past data, I really liked the app until then.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 20:06:21__

> Today,29July, an update fixed some issues, but has not restored badges that we worked hard for. We used to use this every day and enjoyed having it, but these updates have made things worse.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 15:52:04__

> How to downgrade? Every time I launch the app, it starts like first time. UPD: nothing has changed!<br> :date: __2021-07-29 11:42:19__

> Lost all progress and rewards in the most recent update.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 22:41:27__

> Great overall though tracking distance covered would be good too. Since lost most of my data so now unimpressed by the app. Now it's asking me to agree to terms and conditions everytime I use it! Why? Just had to reinstall yet again.....keeps asking me questions as if new user when been using it for months! Still giving it a low mark as had to reinstall because of above problem so lost the monthly total....so now it's saying I have walked only 3 days this month when I have done eveyday.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 22:19:09__

> Just found out the app has had an update. Now have to re-enter my details every time I open the app. Awful and unusable so will not be using the app again. Now uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 20:55:12__

> Same as other users... I've lost all of my history and now have to set up from scratch each time.... Please fix it asap as I love this app - it really motivates me to get out and walk!<br> :date: __2021-07-28 11:43:20__

> Love this app but after the latest update it deleted my progress this week. It's only a couple of days but it's quite demoralising! Please look into ways of fixing this.<br> :date: __2021-07-28 09:58:13__

> Latest update lost all the badges. Not to mention needing to go through set up questions again...<br> :date: __2021-07-28 04:35:20__
