## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Was working fine. The new app however just crashes when I go to the track packages tab which was the the main reason I used the app<br> :date: __2021-05-24 18:06:01__

> Royal mail have been the main UK postal service since Time began! and have always been reliable! l don't think they have the public faith that they used to have Year's ago! but they've coped admirably during this Pandemic and most likely clawed back some of that missing public faith! Well done Royal Mail!<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:47:43__

> It is OK, but sometimes the tracking isn't updated and when booking a redelivery it says it is still pending<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:24:40__

> please sync across all device for undelivered "recorded mail" search history<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:22:04__

> was sending a valuable item to Ireland on Special Delivery guaranteed by 13:00 next day - Didn't arrive until about 14:00 the day after. Much stress involved!!! Not the service I normally expect or get!<br> :date: __2021-05-23 08:37:45__

> Useful app but it needs the ability to clearly define a safe delivery location, extra star when this feature is provided in the app<br> :date: __2021-05-22 10:54:22__

> parcels being delivered to me are not automatically visible on app unless it's tracking number is physicaly typed in other companies do this automatically<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:04:01__

> good app gives bit more clarity but could maybe do more to track a parcel<br> :date: __2021-05-21 02:51:21__

> As with most delivery apps it this relies on accurate info input. Parcels showing as 'Due for delivery on....' and then not updating even when the due date passes make these apps incredibly frustrating. This is no exception.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 03:42:07__

> It would be nice to be updated on tracked parcels. Sometimes you get updates others you cant track until its delivered.<br> :date: __2021-05-19 13:51:05__

> ok but a bit of info before delivery would be nice,, you only get information after delivery,,pretty pointless<br> :date: __2021-05-18 23:52:47__

> slow and unreliable<br> :date: __2021-05-17 17:12:41__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Why is it that with the Dominos app I can literally watch as my pizza travels along the roads but the best Royal Mail can do is narrow it down to half a day, and, it's in the town you live in?<br> :date: __2021-05-15 10:43:48__

> Not with enough info:as to redirecting parcel when tracking a parcel not helpful no telephone num:or chatline parcel far away from my home. In this NHS 2U part of this issues could only leave a short message feedback and chat useless. Had id known about parcel being dispatched and incorrect forwarding address could had acted much quicker.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 05:17:12__

> Constantly having to log back in with the app giving a pop up of my log in has expired<br> :date: __2021-05-13 09:42:23__

> Unable to confirm the status of your item We have not attempted to deliver your item yet please try again later. So it only tracks deliveries made? Sssuuuupppppeeeerrrrr useful<br> :date: __2021-05-11 19:23:54__

> PayPal payment no longer working. Logging out removes your sending history. (So you can't access labels or get proof of postage on items sent). No reply yet to my support requests by email. Have to fill in my details every time I send items.<br> :date: __2021-05-10 12:48:29__

> Can't sign up can't get my parcel redelivered no use I had to ring up a expensive phone number in order to get mail delivered the lazy post man yet again didn't ring my door bell<br> :date: __2021-05-07 23:36:05__

> postie didn't ring my buzzer, i have been in all day, not happy at all<br> :date: __2021-05-07 15:36:10__

> just had a text to say my parcel will be delivered on May 4th, which was yesterday, royal mail still the useless clowns they have always been<br> :date: __2021-05-05 11:50:31__
