## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> A little tricky to navigate, card received for a parcel but with no tracking number, nor anyway of getting feedback eg:with an online help assistant, which would be enormously useful.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 14:41:16__

> Trying to re book a delivery and when you have to confirm at the end all I get is an error message. The app is rubbish it doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:11:28__

> Tries to go through send process but everyone I tapped confirm button it would open the same page again<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:07:13__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Not with enough info:as to redirecting parcel when tracking a parcel not helpful no telephone num:or chatline parcel far away from my home. In this NHS 2U part of this issues could only leave a short message feedback and chat useless. Had id known about parcel being dispatched and incorrect forwarding address could had acted much quicker.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 05:17:12__

> Constantly having to log back in with the app giving a pop up of my log in has expired<br> :date: __2021-05-13 09:42:23__

> Unable to confirm the status of your item We have not attempted to deliver your item yet please try again later. So it only tracks deliveries made? Sssuuuupppppeeeerrrrr useful<br> :date: __2021-05-11 19:23:54__
