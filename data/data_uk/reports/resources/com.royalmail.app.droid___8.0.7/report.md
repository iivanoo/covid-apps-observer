## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Royal mail have been the main UK postal service since Time began! and have always been reliable! l don't think they have the public faith that they used to have Year's ago! but they've coped admirably during this Pandemic and most likely clawed back some of that missing public faith! Well done Royal Mail!<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:47:43__

> OK, but not live tracking like many other delivery companies.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 09:58:56__

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> It is OK, but sometimes the tracking isn't updated and when booking a redelivery it says it is still pending<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:24:40__

> please sync across all device for undelivered "recorded mail" search history<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:22:04__

> was sending a valuable item to Ireland on Special Delivery guaranteed by 13:00 next day - Didn't arrive until about 14:00 the day after. Much stress involved!!! Not the service I normally expect or get!<br> :date: __2021-05-23 08:37:45__

> Useful app but it needs the ability to clearly define a safe delivery location, extra star when this feature is provided in the app<br> :date: __2021-05-22 10:54:22__

> parcels being delivered to me are not automatically visible on app unless it's tracking number is physicaly typed in other companies do this automatically<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:04:01__

> good app gives bit more clarity but could maybe do more to track a parcel<br> :date: __2021-05-21 02:51:21__

> As with most delivery apps it this relies on accurate info input. Parcels showing as 'Due for delivery on....' and then not updating even when the due date passes make these apps incredibly frustrating. This is no exception.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 03:42:07__

> Tries to go through send process but everyone I tapped confirm button it would open the same page again<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:07:13__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Why is it that with the Dominos app I can literally watch as my pizza travels along the roads but the best Royal Mail can do is narrow it down to half a day, and, it's in the town you live in?<br> :date: __2021-05-15 10:43:48__

> Not with enough info:as to redirecting parcel when tracking a parcel not helpful no telephone num:or chatline parcel far away from my home. In this NHS 2U part of this issues could only leave a short message feedback and chat useless. Had id known about parcel being dispatched and incorrect forwarding address could had acted much quicker.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 05:17:12__

> Constantly having to log back in with the app giving a pop up of my log in has expired<br> :date: __2021-05-13 09:42:23__

> Unable to confirm the status of your item We have not attempted to deliver your item yet please try again later. So it only tracks deliveries made? Sssuuuupppppeeeerrrrr useful<br> :date: __2021-05-11 19:23:54__

> PayPal payment no longer working. Logging out removes your sending history. (So you can't access labels or get proof of postage on items sent). No reply yet to my support requests by email. Have to fill in my details every time I send items.<br> :date: __2021-05-10 12:48:29__

> Can't sign up can't get my parcel redelivered no use I had to ring up a expensive phone number in order to get mail delivered the lazy post man yet again didn't ring my door bell<br> :date: __2021-05-07 23:36:05__

> postie didn't ring my buzzer, i have been in all day, not happy at all<br> :date: __2021-05-07 15:36:10__

> hate wasting time‼️ they leave you many hours between potential delivery, so have you waiting in alllll day, to just not show up and claim they couldn't get access to the property for an already redelivery. so annoyed with this service, ruined my entire day. wish me luck someone with a brain tries to re re deliver today<br> :date: __2021-06-10 08:13:51__

> 0/5 Stars Long running customer this app is NO LONGER WORKING. A week ago they apologised said they had trouble a couple of days. Today same thing. Put all details in (as I have for ages) paid.... unable to print. Now I will have to wait 7-10 days for a refund (I haven't received any refund for the 2 parcels last week. until this is fixed. DO NOT USE... OR AT LEAST DO NOT RELY ON IT WORKING.<br> :date: __2021-06-09 20:24:13__

> lost my parcel and don't seem v bothered to be honest .foundcustomer care incompetent and uncaring<br> :date: __2021-06-08 19:55:54__

> I can't get the app to print at home so I have to go to a delivery office to get them to print it, but they're shut most of the time. Amazingly this has actually made the time consuming process of sending a letter....even more time consuming!<br> :date: __2021-06-08 16:39:22__

> Tried to install the app on Samsung Edge but got a message saying my mobile wssn't compatible, What does this mean? Do I need a brick mobile to be sccepted? poor show Royal Mai. Now I just track via the website<br> :date: __2021-06-08 00:42:52__

> Royal Mail very often do not deliver the package but seem happy to lie by claiming they have. This very unprofessional and unethical action has left me out of pocket on more than one occasion. I now do my best to avoid buying anything that is being delivered by Royal Mail.<br> :date: __2021-06-07 19:56:50__
