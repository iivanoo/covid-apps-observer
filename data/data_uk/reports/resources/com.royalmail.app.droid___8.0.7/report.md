## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:18:18__

> room for improvement but, highly useful<br> :date: __2021-06-26 10:51:14__

> Great! Gives all info and enables you to add preferences. Only issue is no redelivery history, and no option to add picture of alternative safe drop-off space. Cheerrss<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:12:07__

> No alternate delivery instructions permitted<br> :date: __2021-06-15 19:28:08__

> Keeps saying sorry you've logged out on start up. Just simply ask for log in<br> :date: __2021-06-15 10:53:58__

> OK, but not live tracking like many other delivery companies.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 09:58:56__

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> It is OK, but sometimes the tracking isn't updated and when booking a redelivery it says it is still pending<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:24:40__

> was sending a valuable item to Ireland on Special Delivery guaranteed by 13:00 next day - Didn't arrive until about 14:00 the day after. Much stress involved!!! Not the service I normally expect or get!<br> :date: __2021-05-23 08:37:45__

> Useful app but it needs the ability to clearly define a safe delivery location, extra star when this feature is provided in the app<br> :date: __2021-05-22 10:54:22__

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> A little tricky to navigate, card received for a parcel but with no tracking number, nor anyway of getting feedback eg:with an online help assistant, which would be enormously useful.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 14:41:16__

> Trying to re book a delivery and when you have to confirm at the end all I get is an error message. The app is rubbish it doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:11:28__

> Tries to go through send process but everyone I tapped confirm button it would open the same page again<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:07:13__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Why is it that with the Dominos app I can literally watch as my pizza travels along the roads but the best Royal Mail can do is narrow it down to half a day, and, it's in the town you live in?<br> :date: __2021-05-15 10:43:48__

> Not with enough info:as to redirecting parcel when tracking a parcel not helpful no telephone num:or chatline parcel far away from my home. In this NHS 2U part of this issues could only leave a short message feedback and chat useless. Had id known about parcel being dispatched and incorrect forwarding address could had acted much quicker.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 05:17:12__

> Constantly having to log back in with the app giving a pop up of my log in has expired<br> :date: __2021-05-13 09:42:23__

> Unable to confirm the status of your item We have not attempted to deliver your item yet please try again later. So it only tracks deliveries made? Sssuuuupppppeeeerrrrr useful<br> :date: __2021-05-11 19:23:54__

> I ordered a mobility scooter which Royal Mail claim to have delivered, however I never received it. When I tried to resolve the matter I was fobbed off. I sent an email to customer service but never received a reply.<br> :date: __2021-06-27 12:17:41__

> 2 out of 10.it does not work PROPERLY<br> :date: __2021-06-26 00:34:22__

> No tracking number left<br> :date: __2021-06-24 17:36:09__

> It's SHAMEFUL that the app requires you to sign up in order to use a basic feature like finding a post box. That's genuinely absurd and completely indefensible to put any form of barrier to accessing a public service. I'm shocked that somebody thought this was a reasonable thing to do.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 10:21:22__

> Lost parcel<br> :date: __2021-06-22 21:46:42__

> no international. you need help? pretty much useless. you mention no date for feature. it only cuts out 98% of the world.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 11:58:25__

> Birthday flowers delivered 2 days late.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 10:19:53__

> Why do you force people to create an account? Completely unnecessary. The app should store tracking numbers without this.<br> :date: __2021-06-22 03:01:56__

> New update keeps crashing when using the tracking option. Come on Royal Mail, this app is a Train Wreck, no longer fit for purpose. Edit, so Royal Mail, any update in the offing? As it's utterly useless to me at the mo, come on finger out!! Its not working again as of 20/06/21<br> :date: __2021-06-21 11:26:26__

> absolutely useless app, useless royal mail, 100% dog\*\*\*\*<br> :date: __2021-06-20 14:21:48__
