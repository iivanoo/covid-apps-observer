In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great so far, easy to use and motivational<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:13:29__

> Brilliant app! Really good to get you into running<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:11:20__

> Only done week one but so far feeling really good about it 😁<br> :date: __2021-02-23 18:05:28__

> Awesome app. I'm not a fan of jogging/running at all but this app has made getting into it so easy. Huge bonus I can play BBC sounds while using the app. And the trainer always says I'm doing a good job<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:05:55__

> Great to get you started even if you haven't exercised for a long time (or ever!).<br> :date: __2021-02-23 09:18:31__

> Struggled with a recurring injury and this has been a great help easing me back into running!<br> :date: __2021-02-23 09:08:13__

> Great app! It's really helping me get back into running. I love the choice of coach and music. If there was an option for maintenance to keep you going once you get to your goal, that would be great. It really gives me motivation to keep going, thanks! Update: now completed the programme and now using the last run to keep me motivated on my runs. Brilliant programme!<br> :date: __2021-02-23 08:38:02__

> It Works!! 😊 easy to follow, never had a problem with it. Push go and your personal choice of voice over trainer keeps you timed, motivated and educated on the best way to learn to run. Jo Wiley was my preference as she was so motivating and positive ... really help mental and physical health.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 07:49:34__

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-23 00:52:05__

> I started using Couch to 5k to get back into running. I was fairly dubious that it would help me, but I am super duper impressed. I can run faster and further than I had been able to in ages and I'm super impressed so thank you! I highly recommend this app.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 23:28:44__

> Really helpful in establishing a running routine which progresses. I like the fact you can choose your mentor..some I found really annoying but the two I have used are great. My only criticism is that over the three runs for each week the commentary doesn't change and sometimes this doesn't make sense. Anyway, this app has taken me to my goal of running for 30mins three times a week. So, what's not to like!?<br> :date: __2021-02-23 12:43:30__

> Very helpful and motivating. Could be improved by integrating with actual training done, e.g. recognising the dates of runs, that they are regular or not, and changing the messages.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 09:02:48__

> Amazing<br> :date: __2021-02-22 16:45:41__

> Does what it says on the tin.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 08:00:51__

> Helpful encouragement that got me off the couch and able to run 7K. I was not fit but was fat before I started. I'm fitter and thinner now.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 14:43:48__

> Great way to get into running. Really helped me. Highly recommended.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 10:56:17__

> Very surprised by how much it made me feel, happier, healthier, and being able to happily jog for that length of time... 😀<br> :date: __2021-02-20 18:10:33__

> Been using it for a week, good so far<br> :date: __2021-02-20 11:13:29__

> Just wish it didn't pause when I close screen grrrr is there a sitting I'm missing<br> :date: __2021-02-20 10:01:05__

> Easy to follow and works<br> :date: __2021-02-19 18:35:04__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> Good workout, however it doesn't tell me when my cool down walk is finished or save my progress at the end of each run<br> :date: __2021-02-22 15:02:22__

> Good exercise program, got me up and running. App constantly crashes recently, not sure if there's compatibility issues with Strava but it hasn't worked properly for the last couple of months<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:34:54__

> Really helped me go from not being able to run at all to going over 7k by week 8. I'm not ever going to be a runner but I feel fitter. It was really annoying that you couldn't always select the presenter you wanted. Also if the phone rang then the app stopped working, and I didn't realise so had to start again!<br> :date: __2021-02-20 18:01:28__

> Sometimes difficult to hear trainer over music. Regularly have to change trainer due to issues<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:19:59__

> V V easy to use. Running time is irrelevant, as distance covered depends upon pace....? But its perfect for motivation! Recommend it, yep!<br> :date: __2021-02-16 22:16:29__

> Great app when it works. I frequently have to reboot the app multiple times before the audio etc actually comes through.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:10:45__

> Somehow, I managed to have 4 copies going at the same time, out of sync. There was no way to stop them. It shouldn't be possible to start it while a copy is running.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:00:41__

> They need to bring it to wearables/iwatch<br> :date: __2021-02-11 10:48:34__

> This app is amazing. After 9 intense weeks I am able to run more than 5k. This app is magical. The reason why I'm rating it 3 stars is sometimes the app becomes buggy during some runs like the music won't fade why your coach speaks to you.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:47:20__

> The app is great and really helps teaching you to run. I am not at 5 k yet but I can run for 30 minutes. The only reason I rated 3 is that it bugged quite a bit on week 5 and started taking me through the week 4 routine again. I was also disappointed that the voice over did not change run to run or at least for the last run of the week.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 11:05:09__

> Great concept, however crashes every time i use it so unable to use as intended.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 16:32:15__

> I'm sad to give this such a low review. Because if it worked properly it would easily be the best app available for this. Unfortunately no matter what I do or how I alter the settings as soon as the screen is locked and the phone is in my pocket this app stops working. It requires my phone screen to be unlocked and the app to be open in order to work and that simply isnt compatible with running. I hope they fix it because as I said if it's working properly its way above all other alternatives.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 13:19:25__

> Good at first and helped me get running but the app was constantly crashing. Ended up using the plan but not the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:14:57__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> It's a great concept and I enjoy using it for the most part but I am sick and tired of the app crashing mid run. Edit - 8/2/21 still crashes mid run. Absolutely useless!<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:00:46__

> Got the app last weekend been out on 2 runs inbetween gym sessions and on both runs the app has just stopped!<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:28:50__

> The running schedule is great and I'm really enjoying it. Michael Johnson's audio is motivational without being cheesey. I have an Honor phone so the app shuts down part way through a run, apparently there's nothing the developers can do about this. I have downloaded a free interval timer that does the job and runs successfully in the background without issue, and just use the Couch to 5k app for the schedule and to log my runs.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 17:33:40__

> The app is fine but doesn't seem to to work with Surface earbuds. The audio sends to pause when connected to wireless earbuds<br> :date: __2021-02-07 14:15:46__

> The principle is good but I'm now at the end of week 5 and giving up on this app. The app has crashed on me the past 5 or 6 times I've been out for a run which becomes frustrating as you lose your position in your session. It has worked to get me off the couch and I am covering 5k but not running the full 5k yet. The bugs need to be addressed as this is a great app when it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 14:09:09__

> Keeps cutting out mid session<br> :date: __2021-02-20 20:27:04__

> I can't hear any of the coaches. I have tried deleting and redownloading, freeing space on my phone... Just doesn't do much! Having to manually time my runs which is much less fun. Any advice appreciated for android/google<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:44:43__

> Keeps closing down and what was meant to be a positive start became rather frustrating. Will be looking for other apps to use<br> :date: __2021-02-19 11:55:55__

> Keeps cutting out while on runs<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:47:15__

> Not fit for purpose - app stops running when phone closes/locks. But if you keep phone unlocked you cannot put the phone in your pocket or armband as you inadvertently press pause/exit etc<br> :date: __2021-02-11 15:43:16__

> Any tips to prevent this App closing on itself? It keeps happening several times every run<br> :date: __2021-02-10 19:32:34__

> Boring<br> :date: __2021-02-10 11:35:11__

> Horrendous app. Completed first run and the app shut itself off 4 times so had to keep restarting, thought it may have just been a glich so stuck with it for the next two runs, done exactly the same thing!! So off putting, concept is good, shame the app doesn't actually follow suit<br> :date: __2021-02-04 16:37:40__

> Rubbish, finished the run and there is no way to view stats, distance, speed etc. It says couch to 5k but there's no way to check. Of course you could run another app alongside it but after music and this that would be 3 apps running simultaneously, the start running app is well better...sorry Jo<br> :date: __2021-02-01 20:50:55__

> Frustrating - the app is not saving my runs and not letting me progress to later week runs. I only want this app to do one thing and that is play a series of podcasts and it doesn't do that.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 12:44:37__
