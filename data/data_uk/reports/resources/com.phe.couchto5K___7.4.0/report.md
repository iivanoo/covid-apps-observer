In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Brilliant - turning a non running 51 slightly chubby bloke into a slightly less chubby runner!! Highly recommended. 😁<br> :date: __2021-02-06 16:02:31__

> This is the 3rd time I've started couch to 5k as I've needed to stop after a while due to personal circumstances - I rave about this to everyone... YOUR FITNESS IS IRRELEVANT! anyone can do it, honestly it's fantastic. & the fact it makes it so achievable gives you such a feel good vibe. I've completed this before at 17 stone with no previous exercise. Try it!<br> :date: __2021-02-06 15:42:53__

> This is a great app for beginner runners, slowly easing you into running. The only thing that let's the app down is having to change your guide, telling you the guide you chose is no longer available. Apart from this, I would rate the couch to 5k app all day long 😊<br> :date: __2021-02-06 19:53:46__

> Good easy instructions.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 17:23:42__

> Good 9 week program, but occasionally crashes midway through a run which is very annoying<br> :date: __2021-02-06 17:20:12__

> I've used this app a number of times when I want to get my running mojo and confidence back. I think it's great for new and returning runners<br> :date: __2021-02-05 12:21:06__

> Found it really useful, encouraging to get me running again. Having the voice of another human urging you on certainly helped me get to 5K goal. Will find a way to continue using it for my weekly runs. It's a very good app if you want to start running.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 11:43:59__

> A good incentive<br> :date: __2021-02-04 11:36:04__

> Nice easy steps which ease you into the training. Having the celebs giving words of encouragement is nice but would prefer if they were actually running with me!😁<br> :date: __2021-02-03 18:14:27__

> It managed to get me runnig so it must be good! I had problems with the trainer as I had to keep resetting them as occasionally came up as unavailable so had to change.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 16:52:00__

> Love the app. Really motivated me to start running. Would love to be able to look back at the stats from my run and see a map of my run.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 15:58:34__

> Really good app I would prefer if there was a few more time checks when you're running. The coach you choose doesn't always seem available and its not obvious how to change them.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 12:49:35__

> It's good except as others have reviewed, it does keep stopping. I'm going to try going into airplane mode next time to see if it's notifications or emails that are somehow making it stop. Love the way Sarah Milligan keeps telling me how well I'm doing (I tell her she's killing me!) and is now calling me "Flower"!<br> :date: __2021-02-06 16:10:17__

> Content is great, I've just completed my second week and I am progressing. However, app not always reliable. Sometimes complains it cant load audio files and has frozen at times. 5 stars for content, 2 for reliability.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 18:53:22__

> Keeps crashing but great idea Started ok but since around 15/1/21 the app shuts down sometime in the first 15 minutes. Can leave you warming up for too long or continuing the first run for too long. Only when you notice and restart the app do you find out you're back at the beginning again. Great idea, love Sarah's voice but not much use unless this can be fixed.Now on week 4 and it's do e in twice on two runs. Please fix it. OnePlus6, all up to date<br> :date: __2021-01-30 15:52:19__

> When the App is working it is fantastic. I've managed to get to wk 3. However keeps crashing and not logging the run.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 00:22:08__

> Stopping talking to me halfway through !!<br> :date: __2021-01-28 21:32:47__

> Excellent, basic, but with annoying flaws. I recommend this, but it is so annoying when the app tells you a run is complete, but all record of it is then lost as you haven't manually saved it. Then having reminder alarms to run going off while you're running is just silly. Five starts with a bit more thought in usability.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 08:02:44__

> There's good points to this app - the timer page and run breakdowns, but it often seems to not work smoothly and almost every time I have to change my trainer selection for some reason!<br> :date: __2021-01-24 09:30:36__

> Keeps asking me to reassign a trainer. Other than that..when I do have a trainer it works well, motivating...etc etc all good very encouraging..<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:16:51__

> App is great to start running but as soon as my screen turns off the app stops counting time.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 11:50:52__

> Great but it doesn't save my repeat runs only the 1st run I ever did on that run. I have done about 4 runs on week 3 and it still shows only the 1st run I did 4 months ago! I am having to use other apps like Strava or my fitness watch to see my history. This seems like a very basic thing to fix?!<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:59:59__

> The principle is good but I'm now at the end of week 5 and giving up on this app. The app has crashed on me the past 5 or 6 times I've been out for a run which becomes frustrating as you lose your position in your session. It has worked to get me off the couch and I am covering 5k but not running the full 5k yet. The bugs need to be addressed as this is a great app when it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 14:09:09__

> The structure is good for first time runners but the app closes constantly losing the place you're at during your run.. Really not useful for actually tracking progress<br> :date: __2021-02-03 14:29:24__

> The app closes itself after a short time, so I can't listen to music while using it, I have to keep my phone open and move the timer to where I think it last stopped. Very annoying. It loses my day every time, putting me back to day one.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 08:26:42__

> Great plan but shocking how much it crashes in the middle of runs. Will delete and try and find a better app that actually works.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:04:25__

> The concept is good, but the app itself is fairly poorly written and has multiple issues. It loses the coach audio causing you to reset it. It has bugs that causes it to lose focus and thus lose the audio mid run. It has crashed a couple of times and has also stated that it needs more storage (100mb) when over 100 GB is free on both SD card and internal storage. The actual couch 2 5KM is an excellent approach and am really enjoying it. The app whilst bug ridden is usable on a run by run basis<br> :date: __2021-01-24 18:45:46__

> Downloaded on to a Huawei & it doesn't work during workouts when background closes, you have to keep opening & fast forwarding it to continue the workout or you could be running/walking for hours.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:00:28__

> Keeps out half way through the run.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:14:51__

> The timer stops working or lags when your screen goes black and I ended up walking much more in the beginning as a warm up than I should have done and was running for much longer than I should have been. Therefore, even though the concept is great, it really didn't work as I didn't have any structure to follow in the end and might as well just run at my own pace.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 00:23:14__

> Keeps shutting down on honor 10 even after settings change<br> :date: __2021-01-10 14:09:52__

> I started using this app again but it'd cut out on me several times and had to use a stopwatch instead and no progress logged<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:04:53__

> Horrendous app. Completed first run and the app shut itself off 4 times so had to keep restarting, thought it may have just been a glich so stuck with it for the next two runs, done exactly the same thing!! So off putting, concept is good, shame the app doesn't actually follow suit<br> :date: __2021-02-04 16:37:40__

> Rubbish, finished the run and there is no way to view stats, distance, speed etc. It says couch to 5k but there's no way to check. Of course you could run another app alongside it but after music and this that would be 3 apps running simultaneously, the start running app is well better...sorry Jo<br> :date: __2021-02-01 20:50:55__

> Frustrating - the app is not saving my runs and not letting me progress to later week runs. I only want this app to do one thing and that is play a series of podcasts and it doesn't do that.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 12:44:37__

> Keeps cutting out half way through . Deleted it and download again but still does the same<br> :date: __2021-01-29 19:18:10__

> Plan is good, but app keeps disconnecting<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:02:47__

> It's changed. I used it last year and it was brilliant but now it stops during the warm up walk and I end up walking for longer before I realise. Then I have to restart the app, find my place and start again, only for it to repeat. I would love to keep using it as I found it to be really beneficial for me.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 20:07:49__

> Nothing happens when I hit Go. Sometimes the timer will count down but no audio. Tried shutting all other apps down, reset app, restarted phone. Very glitchy! Something must be up as it's worked on my phone before.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 00:29:47__

> App always stops<br> :date: __2021-01-22 17:18:29__

> Stopped working correctly - it freezes when I start it up. It used to be fine, but the minute I press go, it goes for 1 second then stops. Audio stops, timer stops, it just won't work. Not sure if there's been an update which has messed it up but my phone (Google pixel 3) is up to date. Please fix it, this is my running lifeline<br> :date: __2021-01-21 00:05:01__

> Keeps closing down. Each time Im outside running it stays on for a bit. I think when the Internet connection goes down slightly it just shuts completely and I have to start all over again! So annoying! Does anyone know a better app here? Or is it something tthat Im not doing right?? It shouldn't be so hard... :(<br> :date: __2021-01-20 20:12:39__
