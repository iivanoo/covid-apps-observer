In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very good for couch potatoes like me<br> :date: __2021-01-09 18:11:54__

> I never ever ever thought I would be able to jog/run. I'm normally more of a walker but this has changed my whole mindset towards exercise and it's amazing to be able to see your progress and see yourself getting fitter. Would totally recommend to anyone as you can set your own pace. A nice jog to stay in fat burn zone or a proper run for cardio. Im just about to start week 7 and I can now do 25 mins solid. Very proud of myself and it's really helped my mental health as well as my physical.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 16:55:07__

> I am someone who has never liked running. Tried this as other sports closed due to Covid lockdown. Just completed week 1 and actually quite enjoyed it. Definitely a sense of achievement, and you're eased into running nice and gently. Looking forward to Week 2..<br> :date: __2021-01-09 16:26:24__

> Motivating<br> :date: __2021-01-09 16:04:49__

> Does what it says<br> :date: __2021-01-09 13:45:54__

> I've never been fond of running but realised I needed to get fitter. A good friend recommended this and it's been a revelation. Pick the coach you want to encourage you and get going. Don't beat yourself up if you don't reach your target every week, as you'll get there eventually. I actually enjoy running now.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 13:27:17__

> I love this app! Just graduated today and this is the first thing in years that has got me doing regular exercise and enjoying it! The only fault I have found is that it keeps 'losing' my trainer and I have to reset it, minor inconvenience though.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 13:08:06__

> As an absolute beginner runner, this app has been so useful in gaining my courage and stamina in running. I'm currently on week 5 and I think the progression each week is achievable and supportive. I love hearing Sarah Milican's little voice on each run and I'm really enjoying the programme. I ran 3.5K on my last run- which I'm so happy with. This app has given me a routine whilst in lockdown.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 12:47:31__

> Good app.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 12:20:40__

> Very helpful, love Jo Whixley talking to me as I'm a solo runner 🐕<br> :date: __2021-01-09 11:50:34__

> Only on week 2 but sticking it it and I feel great when I've finished.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 15:43:05__

> Easy to follow and use App. Very motivational, especially for a novice runner. Highly recommended<br> :date: __2021-01-08 21:46:40__

> I'm really enjoying it so far, it is slightly buggy in the respect that it tells me I haven't got the space on my phone to play the audio when I know I definitely have, but it's great when it works<br> :date: __2021-01-08 20:02:27__

> great at first, weeks 7 - 9 though, the app kept resetting itself mid run<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:15:56__

> Great app<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:01:58__

> Just started this app. Enjoying it so far week 1. Keeping me motivated. Cant work out if I can play music during the non talking silent moments though.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 14:00:02__

> Fantastic app, highly recommended to anyone who wants to get fitter, start running, or get back into fitness after lay off. The only thing I would say is I enjoyed the couch and would of liked to hear more from them during the runs.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 13:19:25__

> My one problem was the fluctuating sound. Towards the end of each run, the sound went much quieter, and I struggled to hear what was being said<br> :date: __2021-01-08 13:03:49__

> Really helpful, helps you concentrate on your goals as well as being encouraging<br> :date: __2021-01-07 19:00:32__

> Really enjoying support<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:12:20__

> Undecided but will attempt to stick with the programme for time being<br> :date: __2021-01-08 17:44:06__

> I've used the app before and got up to week 5 before stopping. I recently started again. PROBLEMS: The mid run notification no longer sounds, which is a bit annoying. The notifications I set in the app to remind me to go for a run do not appear, despite the app having notification permissions. Also, the integration with Spotify is poor; sometimes the app pauses the Spotify audio then doesn't resume it once the coach has finished speaking, other times the coach just talks over the audio.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 14:00:10__

> Seems to be slow to respond, but the main issue is the audio level of the coach, against music, is too low. I can't find any way to adjust the levels.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 20:34:58__

> This app does what it says on the tin basically however, I do have to leave my phone unlocked as it crashes every time the screen goes blank.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 15:50:31__

> Really have issues with the app on a brand new samsung s20... freezes on first tab and can't navigate to other sections without force stopping app.. and when i do manage to get into other areas of the app I've been looking for the 'getting started' section mentioned in a few places under the support section but no link or indication as to where to find the getting started section? Hope someone can help..<br> :date: __2021-01-05 11:24:54__

> Freezes A Lot - this is an excellent idea for beginner runners or people returning to fitness after a break, to get clear and supportive assistance on keeping up the running. However the app freezes a lot which is quite annoying when trying to use it.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:38:19__

> A great program, but utterly ruined by the ghastly b-roll 'celebs' constantly interrupting you once you get into the zone. You will suddenly get your audiobook switched to mute so that you can listen to minutes of patronising mouth noises about (quite literally!) "You are now halfway through this part of the run, and it must hurrrrrt, but try not to think about the paiiiiin, and how much further you have to run!". It is demotivating, and the audiobook is not paused either. So I miss loads >:(<br> :date: __2021-01-04 09:44:49__

> Really like the audio but everytime I head out it cannot play my selected trainer and I have to select another. Enjoying the programme itself but not the clunky audio<br> :date: __2021-01-03 21:20:02__

> It seems to bounce out of the app when I am running. So I have to keep logging in. Not sure if it is because it is so cold or because I have my music on. Or both. I have only completed day two. I am living Sarah telling me what to do. 😂<br> :date: __2021-01-03 10:26:06__

> Crashed half way through a run. Took me a while to realise<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:42:13__

</p>

> I started using this app again but it'd cut out on me several times and had to use a stopwatch instead and no progress logged<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:04:53__

> I like the app and love my coach Michael Johnson. But it stops mid run on EVERY SINGLE RUN, rendering itself useless. Very very frustrating. It would also be good if the coach pep talks varied from run to run (rather than week to week) in the early weeks.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:17:12__

> I had heard good things about this app, unfortunately the app cuts off quite frequently and this is really disheartening when you are in the middle of a run. If they get this bug fixed then I would give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 21:06:48__

> The app is a great idea and well thought out. Having a coach is nice and I like that it has a reminder feature. However, the app consistantly crashes at least twice during a run. Not so bad when you are on a walking session, but particularly annoying when you are running. I have set the recommended power settings for my phone but it still crashes. Also it often asks me to reset the trainer as the audio is not available or my phone is out of memory (not true).So nice idea if it worked properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:26:39__

> I was really pleased with this app however on week two it lost all of the sound (the instructions) which quite frankly makes it useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference. A real shame!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:46:07__

> I love the guides running, however the app simply doesn't work properly. I have changed the settings to manage manually multiple times yet it always stops mid run. Whenever you reopen the app, you have to start the run all over again. Please fix this, it's a real pity.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 15:49:04__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> Kept crashing!, didn't even get half way through first session, it had stopped working 3 times<br> :date: __2021-01-07 14:43:07__

> Every time I started the first run it would shut down the moment I got a notification from another app despite me having changed the settings so that it ran over other apps. Extremely disappointed. It was pretty much useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 08:56:19__

> Used to work ok with an occasional crash now & then but now it just doesn't even start up! If it does, it doesn't work, no progress, no audio. What's the point of an app which doesn't work on the latest Android version?<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:18:49__

> App just shows blank white screen. If you manage to get past this, the app crashes either on main run screen or partway through runs, so then you lose your progress. Really disappointing. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 11:12:59__

> App wont even start just loads a white screen and freezes<br> :date: __2021-01-05 10:29:45__

> Freezes all the time, can't even start the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 00:39:54__

> It freezes as soon as I open it<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:54:28__

> Crashes, freezes, blank screen. Can't progress from looking at the Week 1 screen.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:48:00__

> Was excited to use this app. I have a 2 year old son and have recently quit smoking. I've heard a lot about this app and thought it could help me get fit again. After using once on my first run it kept crashing and losing my place. Now, after uninstalling the app, its crashing ever app I'm trying to use. Messed up my phone and feel worse than when I started.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:19:06__

> Crash- couldn't even start the app it kept crashing<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:54:42__
