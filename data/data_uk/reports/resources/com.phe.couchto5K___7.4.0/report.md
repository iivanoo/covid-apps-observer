In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very easy to use app and its free<br> :date: __2021-03-14 15:02:26__

> Excellent. Wish the BBC did a 5-10k one.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 14:21:22__

> An excellent programme to get off the couch and get moving towards the 5k distance! I got recommended by quite a few people and now I can do the same. If you're either a first time runner or looking to get back into a routine of movement, I would highly recommend this to you.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 13:29:18__

> Really enjoyed the 9 week runs tough at times but I pushed on and completed today.Not to bad I'm 67 and not done any running since school days......<br> :date: __2021-03-14 12:35:21__

> Great app and from this unfit 56yr old it helped me so much. Can't believe I actually completed it and I wouldn't have without using the voice which prompted and supported me.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 11:14:47__

> Fantastic<br> :date: __2021-03-14 11:10:14__

> Brilliant! Slow and steady start. Be mindful of your running technique to avoid little injuries and you'll be running 5k 3 times a week before you know it!<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:52:51__

> Good motivation<br> :date: __2021-03-14 08:45:55__

> On week 3 and have more enthusiasm than ever !<br> :date: __2021-03-14 00:17:03__

> Absolutely brilliant. I have exercised for years doing spun classes and biitcamps but always dismissed running as the most boring thing in the world. With the pandemic running was the only option available so I've embraced it. I LOVE it and am hooked. Working at home and all the sitting I've done in the past year through the pandemic I put on weight as many have. I've now lost 2 stone in the past 10 weeks and the app has been an important part of my journey. I will continue to run 5k 3x pw<br> :date: __2021-03-13 22:57:12__

> App works as it should do, would be nice to add GPS tracking.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 11:41:10__

> Great app, Good motivators, but playing music alongside can be difficult as the volume of the motivators is not then loud enough. If you turn the volume up to be able to hear them, you then get deafened by your music volume.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:15:53__

> Good workout for beginners but as always still drops out sometimes<br> :date: __2021-03-14 10:14:43__

> It took a few attempts before I did all the app. I am amazed that I can run for 30 minutes but you have to do the hard work. Not being interrupted with ads was good. I enjoyed the app and would recommend it.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 09:45:58__

> Really good. Me and my fiance have just completed week 9. Only one small niggle- On the longer runs in weeks 5 onwards, there are long empty silences in the app where Iwe would have appreciated a bit more 'coaching'.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 19:26:59__

> Very easy to follow<br> :date: __2021-03-13 17:06:36__

> Worked through all the weeks successfully and found it really focused me and what I wanted to achieve. Would have liked a little more encouragement during the runs but did enjoy the program<br> :date: __2021-03-13 16:27:15__

> Just finished today. Got through fairly easily. Only negative had to keep changing trainer.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 16:13:54__

> Its a good beginners running programme, slow and steady progression with the ability to repeat each one until the user feels they have progressed enough to move on, this also reduces the chance of injury. A few points: the programme seems to jump some time from 8 minutes upto upto 20 mins at wk5- run 3. It would also be good if each session totalled 40 mins inc the warm up/cool down walks as they vary in time.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 14:55:44__

> I am enjoying it so far the only thing that I would change is today was my 2nd run but it said to do it twice more before moving onto week 2.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 13:18:46__

> This is my third run sabbataged by this app. The app just stops, time pauses or just closes itself. :( it's not all bad as it's helped me get to week 7, but its so frustrating, please fix these issues and when your phone rings the app continues to play, I ignored a call and it paused itself. Yes another run I have to repeat.<br> :date: __2021-03-14 11:37:22__

> Keeps kicking me out mid run but other than that it's very helpful<br> :date: __2021-03-13 17:24:32__

> Great app however having some issues in my 2nd week run. The app stops working on my last 90 sec routine thereby losing all the effort I've put in. It's demoralising.<br> :date: __2021-03-12 20:04:26__

> I did 3 runs but it wouldn't register any run after the first one so I'm uninstall and reinstalling see if that fixes it. Otherwise I like it except u have to manually set yr next reminder after each run. Wld be better if u cls set days u regularly going to run and get a reminder automatically. But easy to use and I like the commentary.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 19:36:34__

> Great app and has helped alot, but keeps stopping throughout run.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 09:03:14__

> Great way to kick start my health however not so great when the app keeps crashing 😒<br> :date: __2021-03-08 16:27:39__

> Very good, I would give it 5 stars if you could listen to your own music and not have to stream someone else's choice of what I should listen to.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 00:10:09__

> First time using, the app clearly kept freezing. I was running for more than a minute, it took me 49 minutes to complete, listening and following the instructions, but should've taken 30 minutes, including warm up and cool down. Dissapointing.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 23:42:10__

> I really like this app, it's an excellent way to start running, see real results and make yourself feel good. But it's very buggy? Sometimes the clock will freeze and won't count down properly meaning you run or walk longer then you should.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:11:23__

> Great app but crashes all the time which is really frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 10:03:03__

> My phone locks after however long but unfortunately it pauses the app. Absolutely useless in that regard. Would be better linked to maps to compare previous runs and pace.<br> :date: __2021-03-13 23:00:12__

> I love the idea behind the app but it's functionality is often lacking<br> :date: __2021-03-10 20:41:49__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-03-10 08:51:07__

> Whenever I use something like spotify the run stops i have been on 3 walks now and it thinks I've done 0<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:10:23__

> Cuts out<br> :date: __2021-02-24 21:37:55__

> Great concept, however crashes every time i use it so unable to use as intended.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 16:32:15__

> I'm sad to give this such a low review. Because if it worked properly it would easily be the best app available for this. Unfortunately no matter what I do or how I alter the settings as soon as the screen is locked and the phone is in my pocket this app stops working. It requires my phone screen to be unlocked and the app to be open in order to work and that simply isnt compatible with running. I hope they fix it because as I said if it's working properly its way above all other alternatives.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 13:19:25__

> Good at first and helped me get running but the app was constantly crashing. Ended up using the plan but not the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:14:57__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> Great concept - very poor app. The Couch to 5K is a great idea. I downloaded the app last week and started week 1 and all was well. I did my first week 2 run the other day and noticed that the runs seemed to be lasting longer than 90 seconds, I then realised that when my phone locks so does the app. I tried it again on my second week 2 run today and the same happend. This is very poor and the app should stay active when the phone is locked, like other apps do. This needs fixing.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 14:35:23__

> I love the concept of the app, but it's garbage, crashes frequently mid run. Also there's no way of syncing your data, if you get a new phone you lose your progress.<br> :date: __2021-03-11 12:19:04__

> Really liked it on my first run but ever since that one I can't get onto the next run. It just says coach unavailable pick new one in settings. It doesn't allow me to do that so I have to reset and keep repeating the first run. Disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 15:04:26__

> The audio does not work when i start it, despite changing the settings. Had to resort to putting the times on my fitbit as an interval workout. Seems to be a common problem wity Huawei phones.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 13:01:02__

> Great idea but doesn't work. I have done 3 runs on one run the program just shut down and on the other run it shut down 3 times in the run and I had to re start it and skip ahead to where I was. I will try a different app if the next run doesn't work. Please sort this out, it's extremely disruptive. Thank you<br> :date: __2021-03-03 09:23:00__

> Not a good start. Sarah Millican has always been annoying, can't stand her voice. Other options no better. Can we have more trainer voices please 🙏<br> :date: __2021-03-02 20:35:55__

> Terrible, clicks off when your phone locks or when u open another app<br> :date: __2021-03-01 15:20:40__

> Supported by the BBC. Okay, I'm out.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 00:38:14__

> App doesn't work and won't open<br> :date: __2021-02-27 22:45:03__
