## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I am going into my last week of couch5k,I have loved it ,I've never ran in my life ,and I will be 61 in January 2021 .I cannot wait to do a 5k marathon, when time allows. But for now I will keep on running...cheers !!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-29 21:11:21__

> Motivation using it<br> :date: __2020-11-29 19:54:28__

> It has got me running. Simple to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:38:25__

> Never thought I would achieve this as I struggled in week 1. I finished week 9 today. I'm absolutely amazed! I will try to continue however I do favour week 6 & 7.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:09:15__

> good<br> :date: __2020-11-29 15:26:43__

> Great app to get fit on<br> :date: __2020-11-29 14:15:42__

> Nicely paced training. Clever idea to allow your own playlist/radio/podcast to be played while the app fades in as required<br> :date: __2020-11-29 09:04:45__

> A great way to get back into running after several years<br> :date: __2020-11-28 23:06:54__

> Makes running manageable<br> :date: __2020-11-29 11:57:54__

> Easy to use but can't seem to keep my trainer of choice<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:47:09__

> Brilliant app has got me to running for 30mins 3x week! I would love now a 5k to 10k with the same people. Thank you Sarah Millican couldn't of done it without you.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 11:36:35__

> It will give people on their own some help and not feel lonely. I enjoyed every day that I went out. Don't make excuses for not going out just because it is colder. I listened to the radio so I didn't concentrate on how long I was jogging or how many steps I had taken. I will continue my jog.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 22:37:51__

> I haven't exercised in anger for many of years, so for a couch potato this app works well for me. I'm half way through the program and feel awesome. Only complaint would be the voice overs were more varied and a bit more engaging.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 21:37:49__

> Possibly the worst app. Continuously skipped and couldn't hear the trainer over my music so was pretty much running in silence. UPDATE - i reinstalled this app after 2 years and it's improved considerably. Definitely recommend.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 19:04:28__

> I love the app. Its helped me complete the Couch to 5k. I would have liked each run to be individualised not just the whole week. Not very motivational to have the same sentences repeated 3 times in a week.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 14:52:08__

> The app is quite basic but does everything you really need. Downloaded as i prefer Sarah Millican to the version you can download seperately. I only wish the speaking had been slightly tweaked when a run is repeated so it doesn't say stuff like 'you have to do it two more times if this is your first run.' I didn't think i could follow the plan being really unfit but found the increases surprisingly manageable.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 14:16:36__

> enjoyable<br> :date: __2020-11-25 08:30:04__

> Would have been 5 stars but app kept crashing. However getting me to run 5k when I never thought it possible gets 5 stars plus!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-24 11:14:57__

> Gets too difficult too quickly, and coach voices are a bit lifeless and uninspiring. But it's got me off my arse and running so doing something right.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 10:02:56__

> It helps. I havent run for ages preferring exercise classes but during lockdown it has helped me keep active<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:20:06__

> App has been very good, excellent place to start your running<br> :date: __2020-11-26 11:41:30__

> Good but touch sensitive that pauses unintentionally<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:48:50__

> It's a really good app to ease into running, but starting on week 3, the app crashes after the first run every single time. It's super annoying as I have to keep the time myself and cannot rely on the trainer's voice to tell me when I can stop. Such a shame given the first two weeks were a bliss. Maybe they'll provide a fix soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 11:37:44__

> Good way to build up running pace. However really annoying that if I don't hold my phone the app stops working 😩<br> :date: __2020-11-23 22:50:39__

> The program itself is great and I'm really enjoying it but the app keeps crashing. I have to keep restarting it which is frustrating when I'm trying to get into a rythmn and flow with my running.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 01:09:53__

> Jo is off putting talking nonsense and making you think its time to stop running, twice now she's ruined my run. So annoying! Only talk when it's time to stop.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:43:51__

> Its great but app keeps on stopping when im using it.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:50:05__

> App is good for workouts and motivation but it does keep crashing<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:38:08__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> The programme is great and the app worked brilliantly over the summer when I first used it. I'm not doing the programme again at a faster speed and I'm having problems with the app asking me to reset the trainer because I'm out of memory (not true) and resets the trainer every time I go out. Please can you review for bugs. Also this time there must have been an update as the podcast no longer stops the background audio when the trainer comes on. This is annoying as I miss patches from the audio.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:59:00__

> This app wouldn't work with headphones and so everyone around you can hear it.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:45:47__

> The plans are great I love that I can listen to my own music.. but... This app keeps crashing it can happen 3 to 4 times a run meaning you loose track of where you are. It happens every time my phone locks and its very demotivating. Please fix soon!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:10:02__

> Difficult to use whilst running. Keeps turning of whether in my arm bag or pocket. Long silences very repetitive<br> :date: __2020-11-24 08:27:31__

> The app is a great idea, it got me up and running which is good, it's just a shame the actual app is about as reliable as the Tories. Every time I lock my screen and put my phone away the app closes down and I have to re-open it and skip ahead to where I was. I'm now forced to download an alternative app to continue making progress, the only reason it's getting two stars is because it got me motivated in the first place. There's better apps available.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 11:44:00__

> Pretty much the shonkiest app out there, crashes 2/3 times per run and has failed to log the last 3 runs. The principle is fine, the execution is very poor.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:05:34__

> The apps only purpose is to ensure you get a clear instruction to run, or to stop running and walk. I've had to reinstall twice before week 8 because the trainer became mute. My music dips, but that's it.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:34:45__

> Resert a session to start randomly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 20:18:17__

> Crashes unexpectedly constantly and therefore making it pretty unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:02:15__

> Originally gave this 5 stars but for the last few weeks it has crashed mid-run without warning, leaving me running and waiting for the coach to tell me to stop! I'm looking for a more stable alternative.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 18:01:36__

> Very good<br> :date: __2020-11-23 15:29:32__

> Dia, continually cuts out. R u b b I s h.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 17:13:44__

> The coach narration/alarms and stuff don't work. Tried listening with music and nothing. Tried without nothing. Not good. Since my last review I still can't hear a damn thing. Got a different app<br> :date: __2020-11-13 10:50:14__

> Didn't really use it<br> :date: __2020-11-12 11:10:10__

> What is that name!? (:<br> :date: __2020-11-12 09:48:11__

> Utterly rubbish, app closes every time I am on the run phase.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 19:14:31__

> The app doesn't work. It starts your workout then stops after 3 minutes. There you are thinking you have done s good job and it hasn't been doing anything. Pointless app. If I could give no stars I would.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:22:50__

> How am I supposed to run 5k?! I'm 4 stone overweight and can't even run upstairs. This is for Olympic athletes not ordinary out of shape people! And how am I supposed to afford trainers and gym gear when I'm out of work due to the coronavirus? Do an app that helps people lose weight not kill themselves running marathons.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:57:36__
