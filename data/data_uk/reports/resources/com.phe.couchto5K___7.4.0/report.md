In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Simple and easy to use. You just have to make a commitment to take the first step and tune in to how you feel before and after you've taken action. I like the choice of mentors to instruct and promote you on your way round. Sarah Milligan is my fav...she makes me smile and that action alone is scientifically proven to impact on your mood. If you want even more support you join the private FB group and get support, inspiration or whatever you need to keep going. Just do it...<br> :date: __2020-12-28 12:12:07__

> Really enjoyed the last 9 weeks. 16 weeks after having my daughter and 7years no running. Pleased to have covered 7k in my last run 🏃‍♂️<br> :date: __2020-12-28 11:36:04__

> Never thought I could do it but managed with the help of this app<br> :date: __2020-12-28 11:12:42__

> Never thought I'd be able to run 5k again... followed this app and now running 5k three times a week- highly recommend!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 10:56:31__

> Great simple approach<br> :date: __2020-12-28 09:49:27__

> Easy and it works!<br> :date: __2020-12-27 23:03:29__

> Couldn't run for more than a minute when I first started the app, now running for over 30 mins in 9 weeks of training.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 18:44:02__

> A really great motivational tool!<br> :date: __2020-12-27 14:47:27__

> Easy to use, let's your music blend in & out, good pace to the exercise regime. Got me to week 9 nice & smoothly, barely noticed the step up in running times, can't recommend highly enough.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 13:44:12__

> This app has done for me exactly what it says. I couldn't run a bath before. Now I run 5k three times a week. And it's free!<br> :date: __2020-12-27 12:16:26__

> Best motivational app for beginners or those getting back into running. I'm using it after having a baby to avoid injury. It would be good if each workout was individual rather than each week being three identical recordings. It doesn't feel so amazing when you've completed the final run of the week and the coach says "repeat this run two more times this week"!<br> :date: __2020-12-28 09:14:44__

> Very easy to get motivated<br> :date: __2020-12-27 16:06:52__

> I give this app 4 stars as the concept is great and it really does get you off the couch and running as long as you follow it religiously (i.e. commit to running 3 times per week). I'm on week 7 and already up to 25 mins non-stop! The reason why I don't give it 5 stars as it does have one minor and one major bug that I wish the developers would fix. The minor bug is that sometimes it loses who your helper is and you have to set it up again (although you don't lose your progress). The main bug I find is that quite often it will lock up with a 'blank screen' causing you to have to restart the app completely. It then takes around 10 mins with another blank screen before coming back to the main menu (not ideal if you are just ready to start a new run). If you could fix these issues this would be a deffo 5 stars!<br> :date: __2020-12-27 11:14:40__

> It's a great program and really shows how we can use technology to help people get fit. I've just had a couple of problems with overlaying the sound over my music but it always works in the end.<br> :date: __2020-12-26 09:28:52__

> Good so far<br> :date: __2020-12-24 16:03:34__

> As others have experienced, I keep losing my choice of trainer which is a pain in the butt..... However the app is simple and effective and does the job.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:42:01__

> I've used the app before and got up to week 5 before stopping. I recently started again and the mid run notification no longer sounds, which is a bit annoying.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 17:13:20__

> Enjoyed the whole experience 😸<br> :date: __2020-12-21 08:37:51__

> Reliable app works well<br> :date: __2020-12-19 18:15:15__

> Finding it easy to follow, getting us off to a good start, one of the trainer voices doesn't work on my phone, no big deal.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:50:07__

> Loved it, then my knees didn't..I will give it another go when I feel my legs, knees are stronger..so, speed walking to it rather than running...<br> :date: __2020-12-22 18:24:23__

> Really good, being able to choose a voice that comfort and motivates you really helps - especially with children. Only issues we have found are that it very often closest he app part way through a run, which is irritating when you're waiting for instruction and that sometimes it doesn't seem to save runs so my son struggles with following his progress<br> :date: __2020-12-22 14:38:54__

> More comentry during run and walk sessions like countdown would be good<br> :date: __2020-12-17 16:08:08__

> Starts off well but it's so frustrating that it crashes or stops working mid run!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:44:52__

> Good but it shuts down when running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:11:11__

> Worked well for the most part, but the app was prone to stopping mid-run; after an ever-lengthening period of silence it was demoralising to check and find that all the progress was lost. I took to using a backup stopwatch after the first few instances of this. The motivation comments were ok, but disappointed that in Weeks 8 & 9, each of the three days were exactly the same recordings; not at all inspiring and a bit cheapskate. Anyway, I achieved what I set out to do, so app successful overall.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 12:20:07__

> Good app but times out a lot if your phone screen does not stay active. Also not good at tracking real time. My phone timer was more useful. But a great intro to running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 11:32:55__

> Good to start with but once you got to the weeks you have to do long runs like for example 5mins non-stop if the phone screen goes to the sleep the app would crush and if you go back to the app it takes you back to the beginning in the middle of your run which was too stressful at times<br> :date: __2020-12-11 17:10:09__

> Nothing to signal that I've completed runs when I have, not sure if this is a bug. Also keeps bringing up a message to say I need to select a different coach as the one I have selected is unavailable.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 21:40:21__

> The app was amazing to start with but over weeks 8 and 9 it has been crashing and losing progress shortly after the 10 minute update every time I run. This has been hugely frustrating. I am so glad I was using Strava too or I would have lost my place / progress completely. In the earlier weeks I found the app really effective. It's a good build up and the encouraging messages and updates through the running really kept me going.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:55:53__

> I had heard good things about this app, unfortunately the app cuts off quite frequently and this is really disheartening when you are in the middle of a run. If they get this bug fixed then I would give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 21:06:48__

> The app is a great idea and well thought out. Having a coach is nice and I like that it has a reminder feature. However, the app consistantly crashes at least twice during a run. Not so bad when you are on a walking session, but particularly annoying when you are running. I have set the recommended power settings for my phone but it still crashes. Also it often asks me to reset the trainer as the audio is not available or my phone is out of memory (not true).So nice idea if it worked properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:26:39__

> I was really pleased with this app however on week two it lost all of the sound (the instructions) which quite frankly makes it useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference. A real shame!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:46:07__

> I love the guides running, however the app simply doesn't work properly. I have changed the settings to manage manually multiple times yet it always stops mid run. Whenever you reopen the app, you have to start the run all over again. Please fix this, it's a real pity.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 15:49:04__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> The programme is great and the app worked brilliantly over the summer when I first used it. I'm not doing the programme again at a faster speed and I'm having problems with the app asking me to reset the trainer because I'm out of memory (not true) and resets the trainer every time I go out. Please can you review for bugs. Also this time there must have been an update as the podcast no longer stops the background audio when the trainer comes on. This is annoying as I miss patches from the audio.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:59:00__

> This app wouldn't work with headphones and so everyone around you can hear it.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:45:47__

> Cannot make run in background No matter what, I cannot get this app to work unless its the only thing I have running. I have given it every permission and it still cuts out. Very disappointing<br> :date: __2020-12-27 08:55:05__

> Decided to start running again, but wanted to start from scratch so downloaded this. One run in and it paused itself throughout. I ended up counting my way through it and ignoring the app.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 14:21:02__

> Terrible why do I have to have some "celebrity" talking to me. I just want to complete the programme on my own. Why is there no option to turn the voice off. Usual bbc rubbish.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 00:09:57__

> Constantly crashes<br> :date: __2020-12-10 08:08:26__

> Keeps turning off, need to restart app. Does not work with my Spotify.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 07:37:08__

> Doesn't work for me on android using Spotify. I get the first couple of directions, then silence.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:59:33__

> I used this app on my Huawei P10 Lite and it worked amazing. I'm about half way through the 9 week programme and I got a new phone for my birthday, a P30 Pro, and it doesn't work. In the help section it doesn't list my phone or it's EMUI so it doesn't look like it's compatible with the newer versions. Hopefully they will update the app at some point. It's so disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:46:44__

> app keeps crashing mid run. waste of time<br> :date: __2020-12-02 20:12:29__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run. It never completes a run now. At least I do.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 20:00:50__

> Crashes unexpectedly constantly and therefore making it pretty unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:02:15__
