## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app to start running!<br> :date: __2020-12-05 14:49:19__

> Brutal but fun 😂🤣<br> :date: __2020-12-05 13:02:07__

> It is hard to start but gets easier every every run day. Stick with it. By the end of the 9 weeks you Will feel great. Definitely go for it!!<br> :date: __2020-12-05 12:49:58__

> Easy build up, confidence growing already faster only 3 weeks<br> :date: __2020-12-05 11:40:03__

> This is a brilliant way to confidently build up running skills. The slow increase each week ensures that a run isnt too challenging and builds confidence. You can also go at your own pace - I often repeated weeks so that I felt comfortable moving on. I chose to Sarah Millican as my commentator - she was a funny and a great motivator. Definitely recommend this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:35:33__

> A fantastic way to start running<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:19:24__

> Great program !<br> :date: __2020-12-05 10:09:38__

> I would like to say thank to this app. I can now run for a hour. I AM NOT FAST. I AM OVER 50 AND 145KG AND I CAN RUN. The hardest part is getting out of the house. Don't worry about people laughing at you. They don't. I just wished I did this earlier. My tips are get good and the right trainers. Gait analysis helps remove the pain. I do have a pain in my knee due to a old injury. Just be mindful of your body. Sometimes a longer rest is ok but never more than 5 days.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 09:08:59__

> Brilliant 👍<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:38:47__

> Brilliant app but does randomly stop during a run which is frustrating 😔<br> :date: __2020-12-05 16:12:37__

> Does what it says on the tin. Stick with and you'll definitely get there<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:09:57__

> Great way to get in to running. App works well.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 12:55:41__

> Having the celebrity to help with the run is really encouraging. The app seems to be good enough for what I am asking it to do.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 09:03:02__

> There are no metrics but if you want an experience that just "does what it says on the tin" the. Give this a shot. It will guide you; and for free I add, though a full couch to 5k course with a choice of trainers.<br> :date: __2020-12-03 09:01:49__

> I actually did it, not bad considering I hate running<br> :date: __2020-12-02 14:48:56__

> Great except you cant get consistency of trainers, and if you change to another it then doesn't recognise your previous runs<br> :date: __2020-12-02 12:37:46__

> Makes running manageable<br> :date: __2020-11-29 11:57:54__

> Easy to use but can't seem to keep my trainer of choice<br> :date: __2020-11-27 16:47:09__

> Brilliant app has got me to running for 30mins 3x week! I would love now a 5k to 10k with the same people. Thank you Sarah Millican couldn't of done it without you.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 11:36:35__

> Would be 5 stars if the sound worked!!<br> :date: __2020-12-05 15:43:45__

> Good programme but app keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-04 13:48:44__

> The concept is great thanks to Sarah millican I went from hating running with a passion to loving my 30 min run, all in 6 months (I went slowly). However when you get to week 7 the recording times out before you get to the halfway bell. Every time. I just used my watch but yeah not great - if not for that would rate a 5.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 10:47:09__

> This was great at first but 3 times whilst out running it's just shut itself down and I've had no idea where I'm upto on the run. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 19:36:14__

> Gets too difficult too quickly, and coach voices are a bit lifeless and uninspiring. But it's got me off my arse and running so doing something right.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 10:02:56__

> It helps. I havent run for ages preferring exercise classes but during lockdown it has helped me keep active<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:20:06__

> App has been very good, excellent place to start your running<br> :date: __2020-11-26 11:41:30__

> Good but touch sensitive that pauses unintentionally<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:48:50__

> It's a really good app to ease into running, but starting on week 3, the app crashes after the first run every single time. It's super annoying as I have to keep the time myself and cannot rely on the trainer's voice to tell me when I can stop. Such a shame given the first two weeks were a bliss. Maybe they'll provide a fix soon.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 11:37:44__

> Good way to build up running pace. However really annoying that if I don't hold my phone the app stops working 😩<br> :date: __2020-11-23 22:50:39__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> The programme is great and the app worked brilliantly over the summer when I first used it. I'm not doing the programme again at a faster speed and I'm having problems with the app asking me to reset the trainer because I'm out of memory (not true) and resets the trainer every time I go out. Please can you review for bugs. Also this time there must have been an update as the podcast no longer stops the background audio when the trainer comes on. This is annoying as I miss patches from the audio.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:59:00__

> This app wouldn't work with headphones and so everyone around you can hear it.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:45:47__

> The plans are great I love that I can listen to my own music.. but... This app keeps crashing it can happen 3 to 4 times a run meaning you loose track of where you are. It happens every time my phone locks and its very demotivating. Please fix soon!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:10:02__

> Difficult to use whilst running. Keeps turning of whether in my arm bag or pocket. Long silences very repetitive<br> :date: __2020-11-24 08:27:31__

> The app is a great idea, it got me up and running which is good, it's just a shame the actual app is about as reliable as the Tories. Every time I lock my screen and put my phone away the app closes down and I have to re-open it and skip ahead to where I was. I'm now forced to download an alternative app to continue making progress, the only reason it's getting two stars is because it got me motivated in the first place. There's better apps available.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 11:44:00__

> Pretty much the shonkiest app out there, crashes 2/3 times per run and has failed to log the last 3 runs. The principle is fine, the execution is very poor.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:05:34__

> I used this app on my Huawei P10 Lite and it worked amazing. I'm about half way through the 9 week programme and I got a new phone for my birthday, a P30 Pro, and it doesn't work. In the help section it doesn't list my phone or it's EMUI so it doesn't look like it's compatible with the newer versions. Hopefully they will update the app at some point. It's so disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:46:44__

> app keeps crashing mid run. waste of time<br> :date: __2020-12-02 20:12:29__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run. It never completes a run now. At least I do.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 20:00:50__

> Crashes unexpectedly constantly and therefore making it pretty unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:02:15__

> Originally gave this 5 stars but for the last few weeks it has crashed mid-run without warning, leaving me running and waiting for the coach to tell me to stop! I'm looking for a more stable alternative.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 18:01:36__

> Very good<br> :date: __2020-11-23 15:29:32__

> Dia, continually cuts out. R u b b I s h.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 17:13:44__

> The coach narration/alarms and stuff don't work. Tried listening with music and nothing. Tried without nothing. Not good. Since my last review I still can't hear a damn thing. Got a different app<br> :date: __2020-11-13 10:50:14__

> Didn't really use it<br> :date: __2020-11-12 11:10:10__
