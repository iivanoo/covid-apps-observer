In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Its been great for me to be able to be guided as someone who is an original couch potato that has never ran before! I liked how i could choose a trainer to talk me through it who i felt i could relate to.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 06:27:37__

> Needs an option to keep the screen on.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 23:56:51__

> Good app although some help with preparing for week one could be helpful for those new to exercise. Update. Amazing. I did it and can now run 5k.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:59:56__

> Good, but makes me reset the trainer each time<br> :date: __2020-11-21 22:47:51__

> Great. Would be even better if each run was coached independently instead of the commentary being repeated each week.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:25:40__

> Amaze balls<br> :date: __2020-11-21 14:24:48__

> It motivates but would like more encouragement and also on week 9 Michael Johnson said goodbye to me 3 times. Would like individual commentary for individual runs not the same spiel for evry run in a week.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 23:39:22__

> Love it, running with Michael Johnson 😍, perfect. The app builds you up and never pushes you further than you are able. I was coming back to running after a bout of Sciatica and working stupid hours in lockdown impacted on my running, i.e. I did none! Am now happily running for 30 minutes again 😀, and got my running mojo back.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:04:05__

> Very good<br> :date: __2020-11-20 12:40:06__

> Jo Keeps me on track<br> :date: __2020-11-19 12:14:08__

> The program itself is great and I'm really enjoying it but the app keeps crashing. I have to keep restarting it which is frustrating when I'm trying to get into a rythmn and flow with my running.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 01:09:53__

> Jo is off putting talking nonsense and making you think its time to stop running, twice now she's ruined my run. So annoying! Only talk when it's time to stop.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:43:51__

> Its great but app keeps on stopping when im using it.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:50:05__

> App is good for workouts and motivation but it does keep crashing<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:38:08__

> Great app but the annoying bell half way needs to be removed.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:18:07__

> It's a fantastic app, really encourages me to get out and I love how clever it is to interact with your music. However the only problem is it crashes 3-4 times each run so I end up walking or running much longer than intended<br> :date: __2020-11-17 11:43:00__

> I absolutely LOVE the actual guide - it has given me the ability to run, which is something I never thought I'd be able to do. 5/5 However, the app itself is incredibly frustrating. Sometimes when I trybto save my runs it just starts them from the beginning, which is inconvenient. Every time I start a new week the app tells me my selected trainer is 'unavailable', and I have to choose a new one. I've cycled through all options now and none of them work for longer than a week! Frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-16 14:36:44__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:59:51__

> App closes randomly during the run<br> :date: __2020-11-15 17:20:26__

> Like the programme, but am finding that when I put my phone in my running pouch/waste belt it seems to pause itself so I have to keep taking it out and I eitherende up running or walking too long! I've tried switching my screen off but somehow it keeps pausing unless I hold my phone which is not desirable when running!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 20:37:54__

> Pretty much the shonkiest app out there, crashes 2/3 times per run and has failed to log the last 3 runs. The principle is fine, the execution is very poor.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:05:34__

> The apps only purpose is to ensure you get a clear instruction to run, or to stop running and walk. I've had to reinstall twice before week 8 because the trainer became mute. My music dips, but that's it.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:34:45__

> Resert a session to start randomly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 20:18:17__

> Keeps stopping and going back to the beginning... Shame<br> :date: __2020-11-13 13:30:55__

> I have the app installed on my Huawei P10 and although I have adjusted the settings as recommended, the app often closes mid run. I also completed up to week 7 with Michael Johnson but now an error message appears and prevents this audio. Since installing the app back in July, I have had to uninstall and then reinstall because of these reoccurring issues.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 11:34:03__

> Idea is great, just finished 2nd run, same as 1st app reset numerous times.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 20:57:57__

> Unfortunately the app kept crashing making it incredibly difficult to use however the features of it seemed very promising.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 10:04:38__

> Keeps crashing on the journey. Spotify plays perfectly and the one you app turns it's self off<br> :date: __2020-11-09 19:48:10__

> Great idea. You had very high hopes of my fitness for the first run but I've kept at it, occasionally walking a running part until I could do it. End of week 4 now and twice your app has crashed while I was running. If I were walking it would be less of an issue but it isn't great when I am about to collapse before I realise I should have stopped running a while ago! Stop the crashing and I'll up you to 4 stars, give me a warm up so I don't damage my ankles again and I'll go up to 5.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:29:34__

> I've used this app in the past and it does the job well. BUT the audio is shocking. Can't hear what they're saying over my music,so am basically guessing I'm stopping and starting in right place!<br> :date: __2020-10-28 22:09:07__

> Dia, continually cuts out. R u b b I s h.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 17:13:44__

> The coach narration/alarms and stuff don't work. Tried listening with music and nothing. Tried without nothing. Not good. Since my last review I still can't hear a damn thing. Got a different app<br> :date: __2020-11-13 10:50:14__

> Didn't really use it<br> :date: __2020-11-12 11:10:10__

> What is that name!? (:<br> :date: __2020-11-12 09:48:11__

> Utterly rubbish, app closes every time I am on the run phase.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 19:14:31__

> The app doesn't work. It starts your workout then stops after 3 minutes. There you are thinking you have done s good job and it hasn't been doing anything. Pointless app. If I could give no stars I would.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 22:22:50__

> How am I supposed to run 5k?! I'm 4 stone overweight and can't even run upstairs. This is for Olympic athletes not ordinary out of shape people! And how am I supposed to afford trainers and gym gear when I'm out of work due to the coronavirus? Do an app that helps people lose weight not kill themselves running marathons.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:57:36__

> Broken and frustrating app, works for 5-10 mins then it stops and closes the app with out warning. I've double checked the settings on my phone to make sure it's set right but still doesn't work. Plenty of other apps that do C25k I'll try them<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:10:51__

> Terrifible experience. Used it for the first time, built up the confidence to go out and the app kept crashing or the audio didn't come over the music. It was raining so I couldn't keep getting my phone out to restart it so after about 30 minutes (in which time I had only got about a quarter of the way through due to keep stopping to re-boot the app) I gave up and went home. Unfortunately it seems all the one star reviews are for the same thing so it must be a common problem.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 19:27:29__

> Really wanted to love this app as it's really clean and well designed, but I just can't get voice instructions to work. The music dips but there's no voice, so you have to keep looking at your phone. Not sure if I'm missing something or if this is the design of the app (or just a bug on my phone, Pixel 3).<br> :date: __2020-11-01 19:08:23__
