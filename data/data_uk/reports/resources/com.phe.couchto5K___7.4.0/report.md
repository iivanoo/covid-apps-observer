In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> A fantastic app to get you moving and does what it says on the tin. Choose your own motivational coach and away you go! only reason it doesn't have a 5 star rating is because occasionally it would drop out part way through but other than that fantastic. Thank you<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:54:39__

> Good so far<br> :date: __2021-03-06 10:16:22__

> Enjoyable<br> :date: __2021-03-05 16:32:56__

> Really helpful support & motivation to keep going 😀<br> :date: __2021-03-05 15:37:29__

> Enjoying it coaches are good and keep you going<br> :date: __2021-03-05 07:45:14__

> Good experience<br> :date: __2021-03-03 18:01:05__

> I enjoyed the app struggled a bit towards the last week but managed it all very pleased<br> :date: __2021-03-03 13:07:36__

> Perfect for someone who wants to get iníciate in this habit. Cuts to the point, 30min guided sessions, no fancy high technical parameters to distract, just you, your coach and music if you fancy it. Get some good shoes, an upbeat playlist and give it a go, you won't regret it (but careful with the rest and what your body tells you)<br> :date: __2021-03-03 12:59:40__

> Easy to use. Great motivation tool. You can listen to your music while following your coach. So makes the run more enjoyable. Having a coach while running, adds a personal touch, as if you were running with a PT. I have just started the program, reason why I only gave 4 stars. Glad to have started!!<br> :date: __2021-03-02 23:21:58__

> The app is good to follow and I generally feel better, but it doesn't run in the background for my phone. It does tell you and I think it says how to fix it but Im no good with technology so I just use it as a guide and run through the workout after a jog.<br> :date: __2021-03-02 11:46:24__

> I really like this app, it's an excellent way to start running, see real results and make yourself feel good. But it's very buggy? Sometimes the clock will freeze and won't count down properly meaning you run or walk longer then you should.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:11:23__

> Great app but crashes all the time which is really frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 10:03:03__

> Regularly have to download the voices again for some reason. The old app was simple and crashed less.<br> :date: __2021-03-04 09:32:54__

> Basic prompts could have some encouragement and indication of 3/6 of your runs etc.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 19:36:23__

> Trainer keeps going back to the start.<br> :date: __2021-02-28 09:32:58__

> I find this app a bit 'basic' so good if you dont want it personalised and just want something to keep time while you run. I also find I have error messages frequently and have to keep changing coach voice.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:54:07__

> Wd have liked to see distance covered in time spent<br> :date: __2021-02-25 15:27:15__

> Overall a nice app, the podcasts are positive and concise and the goals are manageable for a beginner at running. There are some irritating issues though, mainly involving it sometimes failing to cue up - sometimes I just find myself running and running, knowing full well I've run for well over the full amount of time but not having been told to stop yet. Sometimes the podcast runs perfectly in the background but sometimes it fails randomly, despite all my phone settings seeming to be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 01:10:54__

> Good workout, however it doesn't tell me when my cool down walk is finished or save my progress at the end of each run<br> :date: __2021-02-22 15:02:22__

> Good exercise program, got me up and running. App constantly crashes recently, not sure if there's compatibility issues with Strava but it hasn't worked properly for the last couple of months<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:34:54__

> I love the concept of the app, but when it crashes it's garbage. Also there's no way of syncing your data, if you get a new phone you lose your progress.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 13:32:08__

> Whenever I use something like spotify the run stops i have been on 3 walks now and it thinks I've done 0<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:10:23__

> Cuts out<br> :date: __2021-02-24 21:37:55__

> Great concept, however crashes every time i use it so unable to use as intended.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 16:32:15__

> I'm sad to give this such a low review. Because if it worked properly it would easily be the best app available for this. Unfortunately no matter what I do or how I alter the settings as soon as the screen is locked and the phone is in my pocket this app stops working. It requires my phone screen to be unlocked and the app to be open in order to work and that simply isnt compatible with running. I hope they fix it because as I said if it's working properly its way above all other alternatives.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 13:19:25__

> Good at first and helped me get running but the app was constantly crashing. Ended up using the plan but not the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:14:57__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> It's a great concept and I enjoy using it for the most part but I am sick and tired of the app crashing mid run. Edit - 8/2/21 still crashes mid run. Absolutely useless!<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:00:46__

> Got the app last weekend been out on 2 runs inbetween gym sessions and on both runs the app has just stopped!<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:28:50__

> The audio does not work when i start it, despite changing the settings. Had to resort to putting the times on my fitbit as an interval workout. Seems to be a common problem wity Huawei phones.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 13:01:02__

> Great idea but doesn't work. I have done 3 runs on one run the program just shut down and on the other run it shut down 3 times in the run and I had to re start it and skip ahead to where I was. I will try a different app if the next run doesn't work. Please sort this out, it's extremely disruptive. Thank you<br> :date: __2021-03-03 09:23:00__

> Not a good start. Sarah Millican has always been annoying, can't stand her voice. Other options no better. Can we have more trainer voices please 🙏<br> :date: __2021-03-02 20:35:55__

> Terrible, clicks off when your phone locks or when u open another app<br> :date: __2021-03-01 15:20:40__

> Supported by the BBC. Okay, I'm out.<br> :date: __2021-03-01 00:38:14__

> App doesn't work and won't open<br> :date: __2021-02-27 22:45:03__

> Booring<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:01:04__

> Often doesn't work when pairing with wireless headphones. Will start your music, start the run and instead of the trainer there's nothing at all<br> :date: __2021-02-23 23:17:38__

> Keeps cutting out mid session<br> :date: __2021-02-20 20:27:04__

> I can't hear any of the coaches. I have tried deleting and redownloading, freeing space on my phone... Just doesn't do much! Having to manually time my runs which is much less fun. Any advice appreciated for android/google<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:44:43__
