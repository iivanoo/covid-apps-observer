In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Simple, easy, motivational. Could add a distance /route tracker to make it perfect<br> :date: __2021-01-29 17:59:08__

> This is the second time I have used this app. The first time took me from no running to a marathon in good for age time and this time I am recovering from an injury and it is great to curb my enthusiasm so I take my recovery steadily. I think it is great.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 17:15:55__

> Very motivational. Easy to use. I am enjoying it.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:12:41__

> Great app It's got me going<br> :date: __2021-01-29 15:17:32__

> Although I'm only on week 5, I can't believe how well this works, especially for someone like me who has never run before and doesn't exercise.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 14:16:52__

> I'm now a runner!!! All thanks to Couch to 5k!! I could barely manage 2minutes jogging when I started but now I can do 30mins+, really great for people who want to get into running but don't know where to start 🏃‍♀️<br> :date: __2021-01-29 13:34:17__

> Just 1 week in but really motivational and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-29 13:03:08__

> easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-28 22:17:32__

> Brilliant app to get you running for the first time<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:09:41__

> The app has been very helpful and is keeping me on track. I'd give it five stars if the coaches weren't so repetitive. They all sound so bored.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 23:54:15__

> Use strava along side to track distance. Helped alot.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 21:17:24__

> The app is great and I love having Jo Wiley chat me through!<br> :date: __2021-01-27 20:19:47__

> Struggled to run for 60 seconds at a time at the start, completed the program this morning with a 5.5mile run. The app could be improved by having a different voice over for each run rather than same one for the full week and some runs wouldn't allow my chosen person so had to change a few times but on the whole these are minor grumbles.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:29:34__

> Good but cant get music to play , help!!@🤣<br> :date: __2021-01-26 07:41:30__

> Great app. Some issues with stopping if using multiple apps at the same time (i.e. watching Netflix whilst running!) otherwise would have been 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-01-25 20:45:59__

> I like it & it's helping me jog/run. And it's building my statmina<br> :date: __2021-01-25 20:36:33__

> When the App is working it is fantastic. I've managed to get to wk 3. However keeps crashing and not logging the run.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 00:22:08__

> Stopping talking to me halfway through !!<br> :date: __2021-01-28 21:32:47__

> Excellent, basic, but with annoying flaws. I recommend this, but it is so annoying when the app tells you a run is complete, but all record of it is then lost as you haven't manually saved it. Then having reminder alarms to run going off while you're running is just silly. Five starts with a bit more thought in usability.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 08:02:44__

> There's good points to this app - the timer page and run breakdowns, but it often seems to not work smoothly and almost every time I have to change my trainer selection for some reason!<br> :date: __2021-01-24 09:30:36__

> Keeps asking me to reassign a trainer. Other than that..when I do have a trainer it works well, motivating...etc etc all good very encouraging..<br> :date: __2021-01-19 19:16:51__

> App is great to start running but as soon as my screen turns off the app stops counting time.<br> :date: __2021-01-18 11:50:52__

> Great but it doesn't save my repeat runs only the 1st run I ever did on that run. I have done about 4 runs on week 3 and it still shows only the 1st run I did 4 months ago! I am having to use other apps like Strava or my fitness watch to see my history. This seems like a very basic thing to fix?!<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:59:59__

> Very glitchy. Closes randomly even with recommended settings<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:02:02__

> It got me through the program. Did often crash during the run leaving me with no voice guidance to stop. So some runs went on extra long! This happened repeatedly on the final 3 runs so I'm nearly at 10k distances now.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:01:34__

> Clear guidance and great for anyone who does little or no exercise to get started! I've put 3 stars because the app kept freezing.... Had to switch to a different app but if you don't have this problem then I'd recommend it!<br> :date: __2021-01-12 22:33:41__



#### 2-star reviews

> The app closes itself after a short time, so I can't listen to music while using it, I have to keep my phone open and move the timer to where I think it last stopped. Very annoying. It loses my day every time, putting me back to day one.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 08:26:42__

> Great plan but shocking how much it crashes in the middle of runs. Will delete and try and find a better app that actually works.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:04:25__

> The concept is good, but the app itself is fairly poorly written and has multiple issues. It loses the coach audio causing you to reset it. It has bugs that causes it to lose focus and thus lose the audio mid run. It has crashed a couple of times and has also stated that it needs more storage (100mb) when over 100 GB is free on both SD card and internal storage. The actual couch 2 5KM is an excellent approach and am really enjoying it. The app whilst bug ridden is usable on a run by run basis<br> :date: __2021-01-24 18:45:46__

> Downloaded on to a Huawei & it doesn't work during workouts when background closes, you have to keep opening & fast forwarding it to continue the workout or you could be running/walking for hours.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:00:28__

> Keeps out half way through the run.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:14:51__

> The timer stops working or lags when your screen goes black and I ended up walking much more in the beginning as a warm up than I should have done and was running for much longer than I should have been. Therefore, even though the concept is great, it really didn't work as I didn't have any structure to follow in the end and might as well just run at my own pace.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 00:23:14__

> Keeps shutting down on honor 10 even after settings change<br> :date: __2021-01-10 14:09:52__

> I started using this app again but it'd cut out on me several times and had to use a stopwatch instead and no progress logged<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:04:53__

> I like the app and love my coach Michael Johnson. But it stops mid run on EVERY SINGLE RUN, rendering itself useless. Very very frustrating. It would also be good if the coach pep talks varied from run to run (rather than week to week) in the early weeks.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:17:12__

> I had heard good things about this app, unfortunately the app cuts off quite frequently and this is really disheartening when you are in the middle of a run. If they get this bug fixed then I would give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 21:06:48__

> Keeps cutting out half way through . Deleted it and download again but still does the same<br> :date: __2021-01-29 19:18:10__

> Plan is good, but app keeps disconnecting<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:02:47__

> It's changed. I used it last year and it was brilliant but now it stops during the warm up walk and I end up walking for longer before I realise. Then I have to restart the app, find my place and start again, only for it to repeat. I would love to keep using it as I found it to be really beneficial for me.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 20:07:49__

> Nothing happens when I hit Go. Sometimes the timer will count down but no audio. Tried shutting all other apps down, reset app, restarted phone. Very glitchy! Something must be up as it's worked on my phone before.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 00:29:47__

> App always stops<br> :date: __2021-01-22 17:18:29__

> Stopped working correctly - it freezes when I start it up. It used to be fine, but the minute I press go, it goes for 1 second then stops. Audio stops, timer stops, it just won't work. Not sure if there's been an update which has messed it up but my phone (Google pixel 3) is up to date. Please fix it, this is my running lifeline<br> :date: __2021-01-21 00:05:01__

> Keeps closing down. Each time Im outside running it stays on for a bit. I think when the Internet connection goes down slightly it just shuts completely and I have to start all over again! So annoying! Does anyone know a better app here? Or is it something tthat Im not doing right?? It shouldn't be so hard... :(<br> :date: __2021-01-20 20:12:39__

> Awful, had to reset it 3 times over the first two runs I did. I've had to guess Whereabout I was in tbe run. I've uninstalled and now going to try a different app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:23:18__

> Can't be arsed.which is an indicator of how boring it is<br> :date: __2021-01-13 15:07:16__

> Very dissapointed my second schedule run and it keeps freezing 😣 11 01.2020 no change app keeps stopping<br> :date: __2021-01-11 21:51:01__
