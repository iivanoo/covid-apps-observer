In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Amazing! Encouraging, easy to build. Love it<br> :date: __2021-02-27 12:07:27__

> Great. The only negative thing is when you get to the later weeks there is no talking for long periods, so if you don't have music it can be hard work!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 12:05:26__

> Spurred on by my daughter, after just 3 days I can feel a positive difference both physically and emotionally. Even at 67 it's possible!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:08:04__

> It's really challenged me but I have really enjoyed it for me I think it's been my me time during lockdown and home schooling something for me to recharge after all my children have gone to bed it's been fun thank you<br> :date: __2021-02-27 10:53:59__

> Just finished week 2. Simple app the works perfectly. Running along with Jo Wiley!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 10:26:40__

> Jo Whiley is fab!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 10:23:45__

> Brilliant way to get started.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 09:43:18__

> Love it! Sarah Millican makes for an encouraging coach, and the programme really works.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 09:15:09__

> This app is really good for novice runners... Never thought I could run for 30mins<br> :date: __2021-02-27 09:08:46__

> The only app that made me run. However, I am missing burned kcal info.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 00:08:07__

> Just getting started and it's even great for complete beginners like me. Feel I am really achieving something.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:39:18__

> Great,easy to follow<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:12:05__

> As user friendly as a running app can get. It is informative for when you are starting out, and tries to keep you motivated with lots of positive encouragement. The addition of celebrities as coaches was a welcome addition. Not 5 stars as all of the coaches go through the same script, and some of the useful advice seems to be hidden behind different weeks. Overall though, very good, would recommend.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 18:57:47__

> Brilliant app.motivayes and inspires, I am.not a runner at all however this allows you to build up your stamina slowly. My only irk is that I cannot hear the trainer<br> :date: __2021-02-24 23:06:15__

> Keeping me motivated<br> :date: __2021-02-24 21:03:01__

> Love having a structure and goals to work to. Would like each day to have a different commentary rather than the same one all week. I think it should recommended that you should be able to do a brisk walk for 40 minutes before you start week 1. If you are seriously unfit it's quite a lot of running.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 20:00:32__

> Does what it says on the tin, though after having it a week I have noticed that one function doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 18:38:02__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-02-24 14:16:24__

> Still week one but still going so a good app!<br> :date: __2021-02-24 13:02:14__

> Enjoying using the app. It has issues loading the trainer of choice but otherwise works well<br> :date: __2021-02-24 11:26:37__

> I find this app a bit 'basic' so good if you dont want it personalised and just want something to keep time while you run. I also find I have error messages frequently and have to keep changing coach voice.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:54:07__

> Wd have liked to see distance covered in time spent<br> :date: __2021-02-25 15:27:15__

> Overall a nice app, the podcasts are positive and concise and the goals are manageable for a beginner at running. There are some irritating issues though, mainly involving it sometimes failing to cue up - sometimes I just find myself running and running, knowing full well I've run for well over the full amount of time but not having been told to stop yet. Sometimes the podcast runs perfectly in the background but sometimes it fails randomly, despite all my phone settings seeming to be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 01:10:54__

> Good workout, however it doesn't tell me when my cool down walk is finished or save my progress at the end of each run<br> :date: __2021-02-22 15:02:22__

> Good exercise program, got me up and running. App constantly crashes recently, not sure if there's compatibility issues with Strava but it hasn't worked properly for the last couple of months<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:34:54__

> Really helped me go from not being able to run at all to going over 7k by week 8. I'm not ever going to be a runner but I feel fitter. It was really annoying that you couldn't always select the presenter you wanted. Also if the phone rang then the app stopped working, and I didn't realise so had to start again!<br> :date: __2021-02-20 18:01:28__

> Sometimes difficult to hear trainer over music. Regularly have to change trainer due to issues<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:19:59__

> V V easy to use. Running time is irrelevant, as distance covered depends upon pace....? But its perfect for motivation! Recommend it, yep!<br> :date: __2021-02-16 22:16:29__

> Great app when it works. I frequently have to reboot the app multiple times before the audio etc actually comes through.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:10:45__

> Somehow, I managed to have 4 copies going at the same time, out of sync. There was no way to stop them. It shouldn't be possible to start it while a copy is running.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:00:41__

> Whenever I use something like spotify the run stops i have been on 3 walks now and it thinks I've done 0<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:10:23__

> Cuts out<br> :date: __2021-02-24 21:37:55__

> Great concept, however crashes every time i use it so unable to use as intended.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 16:32:15__

> I'm sad to give this such a low review. Because if it worked properly it would easily be the best app available for this. Unfortunately no matter what I do or how I alter the settings as soon as the screen is locked and the phone is in my pocket this app stops working. It requires my phone screen to be unlocked and the app to be open in order to work and that simply isnt compatible with running. I hope they fix it because as I said if it's working properly its way above all other alternatives.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 13:19:25__

> Good at first and helped me get running but the app was constantly crashing. Ended up using the plan but not the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:14:57__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> It's a great concept and I enjoy using it for the most part but I am sick and tired of the app crashing mid run. Edit - 8/2/21 still crashes mid run. Absolutely useless!<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:00:46__

> Got the app last weekend been out on 2 runs inbetween gym sessions and on both runs the app has just stopped!<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:28:50__

> The running schedule is great and I'm really enjoying it. Michael Johnson's audio is motivational without being cheesey. I have an Honor phone so the app shuts down part way through a run, apparently there's nothing the developers can do about this. I have downloaded a free interval timer that does the job and runs successfully in the background without issue, and just use the Couch to 5k app for the schedule and to log my runs.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 17:33:40__

> Booring<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:01:04__

> Often doesn't work when pairing with wireless headphones. Will start your music, start the run and instead of the trainer there's nothing at all<br> :date: __2021-02-23 23:17:38__

> Keeps cutting out mid session<br> :date: __2021-02-20 20:27:04__

> I can't hear any of the coaches. I have tried deleting and redownloading, freeing space on my phone... Just doesn't do much! Having to manually time my runs which is much less fun. Any advice appreciated for android/google<br> :date: __2021-02-19 17:44:43__

> Keeps closing down and what was meant to be a positive start became rather frustrating. Will be looking for other apps to use<br> :date: __2021-02-19 11:55:55__

> Keeps cutting out while on runs<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:47:15__

> Not fit for purpose - app stops running when phone closes/locks. But if you keep phone unlocked you cannot put the phone in your pocket or armband as you inadvertently press pause/exit etc<br> :date: __2021-02-11 15:43:16__

> Any tips to prevent this App closing on itself? It keeps happening several times every run<br> :date: __2021-02-10 19:32:34__

> Boring<br> :date: __2021-02-10 11:35:11__

> Horrendous app. Completed first run and the app shut itself off 4 times so had to keep restarting, thought it may have just been a glich so stuck with it for the next two runs, done exactly the same thing!! So off putting, concept is good, shame the app doesn't actually follow suit<br> :date: __2021-02-04 16:37:40__
