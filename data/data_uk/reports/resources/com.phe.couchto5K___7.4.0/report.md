In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Just do it and stick with it. Great app<br> :date: __2020-12-20 19:43:14__

> Great app! Mix with a separate workout music app is a great touch!<br> :date: __2020-12-20 19:14:37__

> Love Sarah Milican telling me what to do! Feel like I'm progressing at an achievable pace<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:57:09__

> This is my third use of couch to 5k. Succeeded each time but didn't continue for long after I finished. Running now with my daughter and hope to continue regularly once I finish the 9 weeks. Listening now with Jo but have to say Laura has the edge.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:45:46__

> Absolutely fantastic. Didn't think it was possible! Progress was slow and steady making it totally manageable.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 15:40:18__

> Amazing app. In October i was 93kg and couldn't run for more than 1 min without getting out of breath. I've lost weight down to 84kg and now enjoy running 30 min three times a week. It's been a challenging but great experience.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 13:53:06__

> Before I started this I couldn't even run for 30 seconds, I thought I hated running, brilliant app for training you to run for 30 minutes. Really recommend!<br> :date: __2020-12-20 13:30:12__

> I liked the fact I could go back and repeat a week or weeks if I had a break due to illness or holiday. Never thought I would be able to run for 30 minutes and I will soon be 60!<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:03:20__

> So far so good! Finished week 2 and determined to keep going x<br> :date: __2020-12-20 01:55:55__

> A great way to start (or re start) running!<br> :date: __2020-12-19 23:52:46__

> Reliable app works well<br> :date: __2020-12-19 18:15:15__

> Finding it easy to follow, getting us off to a good start, one of the trainer voices doesn't work on my phone, no big deal.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 22:50:07__

> Great program, small bugs in app.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 17:54:20__

> Step by step, for someone who doesn't run I found this really good.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 01:48:17__

> I LOVE this! The coaches are kind and encouraging, I just finished my last run and did 5 whole k!!!! That was unimaginable weeks ago, please try it if you want to get fit or start running! Only thing, it crashes a couple times if you exist the app by accident or an alarm goes off. Not too bad though! Nice!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 16:42:33__

> I found the app really helpful to keep to the weekly targets. I had to change my 'coach' after week 3 as my phone wouldn't let me continue with Michael Johnson. So I chose Jo Whiley and glad that I did. Was good to be able to play music too..just remember to put it on first before opening couch to 5k. Although I've managed to run for 30 mins now I'm a bit slow and not reached the full 5k so at least have that now to set as a target.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:34:10__

> A good running app with plenty of motivators and ability to use with music. Only shame can't see speed and distance covered.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:24:47__

> Generally very good but it did drop out a few times during a run so had to restart<br> :date: __2020-12-12 10:11:11__

> Easy to use and plays over music app.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 15:38:26__

> Very good for beginners as it builds you up slowly. Only minus is it occasionally stalls in the middle of a run. But mostly very good.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 15:04:00__

> More comentry during run and walk sessions like countdown would be good<br> :date: __2020-12-17 16:08:08__

> Starts off well but it's so frustrating that it crashes or stops working mid run!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:44:52__

> Good but it shuts down when running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:11:11__

> Worked well for the most part, but the app was prone to stopping mid-run; after an ever-lengthening period of silence it was demoralising to check and find that all the progress was lost. I took to using a backup stopwatch after the first few instances of this. The motivation comments were ok, but disappointed that in Weeks 8 & 9, each of the three days were exactly the same recordings; not at all inspiring and a bit cheapskate. Anyway, I achieved what I set out to do, so app successful overall.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 12:20:07__

> Good app but times out a lot if your phone screen does not stay active. Also not good at tracking real time. My phone timer was more useful. But a great intro to running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 11:32:55__

> Good to start with but once you got to the weeks you have to do long runs like for example 5mins non-stop if the phone screen goes to the sleep the app would crush and if you go back to the app it takes you back to the beginning in the middle of your run which was too stressful at times<br> :date: __2020-12-11 17:10:09__

> Nothing to signal that I've completed runs when I have, not sure if this is a bug. Also keeps bringing up a message to say I need to select a different coach as the one I have selected is unavailable.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 21:40:21__

> The app was amazing to start with but over weeks 8 and 9 it has been crashing and losing progress shortly after the 10 minute update every time I run. This has been hugely frustrating. I am so glad I was using Strava too or I would have lost my place / progress completely. In the earlier weeks I found the app really effective. It's a good build up and the encouraging messages and updates through the running really kept me going.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:55:53__

> Would be 5 stars if the sound worked!!<br> :date: __2020-12-05 15:43:45__

> Good programme but app keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-04 13:48:44__

> The app is a great idea and well thought out. Having a coach is nice and I like that it has a reminder feature. However, the app consistantly crashes at least twice during a run. Not so bad when you are on a walking session, but particularly annoying when you are running. I have set the recommended power settings for my phone but it still crashes. Also it often asks me to reset the trainer as the audio is not available or my phone is out of memory (not true).So nice idea if it worked properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:26:39__

> I was really pleased with this app however on week two it lost all of the sound (the instructions) which quite frankly makes it useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference. A real shame!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:46:07__

> I love the guides running, however the app simply doesn't work properly. I have changed the settings to manage manually multiple times yet it always stops mid run. Whenever you reopen the app, you have to start the run all over again. Please fix this, it's a real pity.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 15:49:04__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> The programme is great and the app worked brilliantly over the summer when I first used it. I'm not doing the programme again at a faster speed and I'm having problems with the app asking me to reset the trainer because I'm out of memory (not true) and resets the trainer every time I go out. Please can you review for bugs. Also this time there must have been an update as the podcast no longer stops the background audio when the trainer comes on. This is annoying as I miss patches from the audio.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:59:00__

> This app wouldn't work with headphones and so everyone around you can hear it.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:45:47__

> The plans are great I love that I can listen to my own music.. but... This app keeps crashing it can happen 3 to 4 times a run meaning you loose track of where you are. It happens every time my phone locks and its very demotivating. Please fix soon!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:10:02__

> Terrible why do I have to have some "celebrity" talking to me. I just want to complete the programme on my own. Why is there no option to turn the voice off. Usual bbc rubbish.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 00:09:57__

> Constantly crashes<br> :date: __2020-12-10 08:08:26__

> Keeps turning off, need to restart app. Does not work with my Spotify.<br> :date: __2020-12-10 07:37:08__

> Doesn't work for me on android using Spotify. I get the first couple of directions, then silence.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 10:59:33__

> I used this app on my Huawei P10 Lite and it worked amazing. I'm about half way through the 9 week programme and I got a new phone for my birthday, a P30 Pro, and it doesn't work. In the help section it doesn't list my phone or it's EMUI so it doesn't look like it's compatible with the newer versions. Hopefully they will update the app at some point. It's so disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:46:44__

> app keeps crashing mid run. waste of time<br> :date: __2020-12-02 20:12:29__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run. It never completes a run now. At least I do.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 20:00:50__

> Crashes unexpectedly constantly and therefore making it pretty unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:02:15__

> Originally gave this 5 stars but for the last few weeks it has crashed mid-run without warning, leaving me running and waiting for the coach to tell me to stop! I'm looking for a more stable alternative.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 18:01:36__

> Very good<br> :date: __2020-11-23 15:29:32__
