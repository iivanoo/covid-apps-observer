In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat W, version 4.4W - 4.4.4W (API level 20) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When I skip the 40odd second intro, it jumps to 2.30 minutes saying "you're half way through you 5 minute warm-up". Other than that, works as intended.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 17:02:30__

> Apart from having to change coach almost every time, the app is fine. I'm enjoying using it. It's quite straightforward.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 19:44:12__

> It keeps me focused as I progress on my run.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 10:06:12__

> The whole C25k plan is incredible - it's taken me way longer than it should've but I'm still so impressed with my progress. BUT, this app needs work on androids. I have to change my settings so the screen doesn't sleep otherwise the app just closes. Sounds minor but it is so annoying, I almost don't trust the app so I'm always checking.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 00:28:02__

> Good app. I like the coaches they tell you when to run or walk.<br> :date: __2021-01-14 19:12:50__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-01-13 22:14:28__

> Pleased with results would love to track distance/ pace in same app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:03:41__

> Good app to get you started<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:03:40__

> Pretty good. Unfortunately has a bit of tendency to crash in the middle of the run<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:22:49__

> Very good. I recommend joining the support forum too as there is lots of advice and support. You don't have to fit the programme into just 9 weeks.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 16:25:08__



#### 3-star reviews

> Great but it doesn't save my repeat runs only the 1st run I ever did on that run. I have done about 4 runs on week 3 and it still shows only the 1st run I did 4 months ago! I am having to use other apps like Strava or my fitness watch to see my history. This seems like a very basic thing to fix?!<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:59:59__

> Very glitchy. Closes randomly even with recommended settings<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:02:02__

> It got me through the program. Did often crash during the run leaving me with no voice guidance to stop. So some runs went on extra long! This happened repeatedly on the final 3 runs so I'm nearly at 10k distances now.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 19:01:34__

> Clear guidance and great for anyone who does little or no exercise to get started! I've put 3 stars because the app kept freezing.... Had to switch to a different app but if you don't have this problem then I'd recommend it!<br> :date: __2021-01-12 22:33:41__

> Yes it's good<br> :date: __2021-01-12 17:27:00__

> It is a brill app and has successfully managed to get me to run 5k However the app sometimes stops working and shuts down on you. Helpful to set a timer in background just in case.<br> :date: __2021-01-12 01:11:28__

> Good but would like more encouragement !<br> :date: __2021-01-11 20:02:30__

> Timing seems out compared to my device. Seems to pause if not constantly open<br> :date: __2021-01-10 13:16:12__

> Undecided but will attempt to stick with the programme for time being<br> :date: __2021-01-08 17:44:06__

> I've used the app before and got up to week 5 before stopping. I recently started again. PROBLEMS: The mid run notification no longer sounds, which is a bit annoying. The notifications I set in the app to remind me to go for a run do not appear, despite the app having notification permissions. Also, the integration with Spotify is poor; sometimes the app pauses the Spotify audio then doesn't resume it once the coach has finished speaking, other times the coach just talks over the audio.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 14:00:10__

> Keeps shutting down on honor 10 even after settings change<br> :date: __2021-01-10 14:09:52__

> I started using this app again but it'd cut out on me several times and had to use a stopwatch instead and no progress logged<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:04:53__

> I like the app and love my coach Michael Johnson. But it stops mid run on EVERY SINGLE RUN, rendering itself useless. Very very frustrating. It would also be good if the coach pep talks varied from run to run (rather than week to week) in the early weeks.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:17:12__

> I had heard good things about this app, unfortunately the app cuts off quite frequently and this is really disheartening when you are in the middle of a run. If they get this bug fixed then I would give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 21:06:48__

> The app is a great idea and well thought out. Having a coach is nice and I like that it has a reminder feature. However, the app consistantly crashes at least twice during a run. Not so bad when you are on a walking session, but particularly annoying when you are running. I have set the recommended power settings for my phone but it still crashes. Also it often asks me to reset the trainer as the audio is not available or my phone is out of memory (not true).So nice idea if it worked properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:26:39__

> I was really pleased with this app however on week two it lost all of the sound (the instructions) which quite frankly makes it useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference. A real shame!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:46:07__

> I love the guides running, however the app simply doesn't work properly. I have changed the settings to manage manually multiple times yet it always stops mid run. Whenever you reopen the app, you have to start the run all over again. Please fix this, it's a real pity.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 15:49:04__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> Awful, had to reset it 3 times over the first two runs I did. I've had to guess Whereabout I was in tbe run. I've uninstalled and now going to try a different app.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:23:18__

> Can't be arsed.which is an indicator of how boring it is<br> :date: __2021-01-13 15:07:16__

> Very dissapointed my second schedule run and it keeps freezing 😣 11 01.2020 no change app keeps stopping<br> :date: __2021-01-11 21:51:01__

> Not impressed, the timer wasn't accurate in the slightest. Supposed to start with 60 run and 90 second walk alternating but the app simply couldn't keep time. I ran 2 and a half miles in around 24 minutes and the app said there was still 17 minutes left of running. It was only supposed to be a 20 minute run. Not great when you're a beginner trying to get fit.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 18:14:43__

> Never been able to do it as it crashes all the time as soon as I go in to the app.<br> :date: __2021-01-10 21:37:09__

> It crashes every single time 😩 sometimes it'll last 5 mins before it crashes, sometimes its only a minute. Not good when you're running and don't realise it's happened, which happened to me 😂 a bit useless really, and can see I'm not the only one. PLEASE FIX THIS as Apple users don't seem to have the same problems!<br> :date: __2021-01-10 12:56:56__

> Kept crashing!, didn't even get half way through first session, it had stopped working 3 times<br> :date: __2021-01-07 14:43:07__

> Every time I started the first run it would shut down the moment I got a notification from another app despite me having changed the settings so that it ran over other apps. Extremely disappointed. It was pretty much useless.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 08:56:19__

> Used to work ok with an occasional crash now & then but now it just doesn't even start up! If it does, it doesn't work, no progress, no audio. What's the point of an app which doesn't work on the latest Android version?<br> :date: __2021-01-05 12:18:49__

> App just shows blank white screen. If you manage to get past this, the app crashes either on main run screen or partway through runs, so then you lose your progress. Really disappointing. Please fix this.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 11:12:59__
