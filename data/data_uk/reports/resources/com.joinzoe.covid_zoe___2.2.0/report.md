### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app, helping to identify early. It reminds you every day to report back on your situation which will hopefully lead to early detection by digital means rather than pure physical testing<br> :date: __2020-12-28 11:48:04__

> Unable to add a further test. Restarted phone, restarted app, but still claims that I need to 'please scroll up to fill in missing details or correct'. There is nothing to fill in or correct! I have previously added 6 tests without a problem. Is this an issue with the recent update? Otherwise, happily logging my (absence of, so far) symptoms on a daily basis...<br> :date: __2020-12-28 11:40:38__

> Efficient and regularly updated, the app is clear and easy to navigate.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 10:13:48__

> Simple, helping the fight against COVID<br> :date: __2020-12-28 09:18:43__

> Great project 👍<br> :date: __2020-12-27 19:37:28__

> Uninstalled etc but Ive been unable to add new test for last two days - I've filled in the fields and just asks me to add missing data or correct.... Now based on symptoms been asked to take a test by the app... App issue or user error?<br> :date: __2020-12-27 18:53:01__

> Reminders have disappeared<br> :date: __2020-12-27 17:14:24__

> Logging in isn't straightforward<br> :date: __2020-12-27 16:09:02__

> Has worked well for the most part but have been unable to report the result of an antibody test: I fill out all the sections and it says there's missing information and I can't submit, I have to just say I haven't had a test.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 13:30:49__

> Update 27/12/20 Aside from a short term reminder issue in November, the app has been working well, but there's currently a glitch with test reporting so my data has been incomplete since 23rd December. Original Review Spring 2021: Good to feel you are making a contribution, however small, by using this. Like the daily reminder, & link to the website for more information on the study etc.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 13:02:18__

> I can't input my latest test - the app tells me to correct the information but it is correct and nothing is missing<br> :date: __2020-12-28 10:39:59__

> I've been logging daily since the app launched, but since the update I no longer get daily reminders and so often go days without remembering to log - apparently to be a known fault but have been unable to resolve.<br> :date: __2020-12-28 00:25:43__

> It is confusing with the one which does identify you, track and trace and all that I do not want<br> :date: __2020-12-27 22:21:46__

> It's a must to keep on top of the virus. It won't let me log my test 😭<br> :date: __2020-12-27 11:42:59__

> This app was great, I could log all my tests (regular tests from work) but as of yesterday I've just been getting a white screen? Uninstalled and installed again but still the same..disappointing. Update: I can get back on again, but unable to scroll down my tests to update results :/ Update:sorted now. 26/12: now unable to add test since 23/12 keeps telling me to scroll up to fill in missing details..no details missing<br> :date: __2020-12-26 12:13:22__

> Will no longer let me input test results<br> :date: __2020-12-26 11:42:48__

> Good but too many clicks every day! Wheres the 'I'm fine' shortcut? Also data must be skewed, only very cautious people would bother with this app.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 14:22:02__

> This morning when I select "this list is correct" for previous tests, it immediately goes on to ask me whether I have any issues with the vaccination site I have not had a vaccination and did not indicate that I have.<br> :date: __2020-12-25 08:42:34__

> Excellent idea and I really want to help but it does seem a bit buggy. Currently can't log a Covid test as it keeps telling me I haven't filled in all the fields - I have!! Also reminders keep turning themselves off.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 21:15:38__

> I can't use the app anymore. After logging in the app displays only a white screen. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, the same.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 15:22:49__

> COVID data for my region is out of alignment with PHE and worryingly the app shows a fall of ~500 from last week and PHE showing a rise of 158 (~39%). True the figures shown widely disagree but the trends should be consistent. The app appears to be making the area looking better than national statistics suggest. Is there a way to get the app to show both?<br> :date: __2020-12-28 08:12:31__

> HELP! I've been logging every day but today after the 'splash' screen I just get an empty white screen and I can't do anything. Tried killing the app and restarting, uninstalling and re-installing but still no luck.<br> :date: __2020-12-24 12:11:50__

> Won't let me enter previous Covid test info so can't use app. Obviously bug in it or an issue with my One Plus 6 phone??<br> :date: __2020-12-23 19:09:33__

> Was working great. But since your latest update, all I get is a blank screen when I log on<br> :date: __2020-12-23 11:32:00__

> As another user says I am getting the white screen every time I try to log in - only from today, but as I have logged in every day and I am sure others do the same and probably now have the same problem..,. Please help us to help you<br> :date: __2020-12-23 10:27:42__

> Accidentally clicked that I had a covid vaccine in the app when I haven't and can't find a way to remove it. This is stopping me from report my symptoms without first reporting vaccine symptoms, which I'm not going to do. Please introduce a way to remove this.<br> :date: __2020-12-21 07:45:29__

> Sort out the issues or else I won't be bothered and will delete the app<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:14:34__

> I recently updated the app and now it will not load. Great before, quick and easy to log your health! But now I am faced with a white screen instead.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 10:36:05__

> Worked ok until 19th December when it just showed a blank screen after loading. Same after updating. Shame but this type of app must be 100% reliable to be useful. Uninstalling<br> :date: __2020-12-20 08:20:34__

> I have no trouble sharing anonymized data, but personal traceable data is right out.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 05:57:39__
