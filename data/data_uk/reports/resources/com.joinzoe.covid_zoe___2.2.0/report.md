### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Simple and straightforward to use.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:42:05__

> Very quick and convenient way to report any symptoms of covid19 and see cases in your area and across the county. New information shared by Tim and the team detailing the range of symptoms is handy. Feels good to feed scientists some helpful data. Share this app to help out.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 23:54:28__

> Quick and easy but when I logged my vaccination the app didn't ask which type I had received<br> :date: __2021-01-23 12:11:10__

> Generally good, but can't update to my new postcode area<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:25:18__

> Runs better than it used to at the beginning. And every person using it helps the cause.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:25:41__

> The only recommendation I would make is to give more choices to where the test is given. Mine was given in the parking garage in a medical specialists building.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 15:54:24__

> Show the curve straight after data is entered not after returning to the first screen<br> :date: __2021-01-22 14:17:43__

> Works well, although comparing it with display my brother has on his. Mine is missing displaying the count of active cases in my area on the graph.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 13:49:11__

> Great app quick and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-01-22 12:13:39__

> Great except notifications have stopped working so forget to report daily.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:10:03__

> I was locked out of the app for 2 months - until I bought a new phone. The app was updated and I was unable to get the update to work on my phone. Some aspects of movement through the data entry are not clear e.g. enter test details and then how are you supposed to move on.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:59:28__

> Been technical problems but rectified quickly. Easy to use and a lot of information on the site.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 08:28:21__

> Ever since the last update, I have been unable to get notifications working again. Also I've noticed people mentioning graphs??? I've never seen a graph.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 22:36:27__

> Reminds me to update but sometimes I have to uninstall it then reinstall again<br> :date: __2021-01-22 20:37:27__

> It doesn't ask about my positive vivid diagnosis? And it's not very intuitive<br> :date: __2021-01-22 18:19:16__

> I have had issues with the app on the last two days with it failing to recognise my account. Yesterday I reinstalled it. Last week it was fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 12:08:33__

> Stopped working today. Crashes upon loading.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 12:02:07__

> This is a great app that's easy to use and displays research data very clearly. I gave it 5 stars initially but recently notifications have stopped for no reason<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:11:23__

> Had worked fine until 20th January. Now a blank screen. Unable to log on. No reminders received.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 06:58:35__

</p>

> My first vaccine date disappeared .<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:53:26__

> A giant missed opportunity. With the urgent need for better evidence on effective preventative or treatment options, why not collect data on a wide variety of products and practices while infection rates are so high? Any substance or routine correlated with lower infection or disease severity rates can then be prioritised for investigation. For example, N acetyl cysteine, quercetin, turmeric/curcumin, Nasal spray compounds or lavage, oestrogen, progesterone, daily hours slept, etc.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 15:26:26__

> I am unable to report a problem with the app anywhere else, so I'm doing it here: recent update has added a mandotory blood group question before any other reporting options. I don't know my blood group, so cannot report! There is no option to skip or to choose "I don't know"<br> :date: __2021-01-16 16:54:02__

> The app had been working fine for over a week but currently freezes with a white screen. Not sure how this has happened, please fix the bug?<br> :date: __2021-01-16 10:56:55__

> I don't know what good this is doing, there is no feedback, info is all one-way. The app just freezes sometimes. The developers should try using it to find out the issues. Bet that will never happen. Now the app just says "loading". Tried stop/starting it. Who wrote this rubbish?<br> :date: __2021-01-13 20:45:49__

> App not downloading properly now.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 10:08:19__

> It's a good idea, but the app has continuous problems.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 22:09:45__

> I am frustrated because I kept being asked to repeat my report. I have an aÃ±droid phone and I followed your advice to reinstall the app ensuring it is the latest version. I am NOT going to do that anymore and to that end I will not be reporting my status for a week to allow you to SORT this. Many, inclÃ¹ding those involved in deciding how we are all to live our lives. Your study group use our reports to develop models, which may be skewed by additional reporting.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 17:57:57__

> Clear well thought out APP just need more people taking part. Or at least it was until I am now trapped with a white screen and seemingly no way of fixing it.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 09:27:18__

> It used to give me daily notifications to fill out the form but this stopped few months ago nothing I do can change this. Not sure if this is just me or others having the same issue.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 21:06:28__

> Since endeavouring to update the app I have not received a daily notification even though my app states Installed. Such a pity as I have updated daily throughout the pandemic.<br> :date: __2021-01-22 19:29:38__

> Suddenly stopped working<br> :date: __2021-01-16 12:03:09__

> This app worked well untill it was upgraded now it does not work on android the same . You struggle to give responses ha ha,the questioner doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:15:45__

> Today my oxygen levels good my palate is sore and my nasal cavity feels horrid everything still tastes awful walking in bungalow flapping my arms started to cook for myself<br> :date: __2021-01-15 20:03:50__

> Was reporting daily since March till the daily reminders stopped. On the advice of some of the reviews here, having not reported for about 4 months now because I have other important things going on in my life, I deleted the app thinking that would fix it and now can't login again. No password reminder emails received. This app is broken.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:24:10__

> Doesn't show correct information in my area. Prof Whitty state infections increasing but your app shows them falling. Poor performance.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 17:27:57__

> Edit: the missing figures issue has been resolved but now the graphs are missing from the week/month breakdown (just appears as a blank box). App has been missing the last digit off figures for over 2 months now. Sent screenshots to the developer 3 weeks ago but nothing has changed. E.g. 234 cases in my area show as 23.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 16:32:43__

> Useless junk. Stats are wrong. Crashes. Was working yesterday to a point but now unusable with just a white screen. Yesterday the graph showed a decrease in cases but the text stated an increase your information is a joke. Tried reinstalling , no difference , uninstalled, not wasting anymore time on this.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 21:23:55__

> Informative and reassuring, great app, a couple of months on and now the app is just a white screen, unable to open, please fix<br> :date: __2021-01-06 11:04:54__

> Stopped working 05 Jan 2021. Tried to uninstall then re install no good.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 19:22:08__
