### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomasâ€™ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Easy and quick to report each day. Good to keep in touch with the situation in my area and with Tim Spectre's weekly review.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:38:46__

> Glad to help.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:37:36__

> Annoying that I cant change profile details. Also it disconnected me so had to reinstall find/create new log in<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:35:23__

> Originally very quick and simple to use. It is now more complex with the use of logins. It has also stopped asking about activity rates.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:07:46__

> Great app, simple to use and very interesting to have local area data. It helps me make sense of the news.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:05:56__

> Usually works well, with occasional glitches.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:50:27__

> Very easy to use app. Good for updates about the results. Glad to be helping the science and understanding of this disease. When I first joined this study all I was asked was whether I'd had a fever and cough. I might have had this in February. Glad to see that the list of symptoms and the detailed questions are much improved.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:39:49__

> Not sure why but this app has stopped sending daily reminders, so I've gone from entering daily to it being 3 or 4 days before I think about it. But it's a great idea and handy tool.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:34:48__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:05:12__

> Worthwhile and informative<br> :date: __2020-11-23 08:21:26__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">
<img src="3_star_reviews_wordcloud.png" alt="com.joinzoe.covid_zoe 3 reviews"/>
</p>

> The app is quick and simple to use but sometimes seems to fail to record daily input and displays an inaccurate "last report" date. On the occasions that additional information is requested the wording of questions limit input from those outside the demographic options.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:01:31__

> The app 'forgot' me for a while and resetting the password was not as straightforward as it should be. The 'login' function seemed unresponsive at several points. But overall it feels like a good way to contribute to the understanding of where this virus is heading, so I have stuck with it.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:16:46__

> It helps me feel connected but I'm not sure how<br> :date: __2020-11-22 13:43:07__

> Easy and quick to use. Now mostly warns if there is no connection. However if connection is later lost whilst reporting symptoms, this is not reported. \*\*\*\* Version number shown on menu screen is stuck at 1.0.0, actual version is now 2.0.1 \*\*\*\*<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:56:13__

> This app has worked well and I have reported most days for several months without a problem. But in the last week, there have been problems logging in, being asked for a password when it already should have it. Then the last few days, the page has loaded to report and then gone blank before I am able to click the report button. I have uninstalled and reloaded the page several times and finally, was able to log in. Will persevere because I trust this app and believe it is worthwhile.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:44:20__

> Generally good and important info collector - however daily reminder to do is not reliable and for some reason had to log in again recently despite using it nearly every day.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:13:24__

> When trying to find the outbreak numbers in my area I find the maps are inadequate, very few names of boroughs, and illegible but can't zoom in sufficiently.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 00:34:22__

> Doesn't always record my daily visit, then needed logging in again.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 22:15:01__

> I think you should be asking about daily interactions and mask wearing, visits to places and relatively risky behaviors. I think you should be including political affiliation and source of respondents news about covid. Perhaps you should ask about their religion and whether they gather in church groups, whether they abide by local quarantine restrictions.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 19:26:32__

> Following a recent app update the push notifications have stopped so I have to remember to update daily<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:36:28__



#### 2-star reviews

> Used to be great and I felt good to be part of helping research. Unfortunately, about a week ago the app disappeared from my phone and I had to reinstall and login which I'd never done previously. And now, this new version doesn't remind me to report either so I quite often forget. Perhaps the Zoe team don't need my input anymore? Not too sure if it's worth keeping to be honest.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:16:18__

> Since last update I was logged out (and had to faff about resetting password) and then logged back in. Now I no longer get any notifications to remind me to update. Well done for the update and my entry is so sporadic now as I often forget to update.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 15:15:17__

> There is no facility to show that I had an antibody test not an antigen test which was positive. So now your data looks like I had covid twice. I had it in march with no test. I had positive antibody test in June and a positive antibody test eight months after the illness in November. Your results will be skewed of the data of antibodies and antigen tests is put in the same question<br> :date: __2020-11-21 11:48:54__

> I fill in the questionnaire every morning, the icon shows that I've done it today, yet later I get a notification and when I check in the app it says I haven't done it, so I do it again. This happens every single day. Apart from today, when it said i hadn't contributed for six days. Which is not true.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 00:29:29__

> When I missed out recording a day I could not get back into my account in spite of having an accepted new password.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 18:49:46__



#### 1-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> No longer reminds me at all, as a result my posts are sporadic. Get it fixed.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 19:36:32__

> Since the last version installed 2 days ago app crashes whilst loading. Quick fix please.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 00:59:22__

> Not interested in adverts - this app has lost its way.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 22:36:49__

> Change log says only "fixed push notifications". So how come there is a whole slew of invasive permissions added with this update? Phone ID, GPS, Contacts, Calendar, Microphone, Camera etc?<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:30:19__

> Since the recent update, the daily notification to report has stopped. My phone notifications are on and the app notifications are also on.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 22:04:34__

> No request to update today.....something wrong with app?<br> :date: __2020-11-20 19:18:03__

> Push notifications are not appearing anymore (last 6 days) so I forget to input my data. Really frustrating as the reminder meant I had missed only a couple of days since downloading the app in April. I have missed 4 out of the last 6 days now. I've checked my phone settings and there's no reason the notifications aren't appearing.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 15:50:52__
