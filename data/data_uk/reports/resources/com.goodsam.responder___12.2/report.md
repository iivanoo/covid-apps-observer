## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Never had an issue with the app. I use the OHCA responder as not signed up for the NHS voluntary scheme. One glitch I do need help with. I cannot upload photo or position if a community defib. Have tried on 2 phones. Both have location and tags unlocked. But no joy. Any ideas. For those below who are not happy with the app. Keep trying. Be patient. This app has saved lives around the world. It was a steep climb for the design team to go from out of hospital cardiac arrest to what it is now<br> :date: __2020-06-12 12:32:12__

> Appreciate your helpful response - sadly my area is not on the list but I noticed the link for registering my interest in case it is added in the future. Thank you and all the best<br> :date: __2020-10-08 19:52:04__

> Please give us a volume control for that dreadful siren<br> :date: __2020-09-26 15:13:11__

> Well after not bothering to log on much over the summer due to never being called on, I received an email saying more people were needing help. Plus I felt I should do something to say thank you for early access to the Track and Trace app. I logged on half an hour ago and just had my first call! She's already received help from a neighbour but was very grateful for the call.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 11:51:16__

> The app work good. But the notification siren (which I am not able to change) puts me off. Think about a loud siren in the middle of a restaurant, quite house/work place. Ability to choose between a couple of notification tones/ringtones will be of great help. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-08-20 12:13:07__

> Seems to work fine, gives plenty of information. Has been disappointing the number of requests that have come through though. Maybe it is a good thing and very few locals need support during the Pandemic.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 14:54:44__

> Up until yesterday it worked fine but now I can only get my initial screen with photo. I can't get page with on/off options (on duty / receive alerts etc)<br> :date: __2020-06-19 11:26:09__

> The app is decent enuff but there phone-in workers are ridiculous 🙄 rude to a point of where they lie to your face over and over and over and if u don't write all the info down on paper say goodbye to any refunds<br> :date: __2020-06-16 09:39:42__

> Well built app<br> :date: __2020-06-09 23:10:33__

> Embarrassingly loud notification<br> :date: __2020-06-06 22:04:39__

> I have had alerts, accepted job, contacted person and yes help required. Rang surgery for collection of prescription and was already collected. Some time previous, so why had alert come through after collection. Needs more info as to progression of job. i.e Accepted, collected, delivered maybe? Good idea though.<br> :date: __2020-06-04 14:04:22__

> Not enough room to write in here what needs addressing as it's limited to 500 letters and spaces I'd barely touched the surface on what needs sorting and ran out of space, but there isn't enough information or user functionality in the app we need a lot more communication options in app with a more detailed description to assist with dealing with failed calls not being answered by the people that are in need plus a lot of other options and also an in app guidance and helpcentre<br> :date: __2020-12-10 11:08:18__

> Like others have said, I have an issue with the siren. I am a petsitter and it terrifies some of the cats I am visiting. I did ring and complain about this. I ended up turning it off the weeks. I have just turned it back on. Two alerts I accepted. First I keep ringing so dropped the job. Another had already arranged for someone to take him shopping. Now I have just got back the alert I dropped earlier and still no answer. The alerts are not reliable.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:46:36__

> Good app but siren way too loud, it's driving my neighbour mad ! Apart from that, as others say here, 90% of people I ring have no idea why I rang, or how or why somebody put them on list. That needs addressing . On top of that some of the alerts are days old ,their prescription or shopping done days ago.Im becoming a bit disheartened wasting my time every day. I'm more than happy to run around for folks but less happy with wasted calls<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:11:24__

> Doesn't work. I try to register using my St John certificate and the swirl of doom just spins foreverrrrrrrr; by which I mean 20 minutes over WiFi. Was able to register via the Web then log in to the app. But app registration just did not work.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 22:19:48__

> I've responded a couple of times to find that the chat request was for the previous day and had been dealt with? Embarrassing and unnecessary and the siren is excruciating why not a special phone sound kinder on the ears<br> :date: __2020-11-03 13:24:23__

> The app is ok however this Sunday I received 6 requests in quick succession. All bar one needed no help, and most requests I get end up being no help needed. My main criticism of the app is that once an alert comes in it sets my notification volume to max. I don't want or need to be notified each time normal messages come in which is why it is set to mute. Please can you make sure the app doesn't change my notification settings<br> :date: __2020-10-09 21:17:20__

> I am getting alerts but am unable to accept or reject them, have reinstalled app as advised by volunteer helpline & this has made no difference.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 15:18:13__

> App works well, though it does not always record your time. Cannot make contact with any app designers to help resolve the problem. Tried a re-install but it didn't help.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 14:13:43__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2020-08-16 21:21:10__

> Worked perfectly before the update.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 18:58:39__

> App is ok but no way to check back on previous messages. I responded to a call from a gentleman who needed shopping tomorrow. I agreed to do it and then toggled the app to show "responded" as soon as I've done that then previous messages dissappear and I now no longer have address or contact details to sort this out tomorrow!!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:00:32__

> My app ppears that it doesn't work I havent had any alerts, and I can't change my organisation<br> :date: __2020-11-25 21:44:29__

> Still unable to upload photos of new AEDs locations to the GoodSAM app. I've replied via email and awaiting your reply.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 23:07:53__

> Not contacted very often. Sometimes people dont need any help.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 09:37:32__

> The alerts work for a few weeks then the siren stop and I'm not notified of an alert. It just says in comma you missed an alert. So frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:27:38__

> Very poor for something so important. Clumsy, bad layout, adding an AED is broken. Come on, this app is IMPORTANT. Sort it out. (Reply to developer - Yes I have checked both of those settings and it still doesn't work. No reply to 4 emails requesting help either)<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:39:03__

> Only just come back to the app...but now i know why I deleted it! The siren is just too loud! I have to have my phone on silent now to stop it going off. I can understand why it was there during the apps initial use, for first responders calling to medical emergencies, but check in and chats or collecting groceries and prescriptions are hardly medical emergencies that need to be completed that precise minute. I cannot have my phone on silent constantly, so think I will have to delete it again...<br> :date: __2020-11-10 10:38:35__

> Goodsam can u explain as to WHY today their was a serious cardiac arrest which happened litrally 2mins from where i live....why wasnt the alarm raised and i could of potentially saved this old gents life,but because nobody knew were the nearest defibrillator was,by time ambulance etc got to him he had passed away...This absolutely breaks my heart because i could of saved this gent potential, but was not alerted.....its a disgrace really is....<br> :date: __2020-11-04 00:24:36__

> When volunteering in SE London I get a lot of requests which are 4-8miles away. This is too far in a city and unnecessary given the number of volunteers that must be available (e.g 15 within a few hundred yards of me). I therefore waste a lot of time with the siren continually blarring and rejecting 9 out of ten requests before accepting a request within a reasonable distance. It should be easy add a setting so that requests beyond a certain distance are not referred.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 17:04:53__

> App is obviously for a good cause, but I keep signing myself out as off duty to avoid the ear splitting notifications (which are unaffected by muting your phone) 3x a minute for requests that are way out of my range. Needs location restrictions and notification adjustments ASAP!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 16:46:43__

> All this good will from the public is thrown away by an app that is next to useless. When alerted people have no idea why I'm phoning, their data doesn't match up with the message and the message is often hours/days old although the alarm has just sounded. What a waste of people's willingness to help in this crisis.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:52:18__

> Bug in google play. Services<br> :date: __2020-12-08 19:41:19__

> Worked fine for quite some time and yet now, no requests are coming through and nobody knows why. Have reinstalled etc but no joy.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:42:23__

> I can't believe you can't adjust the volume on that siren, deleting it.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 01:04:08__

> I have received many alerts but was able to respind to only one as the alarm no longer works on my phone, although it does if I simulate it.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:58:20__

> I'm afraid I won't be using the app. The siren is, as the previous reviewer stated, ear splitting. I'll volunteer through a local organisation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:30:41__

> Opens to register but thats as far as it goes, fill in my details and hit register and nothing happens, the little wheel just goes round and round<br> :date: __2020-11-01 19:45:27__

> Completely unusable. When you get an alert, there's absolutely no indication as to what you're supposed to do, and no way to contact the person needing help.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 18:32:29__

> I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location. I'm in London so I am sure there are people nearby that I could help but as is I am not seeing them. Please fix this!<br> :date: __2020-10-09 18:28:42__

> I am receiving alerts from miles away.. sometimes even different cities, which are more than 200 miles away. 😒<br> :date: __2020-10-08 18:22:35__
