### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | SPOTTERON |
| **Website**  | [https://www.spotteron.net](https://www.spotteron.net) |
| **Email** | office@spotteron.net |
| **Physical address**  | [Faßziehergasse 5, 1070 Wien](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Faßziehergasse%205,%201070%20Wien) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
