## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Evergreen Health Solutions Ltd |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> works alright most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:03:58__

> Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:15:46__

> All good<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:24:23__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:54:37__

> The app is very good, but my surgery currently uses very little of the functionality. So it's a lot of screens for just prescriptions.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 11:44:05__

> still slow, and not user friendly<br> :date: __2020-12-14 10:21:55__

> Wont let me get on to log in<br> :date: __2021-03-09 18:33:29__

> fairly easy to use but the app is a bit unstable - slow at times and some screens don't load on 1st or 2nd attempt<br> :date: __2021-03-05 21:46:12__

> Tried to access my medical records. I just get a message telling my they can't link to me GP practice. Not tried anything else with this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 11:40:19__

> It's OK, but the biometric login fails every time<br> :date: __2021-01-26 09:52:00__

> Not a bad app. a bit glitchy but OK.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:23:33__

> Even after making a note of my password, it still told me it was wrong. The last few times I've logged in I've had to set up a new one. Not the best app in the world<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:50:24__

> good app but was simpler to use in earlier versions; a bit cumbersome UI, the most popular shortcuts (e.g. repeat prescription) are not immediately obvious.<br> :date: __2021-01-05 18:34:24__

> every so often I have problems logging in but on the whole its good<br> :date: __2021-01-04 11:04:40__

> Awful, only use it because I have to.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 17:26:45__

> The app no longer loads up, I used it to order repeat prescriptions now it won't do anything<br> :date: __2021-02-13 09:41:43__

> Seems to not ever load the prescriptions section which was the main reason I got it.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 00:17:09__

> Cannot get on the app, click forgotten password, get emailed code, enter code, and it asks security question, answer question and get message too many failed attempts, account temporarily suspended, come back a month later, and get same message on first security question answer, so just how long is your idea of temporary?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 20:15:59__

> does not work correctly. the screen for ordering prescriptions never loads, so i cant order anything through the app. ive had this problem on my s8, s10 and now s20. i spoke to customer service via email and they didnt help at all and the issue is still not resolved. avoid<br> :date: __2021-03-06 23:14:16__

> So buggy.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 21:52:37__

> Why anyone would download this is beyond me!!! I can do all the things this app claims to do, on the NHS Patient Access app. Without having my confidential information being viewed by who knows??? No thanks<br> :date: __2021-02-27 18:54:27__

> Cannot log on. Password never recognised and biometric logon never works. I have had to delete the app and reinstall it, add a new password (same as the old one) and can then order repeat prescription. That happens every time I need to reorder. Have reported the problems to the admin of the app but problems persist<br> :date: __2021-02-08 13:26:22__

> Rubbish app. Cannot access any information recently üòï. Its supposed to make GP access easier. Its such a pain.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 09:56:33__

> Won't connect to GP practice, so of no use to me. I tried asking on "live chat" but just got an automated referral to changing gp practice - not what I wanted to do at all.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 08:40:33__

> Was good at first but now seems more concerned with getting you to fill in stupid health questions than keeping it simple to follow. Always takes me a while to find out where I order repeat prescriptions.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 18:59:10__

> Support staff are wonderful, patient but latest app is not easy to navigate & when I finally manage to find where to order medications, I get repeated notifications about the message box having 'special characters' even when it's blank. Seriously, I've wasted hours on different days reloading the app, try typing a sentence or removing it. I've only a few days of meds left. I've tried again, done exactly the same & got error notification & leaving then coming back, it's accepted! Bizarre<br> :date: __2021-01-07 14:48:17__

> Just got worse, all I want is to access the GP services, I don't want any of the other bloat! The latest update has turned documents from the doctors into a html link! Now I have no way of saving a PDF copy which was the feature I used the most. It hasn't fixed the size problem, trying to print to PDF gives 13 pages for a few page document, not even changing the paper size to A2 works! Definitely on my list to change services to an alternative access method.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 12:30:50__
