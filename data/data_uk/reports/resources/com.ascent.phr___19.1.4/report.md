## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Evergreen Health Solutions Ltd |
| **Website**  | [http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk](http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Works well. Limited functionality - presumably due to government and surgery constraints<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:06:27__

> bit slow today - edit: It is thankfully back up to speed today, though it means I'm unable to make a physical recording of it.<br> :date: __2021-03-09 10:40:38__

> Had problems logging in, but Evergreen helped solve that problem. Thanks guys!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:56:40__

> I find the app easy to use and so far have not had any issues.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:59:39__

> works alright most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:03:58__

> Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:15:46__

> All good<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:24:23__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 08:02:02__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:54:37__

> The app is very good, but my surgery currently uses very little of the functionality. So it's a lot of screens for just prescriptions.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 11:44:05__

> hard to log in with biometrics<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:41:35__

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

> Wont let me get on to log in<br> :date: __2021-03-09 18:33:29__

> fairly easy to use but the app is a bit unstable - slow at times and some screens don't load on 1st or 2nd attempt<br> :date: __2021-03-05 21:46:12__

> Tried to access my medical records. I just get a message telling my they can't link to me GP practice. Not tried anything else with this app.<br> :date: __2021-03-03 11:40:19__

> It's OK, but the biometric login fails every time<br> :date: __2021-01-26 09:52:00__

> I have not upgraded yet<br> :date: __2021-01-24 01:21:17__

> sat<br> :date: __2021-01-11 13:20:41__

> Not a bad app. a bit glitchy but OK.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:23:33__

> Even after making a note of my password, it still told me it was wrong. The last few times I've logged in I've had to set up a new one. Not the best app in the world<br> :date: __2021-01-06 13:50:24__

> Awful, only use it because I have to.<br> :date: __2021-02-14 17:26:45__

> The app no longer loads up, I used it to order repeat prescriptions now it won't do anything<br> :date: __2021-02-13 09:41:43__

> Terrible! I'm always having issues on this app with accessing my medication and ordering it. It has caused me so much stress and has very negative impact on my mental health!<br> :date: __2021-04-13 00:29:39__

> Cannot get on the app, click forgotten password, get emailed code, enter code, and it asks security question, answer question and get message too many failed attempts, account temporarily suspended, come back a month later, and get same message on first security question answer, so just how long is your idea of temporary?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 20:15:59__

> does not work correctly. the screen for ordering prescriptions never loads, so i cant order anything through the app. ive had this problem on my s8, s10 and now s20. i spoke to customer service via email and they didnt help at all and the issue is still not resolved. avoid<br> :date: __2021-03-06 23:14:16__

> So buggy.<br> :date: __2021-03-05 21:52:37__
