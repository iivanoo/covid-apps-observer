<br>‚Ä¢ Stay informed with 24/7 access to your GP medical record, including test results, immunisations, allergies and medications üìÅ
<br><b>ONE HEALTH RECORD. WHEN YOU NEED IT</b> 
<br>It may come as a surprise but a central record of your health doesn‚Äôt exist - your GP, hospital and other healthcare records aren‚Äôt joined up and information is not necessarily shared between them. That can make things pretty tricky, having to remember important information from memory, and explain past treatments and conditions over and over. With Evergreen Life, you can be in control and keep all your health data, including all of your GP records, in the palm of your hand - building a fully accurate and up-to-date record that you can carry with you all the time.
<br><b>WHAT‚ÄôS YOUR WELLNESS SCORE?</b>
<br>Your Wellness Score can help you understand if you‚Äôre doing all you can to stay well. The score is based on your answers to the app‚Äôs clinically-researched Wellness Checks in areas such as fitness, happiness, sleep and diet. By discovering your Wellness Score, you‚Äôll get personalised and practical insights into ways you can optimise your health and wellbeing.
<br><b>MEDICATION REMINDERS</b>
<br>Give yourself one less thing to worry about. Never forget to take your medications again with the Evergreen Life medicine app, helping you safely manage your own or your family‚Äôs health üíä
<br><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER</b>
<br>Track your health and fitness measurements, including blood pressure, body fat percentage and blood sugar levels, so you can monitor your health goals üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<br><b>SECURELY STORE YOUR DOCUMENTS</b>
<br>If you struggle to find appointment letters or your health information is difficult to manage, storing all your documents in one app can make it much easier to organise your care üì©
<br><b>SHARE WITH THOSE WHO MATTER MOST</b>
<br>Get the best care possible and give peace-of-mind to your family or health providers with secure access to your shared health information.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Evergreen Health Solutions Ltd |
| **Website**  | [http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk](http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> works alright most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-02 23:03:58__

> Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:15:46__

> All good<br> :date: __2020-12-30 21:24:23__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:54:37__

> The app is very good, but my surgery currently uses very little of the functionality. So it's a lot of screens for just prescriptions.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 11:44:05__

> still slow, and not user friendly<br> :date: __2020-12-14 10:21:55__

> straightforward and useful app<br> :date: __2020-11-30 22:57:14__

> It should be more simple than it is. Asking many confidential questions and information.???<br> :date: __2021-01-02 22:45:40__

> Works but confusing and sprawling<br> :date: __2020-12-28 10:56:23__

> bio security does not work fingerprint works on all apart from this the most important one<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:56:14__

> Was a good app to check, history, make appointments and order repeat prescription. But lately I can't log on keep saying password or login is incorrect. When I reset password it works from the email link. Also would be good if e-prescription pharmacy could be set when requesting prescription so you don't have to leave a message. If log in and prescription issue fixed would be happy to rate 5 star üò™<br> :date: __2020-12-18 01:11:37__

> sometimes when they make changes, you have to spend time searching for the prescription ordering tab,which should be the most prominent thing on the site, not on a sub page<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:41:11__

> not as good as it could be ,why no way of uploading documents other than pictures and why not visible to members of the surgery by default?<br> :date: __2020-12-02 13:30:55__

> when I try to make an appointment it just says no appointments available ‚Äî always. Prescription ordering works fine.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 18:28:27__

> not easy for seniors to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:46:23__

> when I want my prescription delivered,only comes up with only one pharmacy which I dont want to use,l prefer to use my local one<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:31:51__

> doesn't allow to log in<br> :date: __2020-11-27 23:48:59__

> Too many irrelevant pop up links when logging in making it difficult to get to the bit I need (repeat prescription). I can get through them but others may struggle<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:54:02__

> difficult to use<br> :date: __2020-11-27 10:15:40__

> Unstable keeps telling me to log on when I already am keeps crashing<br> :date: __2020-12-07 21:24:34__
