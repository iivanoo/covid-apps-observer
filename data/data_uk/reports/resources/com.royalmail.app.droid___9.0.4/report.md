## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Cannot be beat<br> :date: __2021-07-04 12:43:28__

> It works for me, for the functions I use.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 09:55:35__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:18:18__

> room for improvement but, highly useful<br> :date: __2021-06-26 10:51:14__

> it works well it's really good being able to c where your package is.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 08:39:17__

> Great! Gives all info and enables you to add preferences. Only issue is no redelivery history, and no option to add picture of alternative safe drop-off space. Cheerrss<br> :date: __2021-06-19 22:12:07__

> No alternate delivery instructions permitted<br> :date: __2021-06-15 19:28:08__

> Logs me out almost every time which is frustrating, on a few occasions transactions have failed yet I still got charged for postage. No email confirmations or anything. It is easy to use and navigate through but its somewhat buggy and needs a bit more stability in regards to making payments and logging in.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 01:56:41__

> Simple and straight forward, however having to manually add your sending address for every parcel is more hassle than it should be<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:13:38__

> I don't know what is going on with this app,is give me this message.... the session expired..please login again,if you are not use the royal mail app for a while, everything else is working without any problems,please sort out this problem,thank you<br> :date: __2021-06-28 23:31:36__

> Good. ..<br> :date: __2021-06-18 00:29:05__

> Keeps saying sorry you've logged out on start up. Just simply ask for log in<br> :date: __2021-06-15 10:53:58__

> OK, but not live tracking like many other delivery companies.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 09:58:56__

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> It is OK, but sometimes the tracking isn't updated and when booking a redelivery it says it is still pending<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:24:40__

> please sync across all device for undelivered "recorded mail" search history<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:22:04__

> Had a parcel redirected to local post office on Thursday so I could collect Saturday . Got an email saying that it would be their , so went do at 10 o'clock an the reference on the email is not recognised by post office .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 12:19:24__

> Tracking never works! only ever tells me that an item has been delivered. Also now have to login everytime which is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 10:35:05__

> Does not work on my Samsung<br> :date: __2021-06-30 08:55:33__

> Very poor app I have had parcels delivered but the app says sorry we have no information on this delivery try again tomorrow? I've also tried tracking a new delivery only to get the same message I've used this app for a very long time now but since the latest update everything has gone down hill. What good is a tracking app that doesn't track.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 11:59:08__

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> A little tricky to navigate, card received for a parcel but with no tracking number, nor anyway of getting feedback eg:with an online help assistant, which would be enormously useful.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 14:41:16__

> Trying to re book a delivery and when you have to confirm at the end all I get is an error message. The app is rubbish it doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:11:28__

> Tries to go through send process but everyone I tapped confirm button it would open the same page again<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:07:13__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Forcing you to register to track items. You can only track 2 items without registering. Completely annoying. 1 star I would give 0 if I could.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 11:16:32__

> "An update will be provided only when we deliver your item". Tracking - we've heard of that...<br> :date: __2021-07-01 23:52:33__

> Absolutely useless<br> :date: __2021-07-01 18:46:49__

> cant deliver on time<br> :date: __2021-07-01 16:51:51__

> Garbage. Tryed to register account. Says my email is already registered. Okay so i request to change password to my email address but no email arrives to change it. Useless from the get go just like the postal service. Had no mail all week. Numerous items paid for are in limbo somewhere within the service.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 16:03:36__

> Will not let you log out<br> :date: __2021-06-30 14:32:32__

> Unable to even log in... useless<br> :date: __2021-06-30 14:26:56__

> Does not work with QR code as instructed<br> :date: __2021-06-29 16:58:24__

> Very poor,doesn't track your parcel always saying the same thing no information on this item until we try to deliver,after delivery it still says the same thing complete pointless app<br> :date: __2021-06-29 09:04:42__

> What a total waste of time this is! I wouldn't trust these developer's to knock up a pot noodle.<br> :date: __2021-06-29 00:06:49__
