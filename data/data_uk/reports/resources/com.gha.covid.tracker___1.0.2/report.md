### Description
> The Beat COVID Gibraltar app is for the citizens of Gibraltar and uses the bluetooth technology on your phone to track other phones you have been in close proximity to. It uses the Exposure Notification Service and you will be notified directly if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. Likewise, if you are tested positive for COVID-19 yourself, those you have been in close contact with will be notified.  
<br>No personal data will be stored or used.  
<br>This app is totally anonymous and no personal information will be logged or shared with anyone. 
<br>Join the fight against COVID-19 and download the app today. 
<br>Beat COVID Gibraltar has been developed by the Gibraltar Health Authority and HM Government of Gibraltar.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> This app is really easy and fast and doesn't have too much of an impact on your battery life<br> :date: __2020-08-18 01:16:04__

> Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:12__

> Waste of time ! Doesn't seem to do anything at all, who said that it was for UK, and why should something developed by and for Gibraltar have any relevance for the UK ?<br> :date: __2020-08-08 17:35:31__

> What does this App actually do? It doesn't seem able to access surveys they send you emails asking you to complete? Why can't the App itself actually ask you?<br> :date: __2020-08-07 11:07:46__

> No instructions on how it works<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:03:07__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? ü§∑üèª‚Äç<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

> This App is not designed for th UK, it is designed only for Gibraltar the app is useless, contact the developer like i did, UK citizen you will be told we can't use it in the UK üá¨üáß This is their response "This App has been developed specifically with Gibraltar in mind. It is open for download by anyone, including cross-frontier workers and persons who regularly visit Gibraltar. If you are not in Gibraltar (whether residing, working or visiting) this app is of no real use to you"<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:25:30__
