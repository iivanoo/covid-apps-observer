### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | everyLIFE |
| **Website**  | [https://www.c19control.com/](https://www.c19control.com/) |
| **Email** | support@c19control.com |
| **Physical address**  | [A1, East Wing, Cody Technology Park, Ively Road, Farnborough, UK, GU14 0LX](https://www.google.com/maps/search/A1,%20East%20Wing,%20Cody%20Technology%20Park,%20Ively%20Road,%20Farnborough,%20UK,%20GU14%200LX) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
