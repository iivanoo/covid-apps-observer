### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
