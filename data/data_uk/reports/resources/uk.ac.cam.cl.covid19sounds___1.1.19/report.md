### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
