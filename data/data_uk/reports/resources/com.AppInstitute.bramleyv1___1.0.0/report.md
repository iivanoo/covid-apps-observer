### Description

<br>- econsultations: reviewed by a GP or Nurse Practitioner once submitted who will get in contact regarding next steps
<br>- face-to-face and telephone appointments: bookable via the login section
<br>- video consultations: visit the econsultation page for more information
<br>- request a referral based: you request will be reviewed by a clinician who will either refer you or make contact to discuss further
<br>- sick note request: use the app to submit a new or repeat sick note request
<br>- medication request: use the econsultation section to order repeat or request new medication
<br>- view your GP medical record: log in to your medical record via the app and view your medical history, previous test results and other health information about you
<br>- health information: read and watch health information 
<br>To use the app, you must be aged 13 and over and registered with one of our GP surgeries. Registering is easy and can be done using the app. As long as you live in England, you can register with us and make us your main GP Surgery which will allow you to access all our online services. If you live more than 2 miles away from our physical locations, you will still be able to access all our services except for home visits.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
