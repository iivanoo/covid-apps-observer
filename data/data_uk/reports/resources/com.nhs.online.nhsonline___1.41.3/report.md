### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Fab<br> :date: __2020-11-26 11:44:43__

> This is the third app I have used to connect to my drs surgery. The first was patient access which worked fine for a couple of years then just wouldn't link. The second was evergreen which let me make appointments and scripts but would never log into medical history for test results. Now I'm on this nhs one. At first it was like the evergreen one but since the update I am really pleased! Its linked in to all parts of the app and I get test results the next day! This is important! Thank you!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 10:49:32__

> Everything in one place, once you sign up. Well worth having<br> :date: __2020-11-26 00:04:08__

> Cool service<br> :date: __2020-11-25 17:10:51__

> Easy to install. I use mine mainly for repeat prescriptions and it works well. No more dropping off pieces of paper. Order online and then collect from nominated chemist<br> :date: __2020-11-25 10:43:24__

> Just what I needed 😷<br> :date: __2020-11-24 19:54:17__

> Issue with accepting conditions of use now resolved. Now able to access the app with no problem 🙂👍<br> :date: __2020-11-23 13:49:56__

> Great app for ordering repeat prescriptions, not tried to book appointment as yet.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 18:38:40__

> Easy to use, shame the historic medical history has to be answered every time you need to contact your GP<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:28:33__

> Second time lucky, first time I installed the app, I got the unresponsive white screen others are reporting. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled the app and all seems fine now, the proving of my identity worked fine too.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:19:44__

> I didn't seem to have the same difficulty putting in my I d and personal details as everyone else seems to have. Using app I can see my prescription and my allergy, cannot book an appointment due to Co vid. Was hoping to view test results, but still waiting for gp surgery 4 weeks on. Helpful for ordering repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:24:54__

> Access your medical records and order repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 10:40:19__

> Easy to oparate.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 23:45:48__

> I've received an alert to say I have to self isolate as I have been in close contact with someone, but I haven't, last week I went to the doctors (who I called and are okay), a fish & chip shop to collect food, I wear gloves and touch nothing, & I popped into the co-op, in all cases I was not close to anyone, why have I been sent the message ?? Edit.... thank you for your note, sorry, I will contact the website you have suggested 😊<br> :date: __2020-11-17 22:06:03__

> App works absolutely fine for me. Uploaded all information using android phone. Requires NHS checks / approval based on id submission which is understandable given the personal data you'll be able to view. Having 10 digit NHS number to hand probably helps with ease of registration. With the app itself I like what I see.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 10:05:36__

> 2nd Update.. No issues installing the app and verifying my details. Able to order repeat prescriptions without issue. Unable to book/view/manage appointments which the NHS help desk advise me is due to my surgery disabling the function and not the app. In summary, everything working as it should it seems. Any problems reported are looked into and answered within a couple of days. Happy so far, will be happier when I'm able to book and view appointments. Thanks NHS for your efforts.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 11:31:17__

> Rubbish Won't let me prove my identity. Uploaded photos of Driving Licence and Passport. But doesn't like my video of the four numbers. Won't work with Microsoft Edge plus camera nor from my mobile phone. I already have the covid app and I try and support the NHS as best I can. But surely my taxes pay for better than this?? :( EDIT finally registered usin an old browser. At least developer responded quickly. 😀<br> :date: __2020-11-30 12:05:58__

> I can only partly review the app because my surgery are not currently registering people for their online service so I can't really use the app. Very frustrating as the other options are driving to my doctors and posting a request or sending in a request by post. Which with covid being a thing seems absolutely bonkers. I may as well send a telegram or carrier pigeon.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 11:28:05__

> Just ran an update. When I try to "Continue with NHS login", I just get a blank white page that goes nowhere. Updated review. Completely uninstalled app and reinstalled. This worked. Can login again. Upgraded the rating a couple of stars but can't give it more as it didn't work straight after the upgrade. I had used the app to describe symptoms and got a doctor call back within 36 hours from my local surgery. Was easy to use and resulted in a prescription that I could collect within hours.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 21:42:18__

> Could not book Doctors appointment on app<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:07:19__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:40:37__

> Not a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 19:50:50__

> Appears to work<br> :date: __2020-10-30 17:43:00__

> Good app but missing a notification centre<br> :date: __2020-10-29 21:36:45__

> Removed it. Doesn't do anything. Live ruraly and work in a huge office and business park with nobody around. Everyone is Covid kosher following best practice. Had Covid in Jan. This app is several months too late.<br> :date: __2020-10-27 22:27:47__

> Not good. Won't let me order a repeat prescription as it says I have no medication available. I have 5 medications permanently on prescription!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 22:14:00__

> Really buggy, on trying to upload any evidance whether photo or from gallery, the app forgets what its doint and gos back to login page.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 08:46:10__

> Unhappy being forced to accept cookies, even if you choose not to have certain cookies the app will not allow you to continue without agreeing to accept all of them<br> :date: __2020-11-20 12:13:49__

> Can't open app<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:25:17__

> Latest update will not update. Any guidance on how to make it update would be most welcome. N.B. opened the app and found it was still working, therefore that is not the problem.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 13:39:21__

> Over sensenitive. Alerted me 3 hours before self isolation was due to be over. Status had apparently really?! No not yet. Has now though finally.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 08:36:18__

> Easy enough to put on your phone. Big problem I have for the last 2hrs had Internet connection error 😠<br> :date: __2020-11-16 19:01:39__

> My initial review of this was far from flattering. Would NOT allow me to register using passport and video upload. Seems to be a common problem judging by other comments. Avoid this by using the alternative route and get your GP surgery to provide passcodes etc. Having finaly managed to register using these data, the App seems fine but it was a very stressful experience.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 13:26:32__

> I been for day so how can I have been around some one who got it not very good at all<br> :date: __2020-11-11 15:12:07__

> Can't register without a mobile phone. Developer needs to be more objective. Not everyone can afford or want a mobile device<br> :date: __2020-11-09 09:29:19__

> So far I wouldnt recommend this app as I can not get it. On the log in page it asks for your mobile phone number then says it will send a registration number to your mobile. Ok, it did this - but I tried five times and every time I went back with the correct number you app would not accept it - and told me to try again!!!! How can you keep the app open to complete the registration and look at the text it sends you at the same time? I had to close the app, look at the text, go back to the app and start again.....all really annoying!!! surely there must be a better way of doing it???<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:34:01__

> made it impossible to sign in<br> :date: __2020-11-28 22:05:20__

> App keeps forgetting login, and does not integrate with Android password manager or security. Also doesn't load camera for ID verification, so I needed to separately take photos/videos, but the app would reset itself yet again. When Rx renewals expire and require review by GP, the Rx just disappears from app with no message. No reminder to renew Rx, which would be useful. Also, my GP hasn't been receiving Rx renewals or messages, even though appliers correct surgery. So it's useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 16:38:05__

> The app never loads - the loading icon just spins infinitely.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:01:40__

> Having spent 20 minutes establishing my identity, I am told that I cannot use the NHS App because my doctor's surgery has not given me permission to access their services. Useless. The only reason I downloaded this app was because my surgery texted to tell me that I could have a flu vaccination but had to book it via the NHS app. This is a waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:10:31__

> Unable to connect<br> :date: __2020-11-26 12:11:41__

> Terrible app on 2 phones same post code one app says high other says medium.<br> :date: __2020-11-25 15:45:58__

> Update: never had a problem with repeat prescription, now can't order through app and need to contact GP. making this app pointless. Rubbish.. forced to move to this app to continue repeat prescriptions. I am ok with using it. Absolute rubbish for those who are not tech savvy, like folks. In a time were covid still poses a risk and factor in you can't call to order a prescription why, why introduce this??!! Has added stress to family members regarding their medication that they didn't need!!<br> :date: __2020-11-25 01:29:59__

> Won't update, have tried 3 times.<br> :date: __2020-11-24 13:48:12__
