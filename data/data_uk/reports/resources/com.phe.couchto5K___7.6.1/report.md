In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> If I can do it and you want to do it then get on it! Go on surprise yourself<br> :date: __2021-06-10 21:43:08__

> Clear and easy to follow.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 21:26:06__

> Good app, great for beginners. Really easy pace to build up to longer jog/runs. I'm not a runner and at nearly 55yrs I've found this a good assesst. You'll enjoy it.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 13:25:27__

> Works. Feels good. Excellent.<br> :date: __2021-06-10 13:22:05__

> Never thought I would be able to run for 30 minutes, this app is so encouraging, helpful and easy to use and keeps you on track. Would recommend to everyone who wants to start running!<br> :date: __2021-06-10 10:06:44__

> Easy to follow app. Keeps you on track with your progress<br> :date: __2021-06-09 18:32:21__

> Amazed I ran at all, let alone for 30 mins. I actually pushed myself to a full 5k the week after which took 45 mins. Probably need to make clear to users that they probably won't do 5k in the 30 mins time goal unless they are very fast. Should be called Couch to 30 minutes run, really to be more realistic App can also cut out mid run which is very annoying when you are waiting for coach to tell you to slow down etc....Aside from that, it's really good. Thank you. I used Laura.<br> :date: __2021-06-09 07:33:00__

> Fantastic. App so well developed that it can make you into a runner in 9 weeks safely, without injury & making you realise you can become a runner. I have continued for one year having started the app in March 2020.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:59:50__

> Wish there was music included in the runs<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:27:25__

> The only annoying thing is that once the app is running, it disappears on my phone so I can't pause it or stop it until that run is finished. I have had to resort to switching off my phone to stop it talking at me, on a couple of occasions when my plans changed and I needed to do something else.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:21:18__

> Cool but can cut out at times<br> :date: __2021-06-03 21:47:18__

> A good plan very supportive.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:48:33__

> Great way to get into fitness and something new. Sometimes cuts out but could be phone rather than app.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 09:43:15__

> Really good app. Wish it had more voices but loving Sarah Millican. Cuts in and out of my music, sometimes with a delay going back to full music volume but I have figured out a workaround on that. Anywau, great app...would not be able to master running without it!<br> :date: __2021-06-03 07:44:46__

> So good to use with easy interface. Only took star off as occasionally it doesn't save the run you have just done, if you don't save it very quickly. But a brilliant app nevertheless<br> :date: __2021-06-02 22:09:53__

> This app would be great if it didn't keep cutting out several times during your run! I have to add a seperate timer to keep track of how long I'm running for which isn't ideal. The advice & encouragement is helpful though and it's great to realise your progression as the weeks add up.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 09:38:58__

> Was great but now keeps shutting down towards the end of my run<br> :date: __2021-06-06 17:15:17__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs. Finally completed the couch to 5k app, really helped me get fitness up<br> :date: __2021-06-02 21:33:32__

> Never thought I'd be running for these distances & times. Also never thought I'd enjoy running! App programme is excellent & having Michael Johnson egging me on helped haha. EDIT: lowered to 3 stars as you appear to have removed Michael Johnson.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:04:41__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:26:33__

> Keeps crashing every minute and a half so I can't use it at all.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 13:53:53__

> Works perfectly on an iPhone, pretty terrible on a Samsung galaxy.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 03:34:32__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> So far on week 3 going into 4 I feel more confidence on finishing each run. I am hopeful that the next few weeks will be as positive on both my mind and body.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 10:47:42__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Great if you only want to listen to music. But the second you play a podcast it pauses when you start your run. Zero options to change this.<br> :date: __2021-06-06 11:19:45__

> Doesn't save my runs and stays on first page so I can't see how I'm progressing through the run I.e what's coming up next ? Mins walk/ run<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:26:43__

> Awful app that is totally unreliable and continously cuts out whilst in use, rendering its existence totally pointless.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 13:10:33__

> Downloaded 3 times but app freezing at the "let's get started" page. To tech support to sort it out!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:49:04__

> Did run 1. Tapped on run 2 the next time, but played run 1. Managed to get it to play run 2, but only recording that I've done the first run!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 00:01:32__

> After downloading the app... the app wouldn't move past the "Ready" screen. Even for me as an utter couch potato expected that I was going have to do some sort of exercise!<br> :date: __2021-05-18 21:05:43__

> WHERE HAS MICHAEL JOHNSON GONE?!!!<br> :date: __2021-05-15 11:25:44__
