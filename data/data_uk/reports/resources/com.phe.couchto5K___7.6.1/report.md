In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Amazing! Cannot believe I can now run for half an hour without stopping; I followed the programme to the letter and thanks Sarah Millican!<br> :date: __2021-05-30 12:13:32__

> Ideal App. Simple, clean, clear, easy to use, effective. Run for max 30 mins just 3 times a week and in 9 weeks you will be able to run for half an hour...I think that's pretty cool:) You can easilly play your own music and whenever the coach speaks it auto adjusts the volume. Great experience all round:)<br> :date: __2021-05-30 08:50:02__

> Loved it so helpful got me running haven't run for about 30 years brilliant app<br> :date: __2021-05-29 14:31:58__

> Genius! Just set aside about an hour three times a week to get changed, warm up, go out, come back, have a banana (good for the heart), drink some water, warm down, shower or whatever. Lo and behold... athlete!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 09:16:51__

> Simple but an excellent app. I would definitely recommend it 👌👍❤️<br> :date: __2021-05-29 08:02:53__

> Motivational Easy to use and step by step increases your running ability. You go at your own pace and get some great tips. Highly recommended<br> :date: __2021-05-29 07:16:26__

> Really good app. If I can do it, anyone can. Sarah Millican coaxed and encouraged me to running 5k without stopping!<br> :date: __2021-05-28 23:58:31__

> Absolutely brilliant got me off the couch<br> :date: __2021-05-28 23:04:05__

> I started Couchbto 5K journey after finishing treatment for cancer & thought at first I would not cope. Bit, the gradual steps really help & I noticed my fitness & running stamina get better. I had Jo Wiley as my coach & as she has completed this programme, her instructions are clear.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:32:36__

> Fantastic - everyone out there give it a go<br> :date: __2021-05-28 10:56:33__

> Its achievable. I hate running but this app keeps me trying to improve my fitness.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 18:34:48__

> Very easy to use and providing the on-the-ear there & then support so you don't have to think about how to set or direct the session...you simply follow each guided session ^^<br> :date: __2021-05-26 17:22:28__

> All good<br> :date: __2021-05-26 09:20:17__

> A couple of the timings on the Jo Whiley podcast are out in the second and third weeks. This is as far as I've got so far but I'm enjoying the gradual ramp up.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 10:15:25__

> Mainly a great app, unfortunately it turned off on 4 of the runs, not sure if it's the app or my phone's fault<br> :date: __2021-05-23 20:33:11__

> The app is good overall, however, it doesn't let me set a reminder. I can see the screen, but it doesn't scroll down to set the reminder.<br> :date: __2021-05-22 18:33:29__

> After a few false starts, I have finally completed couch to 5k. The app is great and easy to use, although I'm not running fast enough to get to 5k in 30 mins. I will keep up the running so hopefully, in a couple of weeks, I'll be there as I'm not far off.<br> :date: __2021-05-22 17:48:06__

> Minor issues with automatic music control (often changing the volume too late or for too long) otherwise great way to get into (or back into) running.<br> :date: __2021-05-22 14:24:01__

> Great app. Very motivational. Only improvement I would suggest, I would love to see it have trackers/music attached to it. Ideally you need 3 apps open at the same time, numerous occasions you get so caught up with one, you lose the others.. nothing more frustrating than completing the run and it not saving on the tracker!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 09:55:15__

> Loving the app so far, but am finding it's not logging all of my runs- so having to repeat Run 1 of Week 2 again- hoping it's a one-off but mildly frustrating having to go back again!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 03:48:32__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:26:33__

> Keeps crashing every minute and a half so I can't use it at all.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 13:53:53__

> Works perfectly on an iPhone, pretty terrible on a Samsung galaxy.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 03:34:32__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> Love Jo Whiley coaching, she is so motivational, but the app turns itself off towards the end of most runs! Screen is locked and it is nothing to do with battery saver<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:44:36__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__



#### 2-star reviews

> So far on week 3 going into 4 I feel more confidence on finishing each run. I am hopeful that the next few weeks will be as positive on both my mind and body.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 10:47:42__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Doesn't save my runs and stays on first page so I can't see how I'm progressing through the run I.e what's coming up next ? Mins walk/ run<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:26:43__

> Awful app that is totally unreliable and continously cuts out whilst in use, rendering its existence totally pointless.<br> :date: __2021-05-24 13:10:33__

> Downloaded 3 times but app freezing at the "let's get started" page. To tech support to sort it out!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:49:04__

> Did run 1. Tapped on run 2 the next time, but played run 1. Managed to get it to play run 2, but only recording that I've done the first run!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 00:01:32__

> After downloading the app... the app wouldn't move past the "Ready" screen. Even for me as an utter couch potato expected that I was going have to do some sort of exercise!<br> :date: __2021-05-18 21:05:43__

> WHERE HAS MICHAEL JOHNSON GONE?!!!<br> :date: __2021-05-15 11:25:44__

> Closes down when in use very annoying when your trying to run 11/05/2021 still closes down never closed down on my Samsung phone<br> :date: __2021-05-11 18:59:01__

> Excellent programme to get you running.<br> :date: __2021-05-10 11:54:58__

> Downloaded several times but can't get past the 'let's get started' page. I have now uninstalled it.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 17:51:51__
