In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Sarah Millican is the ultimate coach if you want someone encouraging but not 'fitness trainer shouty over excited' encouraging. Just wish there was a 5k plus option now, will have to keep repeating the last week. Good app though üëç<br> :date: __2021-04-29 12:58:17__

> Great. Really useful and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-29 11:37:36__

> I thought I wouldn't be able to get through the first week and we are now on our fifth,<br> :date: __2021-04-29 10:47:30__

> Couple of glitches but absolutely nothing thats a problem based on the quality of the content.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 09:40:50__

> Thank you, Michael Johnson x<br> :date: __2021-04-29 07:48:58__

> Great motivation to get fitter, really easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-29 07:13:25__

> Well it got me from doing no exercise for the best part of 50 years to running 5K 3 times a week and I'm still going 3 months later. I certainly wouldn't have done it without the app and Sarah Millican as a coach, it wasn't easy and at times i felt like jacking it in but I'm really glad I didn't add in certainly feeling loads of benefits for doing it. So basically it does what it says it will, you just need determination and a bit of stubbiness to get you through.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 22:59:23__

> I've found this app very very good!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 15:02:34__

> It does what it says it will do üëç if you follow the programme and commit to it you will be running close to 5k. Brilliant!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:22:31__

> Amazing. I never ran more than 4 minutes in my entire life. By the end of the program I was running 45 minutes and loved it. I didn't repeat a week despite warnings that week 5 and 6 marked a real turn in the program. For my big surprise, it was as manageable than the previous exercises. I'm sure I haven't acquired the best technique to run efficiently but the app taught me endurance and how to cope mentally with pain and effort. I'm totally satisfied and would highly recommend!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 14:04:53__

> I've started it four times and completed it twice. The incompleted times I got to week seven. At different times I did better with C25K others I needed it. Not having been a runner for long I found that if I didn't run for over a few months I needed the program. It's fantastic to help you get started or restart. Shame Michael Johnson is no longer a trainer as he has been with me on my journey. My only quibble is that I was expecting a bit more from the trainers. Can be a bit repetitive.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 04:01:00__

> Love the app, so far I'm finding the coaches voices very boring and uninspiring, I want a "üëçüòÄ well done you've just run 5mins whoop whoop! " what I'm getting is "üòê well done" I've since used Sarah Milachan and she's great, I graduated today .<br> :date: __2021-04-23 18:52:03__

> Couldn't run for longer than 60 seconds without passing out when I started, now i can run non-stop for 30 minutes (and nearly 5k)! First few weeks were hardest but after that you can feel the progress in your every day life which gives that added bit of motivation. Only issue I had with the app was that if someone called me the app would stop and be unable to continue. Which was frustrating at times.<br> :date: __2021-04-22 14:04:31__

> Positive<br> :date: __2021-04-22 10:38:48__

> Great app and idea. Although sometimes the screen disappears so you start it again only to find out it's still running so you have 2 of them running<br> :date: __2021-04-20 21:06:21__

> Great app for motivation, and you can listen to your music at the same time. Only glitch is it cuts out if I receive a what's app message! Quite frustrating when you're in the middle of a run and don't know how long you've got left!<br> :date: __2021-04-20 08:06:17__

> Does what it says, helps you run 5k in 9 weeks. Similar runs in the same week have the same recordings which I personally found to be more off putting than helpful. Otherwise, can't fault.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 12:41:40__

> Reduced to 4 stars as I do not understand why updates to a previously perfect app resulted in extra clicks for the user. These additional frames are simply annoying and add little to no value.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 08:30:49__

> Gutted about Michael Johnson going to be honest. Other than that, great coaches. I would like the skip button not to be so harsh though. I press skip and it will skip like 5 minutes.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:42:09__

> The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because Michael Johnson is coming off the app as one of the trainers.üòî Other than that it's been very helpful in getting me back into running.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 20:35:10__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> Love Jo Whiley coaching, she is so motivational, but the app turns itself off towards the end of most runs! Screen is locked and it is nothing to do with battery saver<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:44:36__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__

> So downloaded this app and used it with music on my old phone. Used Jo as my coach as she sounds sincere. New phone now cant listen to Jo & music- it says "can't use music with this trainer". Use Laura, got my music but no marker for half way through to turn around- guessing. Why is it so random and variable???<br> :date: __2021-04-17 20:14:29__

> Great Idea! Very basic, app need work. Issues include: Volume of narrator is very low compared to other apps at the same phone volume level so I can't play music while trying to listen to instructions. Silent running for me. Not intuitive and I consistant, on the last day week two second to last run is the only time Sanjeev does not tell me to start running. Pointless celebrity Voices, they all say the exact same thing... What's the point? I genuinely thought they had recorded it for someone.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 08:23:54__

> Great app, but since the update I have lost my coach, so not much point to it after that. Before I lost my coach, it was a great app, gave you motivation and teaches you well.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:13:40__

> Like the app, super easy and helps push you to the goal. However, it is highly irritating that certain people haven't recorded every run so you find yourself swapping around.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 23:14:11__

> This app has given up on me at week 7 Run 3!!!!!! Help!!!!! What can I do to solve this issue?<br> :date: __2021-04-11 19:54:32__

> It is Good but suffers many bugs. Overall, I am finding it a great app. But the bugs are annoying. Almost every time I start a run the audio doesn't work and I have to back out and restart. Or often the audio will not pause if you tell it to, even continuing to play after you close the run (only stopping when the app is completely closed) If they could fix the audio bugs out, this would be a perfect app for couch to 5k.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 12:37:21__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Unfortunately even after changing settings on my phone, the app would just stop whilst on my run. Sometimes twice. I now have to listen to the poscasts.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 21:11:12__

> Was good the first few uses, but the last 3 runs the app has stopped multiple times so I have to restart the run or just guess when to stop jogging, it's very frustrating. I've double checked my settings and they're how they should be. Think I will end up uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 13:25:48__

> For some reason, on a Pixel phone, the audio will only work when live caption is turned on...which then uses additional battery. Thought it might be an issue with the app, but tried it on an iPhone and a Motorola running Android 8, no problems there at all. Kinda embarrassing that Google's phones are having such an issue on their own app platform.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 19:54:24__

> No more Michael Jordan? He shouldn't have been removed without a sportsperson of note prepared as a replacement. Personally I am not motivated by a Doctor, DJ, Comedian or a member of the general public.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 05:36:45__

> Since update it doesn't work. Used to be brilliant.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 10:21:10__

> Can't open it üòï<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:46:59__

> Downloaded so many times and followed all instructions to get it work and it fails every single time! In addition the settings don't account for new hauwei phones!<br> :date: __2021-04-16 20:13:18__

> Twice I've down loaded get to end press continue and it freezes<br> :date: __2021-04-13 16:42:45__

> Utterly unhelpful for building confidence. Drops a massive difficulty spike in week five and offers no help for anyone struggling to keep up. Will ultimately leave anyone who can't match the pace unmotivated. A dismal and disheartening app.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 00:58:42__

> No audio description in the run which makes it pretty unusable and pointless. My music volume dips but there is no voiceover. Constantly checking the phone doesn't exactly work when trying to run. The timer is also very glitchy and keeps pausing and jumping. Bit of a shambles and so disappointing as so many people say it's a brilliant app (when it works)<br> :date: __2021-04-09 11:36:40__

> Couldn't open it on my phone ?<br> :date: __2021-04-06 18:19:47__
