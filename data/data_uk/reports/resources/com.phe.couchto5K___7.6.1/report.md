## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Really helps getting started. The audio tracks are a great form of extra external motivation and I found it helped not to have to focus on time myself. Being told how long has gone helps break it up and I just run until the voice says stop.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 17:33:12__

> This is brilliant and it totally works!! Feeling amazing üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüéâ<br> :date: __2021-05-01 17:25:54__

> Fab fab fab<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:48:54__

> Brilliant, just completed my first 5k and I struggled to run for a minute when I started. Clear and encouraging instructions.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:30:16__

> Only completed first 3 weeks so far but really pleased with the way it's helping me build up my stamina again at a sensible rate as I've just started running again at 60.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:10:08__

> Works a treat<br> :date: __2021-05-01 13:16:20__

> Fantastic! Jo Whiley was a star all the way through the nine weeks. By<br> :date: __2021-05-01 11:12:24__

> I loved it! A great starting point for a complete beginner x<br> :date: __2021-05-01 09:47:17__

> Easy to use and gets you into running at a manageble and achieveiable pace, highly recommended<br> :date: __2021-05-01 09:17:24__

> Could do with a counter to measure the 5k as there are some people who are slow at running and don't manage the 5k in 30 mins<br> :date: __2021-05-01 12:54:24__

> This is great idea that you can still tailor to yout own needs and ability. i work shifts so if i'm not ready to move on or have a long break and have to repeat, its easily done. But it is still supportive and motivating because your expectations are your own and the coach's voice is there when you need it.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 17:31:57__

> Its a good app but has lost signal or just stopped working a couple of times.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 13:15:08__

> Great way to get moving<br> :date: __2021-04-30 08:44:59__

> Excellent plan, I never believed that I could be able to run for 30 minutes but I graduated today. I did have a couple of issues with the app stopping half way through but it that may have been due to other apps running in the background.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 07:11:55__

> Fantastic app for getting started, just be aware of a few things. You need to leave it running and reopen from the open apps screen rather than clicking it again (even if you don't properly close it) as it will just run twice e.g. Two sets of timers and voices. Also do consistently check the timing as if you're in a place with poor connection the app stalls. I walked for 15 minutes as part of a 5 minute warm up. Tricky if on a tight schedule.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 17:33:57__

> I've started it four times and completed it twice. The incompleted times I got to week seven. At different times I did better with C25K others I needed it. Not having been a runner for long I found that if I didn't run for over a few months I needed the program. It's fantastic to help you get started or restart. Shame Michael Johnson is no longer a trainer as he has been with me on my journey. My only quibble is that I was expecting a bit more from the trainers. Can be a bit repetitive.<br> :date: __2021-04-28 04:01:00__

> Love the app, so far I'm finding the coaches voices very boring and uninspiring, I want a "üëçüòÄ well done you've just run 5mins whoop whoop! " what I'm getting is "üòê well done" I've since used Sarah Milachan and she's great, I graduated today .<br> :date: __2021-04-23 18:52:03__

> Couldn't run for longer than 60 seconds without passing out when I started, now i can run non-stop for 30 minutes (and nearly 5k)! First few weeks were hardest but after that you can feel the progress in your every day life which gives that added bit of motivation. Only issue I had with the app was that if someone called me the app would stop and be unable to continue. Which was frustrating at times.<br> :date: __2021-04-22 14:04:31__

> Positive<br> :date: __2021-04-22 10:38:48__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> Love Jo Whiley coaching, she is so motivational, but the app turns itself off towards the end of most runs! Screen is locked and it is nothing to do with battery saver<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:44:36__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__

> So downloaded this app and used it with music on my old phone. Used Jo as my coach as she sounds sincere. New phone now cant listen to Jo & music- it says "can't use music with this trainer". Use Laura, got my music but no marker for half way through to turn around- guessing. Why is it so random and variable???<br> :date: __2021-04-17 20:14:29__

> Great Idea! Very basic, app need work. Issues include: Volume of narrator is very low compared to other apps at the same phone volume level so I can't play music while trying to listen to instructions. Silent running for me. Not intuitive and I consistant, on the last day week two second to last run is the only time Sanjeev does not tell me to start running. Pointless celebrity Voices, they all say the exact same thing... What's the point? I genuinely thought they had recorded it for someone.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 08:23:54__

> Great app, but since the update I have lost my coach, so not much point to it after that. Before I lost my coach, it was a great app, gave you motivation and teaches you well.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:13:40__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Unfortunately even after changing settings on my phone, the app would just stop whilst on my run. Sometimes twice. I now have to listen to the poscasts.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 21:11:12__

> Was good the first few uses, but the last 3 runs the app has stopped multiple times so I have to restart the run or just guess when to stop jogging, it's very frustrating. I've double checked my settings and they're how they should be. Think I will end up uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 13:25:48__

> For some reason, on a Pixel phone, the audio will only work when live caption is turned on...which then uses additional battery. Thought it might be an issue with the app, but tried it on an iPhone and a Motorola running Android 8, no problems there at all. Kinda embarrassing that Google's phones are having such an issue on their own app platform.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 19:54:24__

> The app keeps stopping in the middle of my runs and repeats talking on each part, is there a bug? I have reinstalled a few times.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 20:13:38__

> No more Michael Jordan? He shouldn't have been removed without a sportsperson of note prepared as a replacement. Personally I am not motivated by a Doctor, DJ, Comedian or a member of the general public.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 05:36:45__

> Since update it doesn't work. Used to be brilliant.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 10:21:10__

> Rubbish now its updated. Old version was perfect<br> :date: __2021-04-21 19:14:03__

> Can't open it üòï<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:46:59__

> Downloaded so many times and followed all instructions to get it work and it fails every single time! In addition the settings don't account for new hauwei phones!<br> :date: __2021-04-16 20:13:18__

> Twice I've down loaded get to end press continue and it freezes<br> :date: __2021-04-13 16:42:45__

> Utterly unhelpful for building confidence. Drops a massive difficulty spike in week five and offers no help for anyone struggling to keep up. Will ultimately leave anyone who can't match the pace unmotivated. A dismal and disheartening app.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 00:58:42__

> No audio description in the run which makes it pretty unusable and pointless. My music volume dips but there is no voiceover. Constantly checking the phone doesn't exactly work when trying to run. The timer is also very glitchy and keeps pausing and jumping. Bit of a shambles and so disappointing as so many people say it's a brilliant app (when it works)<br> :date: __2021-04-09 11:36:40__

> Couldn't open it on my phone ?<br> :date: __2021-04-06 18:19:47__
