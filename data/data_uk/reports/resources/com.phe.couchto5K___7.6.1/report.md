## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> When I first started this app I thought I wouldn't be able to run 30 minutes let alone a minute but during the weeks I could feel my body getting stronger I now run 30 minutes every other day l<br> :date: __2021-04-18 09:26:22__

> Great App for easing you into running gently.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 09:10:52__

> Went from couch to 5k to a marathon in 8 months, great experience :)<br> :date: __2021-04-17 19:50:48__

> Great so and easy to use<br> :date: __2021-04-17 18:39:01__

> On week 4 and it is a great help!!<br> :date: __2021-04-17 18:04:12__

> Great app, mainly because it was a success, I used to be in great shape and had totally lost it, tried to run and realised I couldn't anymore, so humbling as it was I followed this program religiously and ran my last 30min/5k+ run yesterday, I'm gonna continue running 5ks 3/4 times a week and then I'll be looking to push for 10k<br> :date: __2021-04-17 16:28:29__

> To anyone looking for that gentle and convincing encouragement in your ear, this is an excellent app. I loved and appreciated being able to load up high energy pace setting music at the same time, as having Jo Whileys' (my choice for instructor) positivity exuding confidence. The incremental steps to get you running non stop for 30 minutes is astonishing, considering I never imagined I could run at the start, I am now looking ahead and now training for a 10k race!<br> :date: __2021-04-17 15:18:51__

> Just finished my final run today! I have always hated running but this app has changed the way i approach runs. I'm going to be continuing. For anyone just starting I would say wk 4 is a step up from the first 3 weeks but you can do it. And you won't stop from there! I have a Huawei phone and have found it to cut out /stop working on a number of runs - luckily i was running with my sister who has an iphone.<br> :date: __2021-04-17 11:29:25__

> Excellent guidance<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:08:44__

> Easy to use. Works over listening to your own music app. Clear instructions. Edit - Just completed week 9. Sense of achievement fantastic as achievable with this app<br> :date: __2021-04-17 09:06:17__

> The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because Michael Johnson is coming off the app as one of the trainers.😔 Other than that it's been very helpful in getting me back into running.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 20:35:10__

> Great way to get into running again and though the longer periods of running seem daunting you do find yourself doing it. The one thing I would like to see fixed is the voice overs. It's very obvious that they recorded a run one session for each week and that's it. So you are completing run 3 and it's still telling you that you need to do 2 more runs that week, or you start week 2 and on run 3 it's still reminding you to complete the 3 runs in week 1.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 09:14:15__

> Great app although it didn't seem to be quite up-to-date on a couple of occasions. Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 20:41:12__

> User friendly and very supportive and encouraging.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 09:48:47__

> Good app. Simple to use. My only gripe is it not saving my run automatically after the voice prompts tell me that I'm done. I had to come back to it this morning and redo the two runs I've done to make sure I saved it.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:14:29__

> Easy to use, makes getting up & out easier<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:50:12__

> Simple, easy to follow would recommend for someone who has not exercised in forever!<br> :date: __2021-04-13 10:26:26__

> Just started, good app as builds you up slowly but disapointing that there is no distance shown, calories burn average speed in running intervals. This would make it more rewarding. I would like to measure improvement by runing more miles/km or increase speed in the same given time. Without it progres can only be measured by "I have done it" and obviouly improved but knowing eg 1st day in 8mins my distance was 2km, 2nd run was 2.1km, and 3rd was 2.2km and so on...but anyway I will try my best<br> :date: __2021-04-12 20:41:10__

> Does what it says<br> :date: __2021-04-12 17:39:50__

> Great app to motivate the most novice of runners like me!! Once I worked out the settings to stop the app turning off in the background it really is fab!<br> :date: __2021-04-12 10:38:32__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__

> So downloaded this app and used it with music on my old phone. Used Jo as my coach as she sounds sincere. New phone now cant listen to Jo & music- it says "can't use music with this trainer". Use Laura, got my music but no marker for half way through to turn around- guessing. Why is it so random and variable???<br> :date: __2021-04-17 20:14:29__

> Great Idea! Very basic, app need work. Issues include: Volume of narrator is very low compared to other apps at the same phone volume level so I can't play music while trying to listen to instructions. Silent running for me. Not intuitive and I consistant, on the last day week two second to last run is the only time Sanjeev does not tell me to start running. Pointless celebrity Voices, they all say the exact same thing... What's the point? I genuinely thought they had recorded it for someone.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 08:23:54__

> Great app, but since the update I have lost my coach, so not much point to it after that. Before I lost my coach, it was a great app, gave you motivation and teaches you well.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:13:40__

> Like the app, super easy and helps push you to the goal. However, it is highly irritating that certain people haven't recorded every run so you find yourself swapping around.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 23:14:11__

> This app has given up on me at week 7 Run 3!!!!!! Help!!!!! What can I do to solve this issue?<br> :date: __2021-04-11 19:54:32__

> It is Good but suffers many bugs. Overall, I am finding it a great app. But the bugs are annoying. Almost every time I start a run the audio doesn't work and I have to back out and restart. Or often the audio will not pause if you tell it to, even continuing to play after you close the run (only stopping when the app is completely closed) If they could fix the audio bugs out, this would be a perfect app for couch to 5k.<br> :date: __2021-04-11 12:37:21__

> Quite motivational but let down by the glitches. It sometimes stops unexpectedly. Overall getting me there 🙂<br> :date: __2021-04-10 10:11:02__

> Amazing app, but recent relaunch needs urgent fixes. When you start a run of you navigate away from the app (to change music or whatever) it takes you out of the run and you have to start it again. Big flaw, please fix asap please. Also sad Michael Johnson will leave as a coach. Legend.<br> :date: __2021-04-09 20:26:11__

> No map of run on android phone<br> :date: __2021-04-09 15:13:17__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Why??<br> :date: __2021-04-17 12:35:30__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Unfortunately even after changing settings on my phone, the app would just stop whilst on my run. Sometimes twice. I now have to listen to the poscasts.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 21:11:12__

> Was good the first few uses, but the last 3 runs the app has stopped multiple times so I have to restart the run or just guess when to stop jogging, it's very frustrating. I've double checked my settings and they're how they should be. Think I will end up uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 13:25:48__

> For some reason, on a Pixel phone, the audio will only work when live caption is turned on...which then uses additional battery. Thought it might be an issue with the app, but tried it on an iPhone and a Motorola running Android 8, no problems there at all. Kinda embarrassing that Google's phones are having such an issue on their own app platform.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 19:54:24__

> Audio and availability of speakers very temperamental<br> :date: __2021-03-27 21:37:51__

> The concept is good, but you can tell it's a GCSE/A level student's project<br> :date: __2021-03-25 18:56:53__

> Can't open it 😕<br> :date: __2021-04-17 10:46:59__

> Downloaded so many times and followed all instructions to get it work and it fails every single time! In addition the settings don't account for new hauwei phones!<br> :date: __2021-04-16 20:13:18__

> Twice I've down loaded get to end press continue and it freezes<br> :date: __2021-04-13 16:42:45__

> Utterly unhelpful for building confidence. Drops a massive difficulty spike in week five and offers no help for anyone struggling to keep up. Will ultimately leave anyone who can't match the pace unmotivated. A dismal and disheartening app.<br> :date: __2021-04-12 00:58:42__

> No audio description in the run which makes it pretty unusable and pointless. My music volume dips but there is no voiceover. Constantly checking the phone doesn't exactly work when trying to run. The timer is also very glitchy and keeps pausing and jumping. Bit of a shambles and so disappointing as so many people say it's a brilliant app (when it works)<br> :date: __2021-04-09 11:36:40__

> Keeps freezing while out running and miss times when supposed to stop and walk. Tried several times uninstalling and reinstalling and tried all the different voice coaches but same problem.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 16:26:44__

> Too glitchy<br> :date: __2021-03-29 21:30:35__
