## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I doubted I could run 5k but this plan is brilliant, it does push you just enough but I can confirm it works having just completed my final run this morning. At the pace I run I was around 1.5k off making the 5k but found today my fitness had been upped enough to run on and actually complete the final run at 5k. Brilliant app and turned a non runner into someone who now quite enjoys it.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 14:07:44__

> Nice step approach to running. Easy increase each week<br> :date: __2021-05-09 12:45:12__

> Started using it and did the first 2 runs fine. I bought a new Samsung A52 and put the app on that . Had to go through setting it up again and got to " let's get started" and it wouldn't go any further? Don't know 8f it's my phone or the app. Will have to go back to my old phone for the run.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:49:29__

> Great app to get to 5k<br> :date: __2021-05-09 10:46:55__

> This app is a life saver recommending it to everyone that what to start doing something for them self brilliant app plus they have another app where it guide you about food and gives you ideals<br> :date: __2021-05-09 10:19:13__

> Great App managed to graduate and used Sarah as my coach! Never thought I could do it but its really simple to follow easy to use and no issues with the app for me. Wish there was a 5 to 10k to keep building.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 09:46:34__

> Amazing programme and it's free!<br> :date: __2021-05-09 09:04:59__

> Really clear and easy to use app, thanks :-)<br> :date: __2021-05-08 22:12:21__

> I didn't think anything could get me running. Now I'm on week 4 and enjoying it. Jo Whiley as trainer is so encouraging!<br> :date: __2021-05-08 17:57:12__

> Good experience great app<br> :date: __2021-05-08 17:06:14__

> Pretty good 👍<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:30:37__

> Why has it stopped showing runs being finished on 2nd week? Had no issues till w2r2.<br> :date: __2021-05-08 22:49:56__

> Great app to get you motivated and start jogging personally i found i need to repeat weeks and am still working through at my own time and pace. Its helped me get started and I am grateful for that i dont care how many weeks or months it takes me.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 10:58:18__

> Great to have the audio to talk you through. Seems to turn itself off sometimes and I lose my place, but over all very good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 08:51:00__

> Very positive, great help in getting me back to fitness after my heart attack. Would be good if it stepped up more gradually in the 2nd half of the programme though.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 17:29:18__

> Very easy to use. Simple and just guides you through your run. Fantastic. If you want to record your activities, use something like Fitbit as well. Even better if age category related programs existed.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 14:06:38__

> Very good.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 13:50:11__

> A very good app for putting the tiger in you .<br> :date: __2021-05-06 05:57:05__

> Convenient and very encouraging. Found some of the jumps from one run to the next rather difficult.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 18:22:10__

> Good reason to motivate yourself. Sometimes dies in the middle of a session and starts again. But can be ffwd to where you were. You can also redo previous weeks if it's going too fast which isn't really clear in the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 10:33:12__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> Love Jo Whiley coaching, she is so motivational, but the app turns itself off towards the end of most runs! Screen is locked and it is nothing to do with battery saver<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:44:36__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__

> So downloaded this app and used it with music on my old phone. Used Jo as my coach as she sounds sincere. New phone now cant listen to Jo & music- it says "can't use music with this trainer". Use Laura, got my music but no marker for half way through to turn around- guessing. Why is it so random and variable???<br> :date: __2021-04-17 20:14:29__

> Great Idea! Very basic, app need work. Issues include: Volume of narrator is very low compared to other apps at the same phone volume level so I can't play music while trying to listen to instructions. Silent running for me. Not intuitive and I consistant, on the last day week two second to last run is the only time Sanjeev does not tell me to start running. Pointless celebrity Voices, they all say the exact same thing... What's the point? I genuinely thought they had recorded it for someone.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 08:23:54__

> Great app, but since the update I have lost my coach, so not much point to it after that. Before I lost my coach, it was a great app, gave you motivation and teaches you well.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:13:40__



#### 2-star reviews

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Unfortunately even after changing settings on my phone, the app would just stop whilst on my run. Sometimes twice. I now have to listen to the poscasts.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 21:11:12__

> Was good the first few uses, but the last 3 runs the app has stopped multiple times so I have to restart the run or just guess when to stop jogging, it's very frustrating. I've double checked my settings and they're how they should be. Think I will end up uninstalling.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 13:25:48__

> For some reason, on a Pixel phone, the audio will only work when live caption is turned on...which then uses additional battery. Thought it might be an issue with the app, but tried it on an iPhone and a Motorola running Android 8, no problems there at all. Kinda embarrassing that Google's phones are having such an issue on their own app platform.<br> :date: __2021-03-28 19:54:24__

> The app keeps stopping in the middle of my runs and repeats talking on each part, is there a bug? I have reinstalled a few times.<br> :date: __2021-04-29 20:13:38__

> No more Michael Jordan? He shouldn't have been removed without a sportsperson of note prepared as a replacement. Personally I am not motivated by a Doctor, DJ, Comedian or a member of the general public.<br> :date: __2021-04-25 05:36:45__
