### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Straight forward to enter data, takes less than a minute and is massively worthwhile. It reports to users and the Govt, so we can see what's going on, locally and nationally. Everyone should do it!vf<br> :date: __2021-02-06 15:22:02__

> Only problem I don't know my blood group so I had to guess. There should be an option under blood group to say don't know<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:32:39__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me I haven't reported for 2 or more days. I've tried contacting you various ways, but nothing has changed except it can read up to 5 days now. Am I wasting my time?<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:07:29__

> I failed first of all to enter my vaccination details because I was using as an early version of the app. It was only when I deleted the app in frustration that I realized that if I reinstalled it I might get a newer version. I did email Zoe for help but the instructions were confusing<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:39:41__

> Lack of possibility to describe reactions to vaccination that might be helpful for the study.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 16:27:43__

> Was an avid user but then needed to change my email address and there's no function to do that nor way to contact the author. So had to delete.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 22:15:07__

> Report in daily but sometimes it's not recorded and I am being told that it's a day or more since I reported in. A month later and this is still happening, every few days my input is not being recorded<br> :date: __2021-02-01 18:17:15__

> Not able to input vaccine side effects other than on arm - glitch? Think it would benefit you to capture which vaccine manufacturer has been given too.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 19:47:12__

> The app continues to be glitchy as it won't let me pick the final option to submit my report Happens a few times. Means I forgot to retry later and then miss a day or two<br> :date: __2021-01-25 08:23:17__

> Since I am not sick, I answer 3 questions every day and I am done. This is not very interesting, but I want to contribute and hope I am doing so. I trust that it is a well designed study, given its sponsors. I suppose my only frustration is that more people are not participating; especially not in my county, where there are at present too few to enable a county wide report. I do keep sharing the app!<br> :date: __2021-01-25 05:14:54__

> Great except notifications have stopped working so forget to report daily.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:10:03__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing. Have you even seen this? Why don't you respond to my numerous contacts about this? I entered yesterday. The app says 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:17:00__

> The map makes less sense since they started using cases per million when everywhere else does it per100,000. It also appears data for Wales is at least a fortnight behind.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 01:08:37__

> The app has begun erroring since yesterday (28th Jan 2021). It loads, the screen with 'report today, even if you're well' appears for a split second before the whole screen goes white and stays that way. It's now unusable and this is day two of not being able to log.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 11:47:20__

> Unfortunately when I tried to insert a password my phone's keyboard covered the box I was meant to write it in! An elementary design error which rendered the app useless. I'm surprised this hasn't been fixed.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 17:23:40__

> I installed it 3 weeks ago, and to begin with it worked fine. Then it asked me to log in with my password and email for the first time. I was unable to do that because on my phone - a Samsung Galaxy A10 - as soon as I begin to type, the keyboard covers the place where the password has to go! It was also telling me my password wasn't recognised although I am certain it was the one I submitted. I tried the Force Stop recommended but it made no difference. finally I uninstalled the app. I have tried now to reinstall it but I guess I will still have the same problem. I'd be really grateful if anyone can help. It 's a great idea, but the app needs to be reliable. I am disappointed not to be able to participate.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 22:54:01__

> Been using this all way through the pandemic and think it's been very useful for understanding the various symptoms covid-19 can display. However the app has now stoped working entirely on my phone. On the old it works fine and the settings seems to be the same.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:48:33__

> My first vaccine date disappeared .<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:53:26__

> A giant missed opportunity. With the urgent need for better evidence on effective preventative or treatment options, why not collect data on a wide variety of products and practices while infection rates are so high? Any substance or routine correlated with lower infection or disease severity rates can then be prioritised for investigation. For example, N acetyl cysteine, quercetin, turmeric/curcumin, Nasal spray compounds or lavage, oestrogen, progesterone, daily hours slept, etc.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 15:26:26__

> I am unable to report a problem with the app anywhere else, so I'm doing it here: recent update has added a mandotory blood group question before any other reporting options. I don't know my blood group, so cannot report! There is no option to skip or to choose "I don't know"<br> :date: __2021-01-16 16:54:02__

> The app had been working fine for over a week but currently freezes with a white screen. Not sure how this has happened, please fix the bug?<br> :date: __2021-01-16 10:56:55__

> Downloaded this. Suspected/documented Covid only had 'yes" answers. Left that as the answer was no and completed the other questions as 'no' except that I could count on someone IF I needed help. With those entirely correct answers, 'continue' button is not highlighted. Only highlights if you say yes to documented or suspected Covid. I thought this was a general app for all, not reliant on Covid contact. Am I doing something wrong?<br> :date: __2021-02-06 14:01:42__

> Not easy to use. Finding how to report is poorly designed. No wonder you are short of 70+s.. its now improved now having problems editing vaccine type and batch<br> :date: __2021-02-06 13:02:10__

> Completely useless, no longer reminds me every day 🙄 Lucky if I remember to use it once a month now 😆 and that's NOT an exaggeration!<br> :date: __2021-02-06 05:36:22__

> Have uninstalled the app. Watched the recent webinar and wasn't impressed. BoJo and his Tory cronies will risk everyone's lives no matter what scientific advice is provided.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 00:10:13__

> Never gave any info except for NI resident, so no good for me in Brighton<br> :date: __2021-02-02 19:59:56__

> This should be such a simple little app. Why is it taking up 479 MB of my phone's storage??<br> :date: __2021-02-01 14:58:00__

> Not very good at all all estimated numbers look bigger than what there actually is as bad as bbc putting so much fear we know covid is there ive had it but we need more info on recovered not just admissions and deaths i am sorry for all lives lost but we need to see the other side also<br> :date: __2021-01-30 14:19:45__

> The app has worked perfectly until today and now it starts to load and then flips to a blank screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it and logged back in but still the same problem. I'm using it on an android smartphone and have today also loaded and logged into it on an ipad but still the same error 🙁<br> :date: __2021-01-29 12:03:13__

> Graph for the Midlands hasn't been updated since 9/1 and I can't find a way to report this problem other than in the play store. Please fix<br> :date: __2021-01-25 18:02:21__

> Stopped working 24 January?? Anyone else having this issue. Been using it since March<br> :date: __2021-01-25 10:55:09__
