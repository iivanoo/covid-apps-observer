## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Yay ! Now can change the alert sound, both I, my neighbour and my neighbour's dog are happy :-)<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:15:22__

> Great App, functions well. Alot of people moaning about the noise but they need to understand it was originally set up to alert responders like myself to a cardiac arrest and that this happens infrequently and needs to be loud and out there to make sure it alerts us! I have responded using it and it was very good and I know of several responders that use it well.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:23:43__

> Helping in times like these is vital. User friendly precise and professional.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 17:43:57__

> Always freeze accept button when I am assigned for task...don't know what's happening...<br> :date: __2020-09-14 15:21:40__

> A service that provides help for people in need. Very professional and friendly service that's was needed during the Covid 19 pandemic but still provides essential services through out the year.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 21:29:15__

> Works well! Love being a Responder<br> :date: __2020-08-26 13:45:55__

> Never had a problem with this app. Very straight forward and they are keen to improve it as it gets used more and more.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:17:18__

> Never had an issue with the app. I use the OHCA responder as not signed up for the NHS voluntary scheme. One glitch I do need help with. I cannot upload photo or position if a community defib. Have tried on 2 phones. Both have location and tags unlocked. But no joy. Any ideas. For those below who are not happy with the app. Keep trying. Be patient. This app has saved lives around the world. It was a steep climb for the design team to go from out of hospital cardiac arrest to what it is now<br> :date: __2020-06-12 12:32:12__

> Easy to use and extremely useful.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 21:45:43__

> Early experience so far is fine. Though when I select 'find a route' in simulation mode Uber opens rather than Google maps. Any ideas on how to correct this?<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:02:09__

> Excellent and very easy to use. However there is more way to return to the information page after you have accepted the task.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:59:08__

> Swift reply<br> :date: __2020-12-30 22:08:38__

> As others have reported since last week I have not been receiving the sound alerts and the app is now version 12.5 - I can choose the sound on the"me" page but even the simulated alert doesn't produce a sound. I have missed several alerts including a patient transport. I now have tested the push notification and this worked, so will wait to see what happens when I get a real alert. Thanks for the quick response.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 12:30:16__

> Good support, very worthwhile and satisfying role in the community.<br> :date: __2020-12-27 00:45:31__

> Since recent update, siren won't play when simulating a test. Volume is up full, setting is active to play siren even on silent, all app permissions are same prior to update. Don't know if it will work if turnout is real?<br> :date: __2020-12-24 11:11:53__

> App won't let me register. Freezes with a spinning wheel icon after filling in the form<br> :date: __2020-12-19 03:03:10__

> Appreciate your helpful response - sadly my area is not on the list but I noticed the link for registering my interest in case it is added in the future. Thank you and all the best<br> :date: __2020-10-08 19:52:04__

> Please give us a volume control for that dreadful siren<br> :date: __2020-09-26 15:13:11__

> Well after not bothering to log on much over the summer due to never being called on, I received an email saying more people were needing help. Plus I felt I should do something to say thank you for early access to the Track and Trace app. I logged on half an hour ago and just had my first call! She's already received help from a neighbour but was very grateful for the call.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 11:51:16__

> Since December when I was allowed to change alert tone. Or had a choice to change if I so wished. I do not get visit alert icon on screen ???? I have checked my phone settings and haven't disabled anything. I still get alert icons for all other messages and emails ??????<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:14:33__

> Been a Responder since first lockdown. Since the option to turn off the 'far too loud' original siren was added I've barely received any notifications (sound or pop up). But 10 Messages state that I failed to respond to an alerts since New Year's Eve! I did respond to two other alerts where the clients did not require assistance, but these actions aren't recorded even though I tagged them as "no assistance required". It doesn't appear to me that the App is working correctly.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 11:27:24__

> I have just installed the app, having been accepted as a Royal Volunteer Service volunteer. When I tried to simulate an alert just now, it could not locate me on the world map, even though I had turned on 'show me on the map'. There seems to be no other way of telling the app where I am. Please advise what I should do. Thanks,<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:49:31__

> UPDATE! Since couple of bug fixes - slightly improved, but my 'On Duty Hours' only increase when marked "off duty" on the toggles. Still unable to load AED's.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 12:02:28__

> I am missing calls because there is no sound alert !!!<br> :date: __2020-12-26 17:32:36__

> Since the new update the Responder app defined alert sound does not work. Instead it uses the standard system alert sound. I sent a test notification from the website as suggested but the loud alert sound does not work.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:35:56__

> I also can't get the sirens to work. All settings are as before.<br> :date: __2020-12-22 20:41:26__

> Not enough room to write in here what needs addressing as it's limited to 500 letters and spaces I'd barely touched the surface on what needs sorting and ran out of space, but there isn't enough information or user functionality in the app we need a lot more communication options in app with a more detailed description to assist with dealing with failed calls not being answered by the people that are in need plus a lot of other options and also an in app guidance and helpcentre<br> :date: __2020-12-10 11:08:18__

> Like others have said, I have an issue with the siren. I am a petsitter and it terrifies some of the cats I am visiting. I did ring and complain about this. I ended up turning it off the weeks. I have just turned it back on. Two alerts I accepted. First I keep ringing so dropped the job. Another had already arranged for someone to take him shopping. Now I have just got back the alert I dropped earlier and still no answer. The alerts are not reliable.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:46:36__

> Good app but siren way too loud, it's driving my neighbour mad ! Apart from that, as others say here, 90% of people I ring have no idea why I rang, or how or why somebody put them on list. That needs addressing . On top of that some of the alerts are days old ,their prescription or shopping done days ago.Im becoming a bit disheartened wasting my time every day. I'm more than happy to run around for folks but less happy with wasted calls<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:11:24__

> Update: Thanks for your quick response. Although your suggestions didn't resolve the problem, they did nudge me to check elsewhere on the app. When it became possible to choose a notification other than Siren before xmas, I chose Default and that's where the problem is. I just did Push Notifications having selected Siren, then Pager, I got full notifications from both. I hope this helps you and others who have had simular problems. This is a question rather than a review. Why since the app was upgraded on the 2nd Jan 21 does my phone no longer get notifications? I do get the requests, but won't know unless I open the app and check messages/coms. The app notification screen has notifcations as On. Allow Dot Notifications is On. Under Categories The message is This app has not posted any notifications. A Push Notification Test did get received in Messages, but sadly no alerts. My phone is a Moto G5S using Oreio 8.0. There will be no more upgrades from Motorola.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 19:49:53__

> I used to get push notifications but don't anymore, I click on the app and there is a task waiting for me! I have checked all of my settings and they are fine, its just suddenly stopped working and I only see tasks when I open the app. I have tried sending a test notification but it didn't work and I have gone through all settings but can't see why it doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 20:00:58__

> I think this app is poorly designed and poorly tested. I ended up turning it off. Shame because it's a good idea. There's overly loud alerts, and when you do get a notification there's no detail to decide whether to accept a task. Sometimes you get messages from the managers which can't be accessed.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 00:59:20__

> Location update not working in the background (Android 11, Samsung S20), always getting alerts for emergencies 25mi away. It seems Android 11 isn't allowing an app anymore to ask for permanent background location permissions at point of installation. You have to go in the android apps settings and activate it manually.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 10:50:40__

> STILL UNABLE, to upload photos of new AEDs locations to the GoodSAM app this is after installing the latest version available. When trying to use a photo taken with a google pixel phone with all location accesses switch on, the GoodSAM app still says to use a picture with location services switched on. In the past, I've replied via email to yourselves about this issue, uploaded bug reports sent pictures and still awaiting your reply. The GoodSAM app still won't sync up with android auto.<br> :date: __2021-01-01 15:38:33__

> I haven't had contact for over s week and when i go into app says wrong email address !also no siren before that and missed several requests. Not contacted very often. Sometimes people dont need any help.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 19:12:30__

> When I access the map it get stuck and no response on the screen so can't escape. I have to uninstall and reinstall. This is on the samsung A40<br> :date: __2020-12-29 14:54:52__

> I have the same problem as previous reviewer ie no sound on Goodsam notifications. I've gone to the website and sent myself a push notification. I now get the standard Samsung notification sound rather than the very distinctive Goodsam loud SIREN. How do I get back to the siren?<br> :date: __2020-12-23 13:08:55__

> Since last weeks update I no longer receive an audio alert, just visual alert. I have had 6 alerts and missed a couple because of no siren. I have reinstalled the app, re booted the phone and tried it on another Sony and a Samsung. The same problem occurs. Really need a fix to ensure I don't miss any more alerts.<br> :date: __2020-12-23 11:56:05__

> App is ok but no way to check back on previous messages. I responded to a call from a gentleman who needed shopping tomorrow. I agreed to do it and then toggled the app to show "responded" as soon as I've done that then previous messages dissappear and I now no longer have address or contact details to sort this out tomorrow!!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:00:32__

</p>

> Dreadful. The whining alarm sound it makes to alert you of a notification is hideous, you don't want your phone making those noises esp in public. When a volunteer op pops up no information is given, I want to know more before I sign up to something. The map is very slow to load, and sometimes doesn't. I wanted to help but this app is unusable, I just wonder how many like me now won't volunteer if this is the only way to do so. Awful awful app.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 12:29:20__

> Frustrating. Isn't clear on how to volunteer as a volunteer NHS responder with no medical certification. It won't let me register without uploading a certificate (I just want one of the non-medical volunteer roles). This makes the demarcation of NHS Responder, Goodsam, and everything else confusing. I tried to upload a driving license as certificate but it just kept me on an uploading screen where it froze. I'm using an updated Android phone from 2018 so I expect my OS is fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 10:52:37__

> Confused. I received identity verification and downloaded app without any problems. However when I tried to login they asked me to verify email address which I did. Then I was informed that I had to wait (again) for identity verification! I really want to volunteer but am finding the website a tad awkward to follow, please help<br> :date: __2021-01-07 17:11:13__

> No alerts since update. Have others had this problem.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 12:40:42__

> No alerts coming through since 2.1.21. Is app faulty.<br> :date: __2021-01-07 12:36:33__

> Basic, but worked fine before. However, since Christmas time, push notifications are no longer working. The suggested solution to send a test notification or to check the FAQ is not helpful, as this does not fix the push notification issue (which is enabled as per instructions). You need to go into the app to see what the message is. If you miss the beep or are on silent, you would not know this unless you check the app every 10 mins. Developers need to resolve the notification issue with version 12.6 as this makes the app pretty much pointless.<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:23:32__

> Notifications have stopped completely after update to v12.6. I get a sound notification ONLY if I have bypass the silent mode switched to on, but no notifications on the lock screen, or at the top of the screen. Just nothing. My sounds are all turned up, including in the app. Notifications are definitely allowed, battery management is disabled, but still nothing. Is it because I'm on Android 10? Edit: it is the test push notifications via the GoodSAM website that I am using to test.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 23:45:07__

> Gave up trying to register as it will not do anything. Just keeps loading but never moves on. Such a same as I feel this has the potential to be such a good thing.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 22:03:17__

> You say the new version allows us search for upcoming volunteering opportunities? I can't see how????<br> :date: __2021-01-04 19:27:21__

> I found this app extremely frustrating. Since I signed up I haven't received any alerts or notifications. I reinstalled the app three times and still no success. The developers need to debug or reevaluate their app functionality before deployment. The NHS also should consider alternatives since GiodSAM not fit for purpose...<br> :date: __2021-01-04 15:01:56__
