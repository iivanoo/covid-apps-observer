## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Just got this app and really loved the fact that all covid19 info you need was in 1 place and easy to use great job. (was a little hard to find on google play. An app like this should be more visible)<br> :date: __2020-07-12 23:25:15__

> Very informative<br> :date: __2020-07-09 21:39:20__

> Contact tracing. Uk<br> :date: __2020-06-01 22:22:36__

> I love it 💖 so simple to use and not confusing at all, I love that everything is in one place and from the people that we should be listening to and not from misleading sources (newspapers) x I love all you over 70's that was involved in making this great app x I am 28 and I couldn't of done anything like this well done guys stay safe 💋💋<br> :date: __2020-05-27 22:54:07__

> This app is very good .<br> :date: __2020-05-26 02:43:22__

> Brilliant app! Very informative and easy to follow. Highly recommend<br> :date: __2020-05-08 13:34:16__

> Easy to use<br> :date: __2020-05-03 17:07:02__

> It's good that this information is available in one location, however please note (developers) that the physical distance required by law and for the best chance of avoiding the virus via breath, is 2 metres, not 1 metre as stated in the app. Sorry to be picky, but this is crucial information. As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

> Goof<br> :date: __2020-09-26 20:22:38__

> Great to see all the information bundled into one little package, unfortunately, because the app simply directs you to websites that are displayed within a web view, it's completely useless for offline use.<br> :date: __2020-05-30 11:49:56__

> Hi I'm not criticising your app but my avast antivirus also detected that there was malware in your app so I wasn't able to install. Maybe this is something you want to look into<br> :date: __2020-04-28 03:51:39__

> Virus checker (McAfee) alerted to a (possible) malware contained within this app. After reading other reviews of this app it appears to be a false positive, thank goodness other people had flagged this as i would of halted the install and not downloaded it. I don't believe its actually anything harmful contained within the app itself. I would given the app a 5 ⭐ except its laid out like a website from 1992. Great app though<br> :date: __2020-05-21 09:29:34__

> Here is another app that's been put on my phone and I can't use it to track if I have been near anybody with coronavirus as according to the app it doesn't work in Scotland. What the bloody point of putting this app on people's phones if they can't use it.<br> :date: __2020-08-18 09:31:46__

> Stolen content<br> :date: __2020-06-21 18:51:30__

> Turns out I didn't need an app for a mysteriously absent virus that has killed worldwide less than seasonal flu.<br> :date: __2020-06-09 10:13:17__
