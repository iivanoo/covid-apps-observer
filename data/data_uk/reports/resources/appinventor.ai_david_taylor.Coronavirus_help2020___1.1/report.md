## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Virus checker (McAfee) alerted to a (possible) malware contained within this app. After reading other reviews of this app it appears to be a false positive, thank goodness other people had flagged this as i would of halted the install and not downloaded it. I don't believe its actually anything harmful contained within the app itself. I would given the app a 5 ‚≠ê except its laid out like a website from 1992. Great app though<br> :date: __2020-05-21 09:29:34__
