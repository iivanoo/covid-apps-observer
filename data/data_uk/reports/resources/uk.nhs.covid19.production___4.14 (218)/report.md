### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. For vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community.
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus.
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features:
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district.
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test.
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app.
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is a brilliant app that's keeping everyone safe from this dreadful virus. The people who are deleting this app are selfish as you aren't keeping yourself safe but they are putting others at risk. There are a few things I think you should consider such as QR Code to check in and check out and we should be able to show our covid vaccine status. And I'm pleased to announce that my second vaccine is on the 18th August<br> :date: __2021-07-29 16:18:48__

> Is way too sensitive as I can not leave the house for days and then get told to isolate when it detects my neighbours test results. Dont need it to detect through solid walls!!! Would be nice if we could input if we have had the vaccine which would tell others and help them feel more at ease.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 12:46:31__

> App has changed language- to Turkish I think. I cannot find settings to change it back It's okay. I guessed which icon was settings and then found language options. Still don't know why it changed<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:55:18__

> struggle to upload lateral flow tests from codes and pcr need help from over the phone<br> :date: __2021-07-30 11:28:29__

> I keep reading reading the news about new features on the app, such as the "domestic" section for it to be used as a "vaccine passport", but I never seem to have any of these additions on mine. Surely updates should be implemented automatically?<br> :date: __2021-07-29 19:00:48__

> If it helps to stop people dying from Covid 👍<br> :date: __2021-07-28 10:33:21__

> The app seems to be doing its thing. No facility for recording vaccinations though which should be an essential feature one would think.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 14:37:41__

> Is it working? My partner has tested positive and yet I have not been pinged by the app ?<br> :date: __2021-07-25 09:41:22__

> Its ok but, the QR scanner doesnt work so i have to put my test results manually which can be time consuming<br> :date: __2021-07-24 15:56:52__

> The huge missing part here, when I've been advised to self-isolate, is your encounter time-of-day. You can just about find the encounter date (which is quite hidden) but not the time, which is critical to understanding how to interpret the encounter. I've been pinged based on a date when I spent most of the day on a beach but went to a bar in the evening. If the encounter was in the bar it's much more significant than if it was on the beach (indoors vs outdoors), so the time is important.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 14:37:23__

> It notifies me to turn on the app every day even if I'm not online. It should let me decide when I'm going out and stop wasting my battery when I'm not.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 18:19:17__

> This is a great app for skyving off work with pay since I installed it I've been pinged 30,000 times even though I don't go out much and live in the country.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 21:34:58__

> Can give out false positives thru Bluetooth. A bit null and void if you're double jabbed anyway.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 15:42:28__

> The check symptoms section of the app is nonsense, with a very outdated list which in no way reflects those usually experienced by infected people.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 08:49:28__

> I dont seem to be getting notifications despite me checking in. The app is still not working<br> :date: __2021-07-29 13:52:25__

> Wish I could delete both stars message listen to this folks my counter stopped working on last day of isolation I'm disabled mentally ill badly brain issues and they want to know most inane info what's my phones operating system had I taken a screenshot of countdown timer before and after it was playing up now why the devil would I do that I photo useful stuff I wouldn't think oh I will just photo the timer in case need it you don't expect it going wrong shame on you if you don't believe me<br> :date: __2021-07-27 03:28:14__

> First ping I had I was apprently exposed on a day I spent with 3 friends, all day. None of them got pinged. I isolated, did a pcr, negative. I've then been pinged and told I was exposed while I was in isolation? No faith that this app works, there is no legal requirement to have the app and no legal requirement to isolate from a ping.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 15:22:10__

> The app doesn't work, when you get your results there is no code on the text, if you entre the code on the email does nothing. You can't entre the code because they don't work on the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-25 21:50:07__

> Poor and expensive. Whoever is in charge of making the app needs to go to prison. Over £35 billion for an app that doesn't work properly. Hope you rot in hell you money grabbing, heartless a hole<br> :date: __2021-07-25 20:16:41__

> You sent me a reply with a link, the link only shown me what it says on screen when I get a notification, someone tested positive at a venue you recently visited etc, i want to know what venue it was so I don't go there for at least 2 weeks, not say click here for more info and all that happens is the app opens with no more info.......<br> :date: __2021-07-25 12:08:15__

> If I want to track and trace my phone will not work to take the code so will it still work ?<br> :date: __2021-07-24 14:58:47__

> I'm not even certain that the 'ping' works as it says. Apparently you have to be in contact for 15 minutes or more to be pinged, but I was in contact with a friend who had been pinged and told to isolate for at least 2 hours whilst going over to help bring her shopping in, put it away and clean her flat. Surely it should have pinged me as well for being in contact with her, or is this incorrect?<br> :date: __2021-07-24 13:23:11__

> Used for checking into venues but was annoying that there was never a check out option. Unfortunately I caught covid but I never got a ping, I tested because I got mild symptoms. I stayed at home with my housemate for 10 days - he never got a ping either, and the usual reply that obviously didn't meet the "2 metres for 15 mins" come on when people live together that isn't a valid excuse. No where wants you to check in now, so afraid can't see the point of this battery draining app now. DELETED.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 11:16:07__

> My experience with this app it's doesn't work not only that trying to keep people safe I get that but been told to self isolate how much isolation you think I need because I suffer from agoraphobia so my life is isolated up to the ying yang thank you for letting me know I'm doing a good job so far 4 year 8 months and counting cheers<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:36:39__

> No covid pass ports.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 13:36:53__

> This app is useless. I've had covid for the last few days now. Hasn't pinged anyone or alerted anyone in my household or block. I though I'd test it and went for a lo g walk about.. no pings no where. This app is a joke<br> :date: __2021-07-30 11:52:45__

> This app is a multi billion pound dysfunctional political disaster! Where did all that money go? not on an antiquated spreadsheet based app that's for sure! 😡<br> :date: __2021-07-30 10:11:26__

> Covid 19 is a cover up for brexit I have not received my test that was said 2hr I feel paranoid that the cctv england is absolutely ridiculous Testing is using dna and swabs abroad are against european council guidelines Scientists are spending tax payers money and wasting resources those in mental health and crisis are being exposed unnecessary<br> :date: __2021-07-30 06:43:52__

> For anyone who is considering getting this tool of tyranny please be advised. The notifications have no evidence behind them. This app is designed to keep you from leaving your house and that's about it. The alerts are fake and it's a dangerous tool in the hands of any government. Please do not download this app it will ruin you, your country and your liberty. This app has been created with the sole intent of using the NHS' name as a front to impose digital ID cards. Wake up people for god sake!<br> :date: __2021-07-30 02:37:11__

> If I could review this with -1000000 stars I would. Why is this shite embedded into Google settings. never use this as all you will catch is probably less dangerous than the annual flu.
