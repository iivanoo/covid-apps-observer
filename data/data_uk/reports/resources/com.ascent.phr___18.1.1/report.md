<br><b>NHS-ASSURED GP ONLINE SERVICES</b>
<br>Available at all GP practices in England:
<br>‚Ä¢ Save yourself time by booking and cancelling GP appointments ‚è∞

<br>‚Ä¢ Stay informed with 24/7 access to your GP medical record, including test results, immunisations, allergies and medications üìÅ
<br><b>ONE HEALTH RECORD. WHEN YOU NEED IT</b> 
<br>It may come as a surprise but a central record of your health doesn‚Äôt exist - your GP, hospital and other healthcare records aren‚Äôt joined up and information is not necessarily shared between them. That can make things pretty tricky, having to remember important information from memory, and explain past treatments and conditions over and over. With Evergreen Life, you can be in control and keep all your health data, including all of your GP records, in the palm of your hand - building a fully accurate and up-to-date record that you can carry with you all the time.
<br><b>WHAT‚ÄôS YOUR WELLNESS SCORE?</b>
<br>Your Wellness Score can help you understand if you‚Äôre doing all you can to stay well. The score is based on your answers to the app‚Äôs clinically-researched Wellness Checks in areas such as fitness, happiness, sleep and diet. By discovering your Wellness Score, you‚Äôll get personalised and practical insights into ways you can optimise your health and wellbeing.
<br><b>MEDICATION REMINDERS</b>
<br>Give yourself one less thing to worry about. Never forget to take your medications again with the Evergreen Life medicine app, helping you safely manage your own or your family‚Äôs health üíä
<br><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER</b>
<br>Track your health and fitness measurements, including blood pressure, body fat percentage and blood sugar levels, so you can monitor your health goals üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<br><b>SECURELY STORE YOUR DOCUMENTS</b>
<br>If you struggle to find appointment letters or your health information is difficult to manage, storing all your documents in one app can make it much easier to organise your care üì©
<br><b>SHARE WITH THOSE WHO MATTER MOST</b>
<br>Get the best care possible and give peace-of-mind to your family or health providers with secure access to your shared health information.
<br> 
<br><b>DNA TESTING: UNLOCK YOUR HEALTH SECRETS</b> ü§´
<br>With Evergreen Life DNA testing, you can find out how your genes influence your:
<br>‚Ä¢ DIET - Fuel your body with the nutrition it needs

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Evergreen Health Solutions Ltd |
| **Website**  | [http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk](http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> straightforward and useful app<br> :date: __2020-11-30 22:57:14__

> Quite a good app. All your medical info in one place. Only problem is when I send a message, no matter what it's about, I only get 'null' as a reply which isn't very helpful.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 12:17:35__

> Useful!<br> :date: __2020-11-06 23:06:27__

> Update 07-04: Originally gave this app 5 stars then after an update, it didn't work, so reduced the rating. Since 7th April I have had no issues and it seems to be working fine. Just hope this continues. UPDATE 15 Oct: Have decided to use another app, although I have to say there were only a few problems. Trouble is I don't need problems. When you're ordering meds, you want it to be plain sailing and simple. I would tentatively recommend this app but it has to work without hiccups. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:01:41__

> I have been using same from almost the first week.off course when you first released the app it had one or two problems, then again which new release does not have problems. Seen a couple of comments saying difficult to understand.all I can say is that they must have a different program open to me.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 22:29:16__

> Could you let me lnow how yo record fitness results<br> :date: __2020-09-29 11:05:21__

> So much easier than waiting on hold to book an appointment :). However, parts of the interface can be confusing at times and hard to navigate. I can imagine it being difficult if you aren't tech savvy.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 12:03:38__

> Have used for a while now and found it very useful, however, recently it has stopped connecting to the server. Does anyone know the cause or have a fix?<br> :date: __2020-08-20 21:30:04__

> I can use this on my phone and laptop. This is useful.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 08:27:46__

> Edit: Although I still have no idea why I couldn't log in last time, the app is now working perfectly. It is very useful to be able to order a repeat prescription and to see medical records. Much easier than trying to get through to the surgery by phone. Evergreen Customer Services were very helpful! I installed the app on my phone but it just keeps scrolling through the 5 introductory screens and won't let me log in. It's a really good idea but no use if it's not reliable.<br> :date: __2020-08-01 14:05:06__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> not as good as it could be ,why no way of uploading documents other than pictures and why not visible to members of the surgery by default?<br> :date: __2020-12-02 13:30:55__

> when I try to make an appointment it just says no appointments available ‚Äî always. Prescription ordering works fine.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 18:28:27__

> not easy for seniors to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:46:23__

> when I want my prescription delivered,only comes up with only one pharmacy which I dont want to use,l prefer to use my local one<br> :date: __2020-11-26 09:31:51__

> takes too long to find page to order repeats.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 18:00:18__

> cant book apts now, that has disappeared off here.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 12:13:52__

> Edit: this is working again now - but only on my old phone (which is too knackered to sell so ok). My new phone runs colorOS, (realme6), which might have something to do with it. Disney+ doesn't work on it because of this... Edit: I can't get to the bit where you order a precriotion. It just buffers endlessly. 4/5/2020 Works well for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 08:25:52__

> good but needs improving<br> :date: __2020-11-22 13:36:15__

> I would like to see my records but they don't seem to be available<br> :date: __2020-11-20 14:19:30__

> Frustrating after the last update it constantly asks for the screen lock code making it very difficult to get access to the app. Is anyone else having trouble<br> :date: __2020-11-13 10:04:33__



#### 2-star reviews

<p align="center">

> over complicated if all you want to do is order a repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:06:24__

> doesn't allow to log in<br> :date: __2020-11-27 23:48:59__

> Too many irrelevant pop up links when logging in making it difficult to get to the bit I need (repeat prescription). I can get through them but others may struggle<br> :date: __2020-11-27 13:54:02__

> difficult to use<br> :date: __2020-11-27 10:15:40__

> biometric logon does not work, and last whole would not order my prescription<br> :date: __2020-11-22 12:22:00__

> Prescription function issues when trying to order. Galaxy S10. Used to work fine, now all but useless to me.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 15:03:43__

> I will leave this rating as '2' as a warning to other potential users that there is an issue. ie that sometimes the App stops recognising your password and that, despite their best endeavours and lots of communications between us, Evergreen Life have not been able to resolve this issue. Hopefully one day they will get to the bottom of it as it is otherwise a pretty good App (and the Web access is good) but there are I know other similar Apps available that are probably worth looking at first.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 11:10:45__

> Having major problems with your app it keeps logging me out I then have to reset my password this has happened twice in a week it's completely unusable now and I can't order my meds really really bad...<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:38:12__

> This was a good App till it started promoting Pharmacy2u right in the App when we were going through the first Covid peak. Unfortunately I opted for that which never worked out and I had to switch back to my old pharmacy. Since then this App continues to update repeats in a haphazard manner repeatedly bringing up the same data when I request repeats. It is sad that after a long time I am uninstalling it. Business should never be given precedence to the core functions of people using this App.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:09:34__

> The app worked fine up until very recently where now I can't do anything in it and the buttons are unresponsive. The Customer Service team recommended reinstalling the app but this did nothing.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 09:19:19__

> the worst app I have on my phone. I only have it to enable me to order repeat prescriptions and this is 10times more effort than another app our gp previously supported. in short its rubbish.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 09:59:45__

> Not the best<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:48:37__

> don't look at the comments part. sends permissions to wrong place.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:43:26__

> AVOID THIS USELESS APP This app is nothing but logging users out, doesn't accept complex passwords, unlinks your GP account and then loads up half the time without any styling. Update 2020 Just just as useless in 2019 but now with 100% more notifications to drive you up the wall. Anything I try to do on this non-functioning app it just crashes. The NHS services are also tucked away making GP services harder to find and use.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 13:03:16__

> Absolutely pants. It was fine originally but for the last year or so it freezes making it useless to me. Reloaded many times to no avail - time for me to move on.... No - I can't be bothered to ring customer services - it's an app - it doesn't work on my old phone or my new phone - plenty of alternatives out there.... Avoid.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 20:26:56__

> Absolute rubbish.I cant even opt out of automatic updates.When I try and update the app, it just says "waiting on download." It won't let me use the app unless I complete the update so now I am stuck.Absolutely stupid way to design an app.Useless!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-10-31 18:14:42__

> Atrocious app. Won't let me log in when I know 100% that my credentials are correct. When I click to reset the password, it does nothing. How can we ever log in then?!? Awful.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 15:30:51__

> Only wanted to make doctor's appointment. Too many extras. Are they mining data?<br> :date: __2020-10-13 21:02:41__

> My phone has facial recognition: does this app? No, don't be silly. It's all in a Google Security API that no 'developer' is able to understand yet. Agree about the interface; it is very poorly thought out. And it's not about me, is it? It's about selling services. Don't you just hate what's happening with our NHS?<br> :date: __2020-10-13 19:25:24__

> Finger print password does not work and it's the default setting<br> :date: __2020-10-08 10:11:52__
