### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Your app thinks my phone is a tablet. Edit: After changing the display size back to default it let me load it up and it seems to be working even when I change the display size back to my preferred setting.

> Simple enough although I'm not sure how well it works in reality. Checking into a venue is quick and simple, so I like that. However, it currently shows a notification but there isn't one. it just won't go away... it's rather annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 18:42:04__

> QR scanner needs to be able to read fastflow qr code. UPDATE: Rubbish reply from NHS. Make this app really useful. Let the publuc use it to register both positive and negative test results, including fast flow results. Make its QR reader able to read the QR codes on fast flow devices. Let it link to your NHS number and also let it track/log your vaccinations. This app should be the one-stop place to log/manage all personal covid data and information. Come on NHS, you can do better!<br> :date: __2021-05-11 23:40:22__

> I've been using this on my phone - told that this was not available for my slightly older tablet. This was likely to under-represent groups that might be at greater risk (older, poorer, etc). They seem to have remedied this (in time to act as a passport to pubs?). However, I report results 2x a week; not possible here, instead requiring a separate log in to gov.uk. Let's be clear, this is not a world beating test & trace app - it's a surveillance tool. That's fine, but not rateable at this end!<br> :date: __2021-05-11 18:33:25__

> I'm wondering why I can't report the result of the Rapid Antigen Test using the app. I've had a few instances where it's got a notification continually saying "loading", but if it's saving lives then I suppose it's better than nothing.<br> :date: __2021-05-11 18:20:22__

> Im sorry but I've had the app for a while and found out my freind who I was in contact with had covid and yet my phone didn't alert me you need to sort this out please<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:22:27__

> the interface is awkward and clumsy, also sometimes I get red indication on app but when I check, nothing. it doesn't inspire confidence<br> :date: __2021-05-08 15:11:54__

> I have tried to enter the result of my Covid test. I was asked to enter the code that was listed on the email received which gave the result. My phone rejected the code, saying that it was not recognised. I checked the code several times, each with the same result<br> :date: __2021-05-07 15:27:16__

> Please add I'm home button to disable app running in the background asking for Bluetooth to be switched on constantly. I only want to use the app when I'm outside. Thanks.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 14:39:27__

> Leaves a notification on the phone saying loading and battery life seems to have gone down so uninstalling it. Load it when I have to and uninstall afterwards.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 16:47:37__

> NHS app stops my phone connecting to my car. Rather annoying, hands free doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-05 12:24:14__

> OK thank you<br> :date: __2021-05-11 12:32:27__

> Checked into a venue on the 9th may then immediately got a alert saying I needed to isolate as had been in contact with a positive case. I was only being told to isolate till midnight on that same day. Checked through the app found I'd been in contact on the 29th April. I'd not had any notification until I'd used the app on the 9th. I've asked around and others have only found out they should be isolating when they've open the app. Not very helpful! And yes I have the latest version installed.<br> :date: __2021-05-10 12:49:20__

> I'm enjoying the contrast of the "loading" notifications I get every time I look at my phone with the review and GitHub responses claiming it's been fixed. Here's an idea: if users are still reporting it, you haven't fixed it, even if you say that you have. That's how truth works.<br> :date: __2021-05-10 05:13:43__

> The app has downloaded however it will not allow me to check into venues and tells me this is unsupported. I have a Samsung M31 running on android 11?<br> :date: __2021-05-09 11:11:18__

> Having issues with it, will not let me enter my recent result which makes me unconfident about it's ability to inform me if I am exposed to someone who is positive but unable to enter the result<br> :date: __2021-05-08 01:47:19__

> Very difficult to use, especially to report a test. I am unable to use the QR code reader. More importantly I cannot enter the ID number if they begin with the letter 'L'<br> :date: __2021-05-06 15:34:11__

> Can't report a test on this site using the number on the strip, as the number is not valid also no option to scan the QR code.<br> :date: __2021-05-06 12:31:27__

> I cannot enter the test strip successfully the first 2 and last characters cannot be entered either manually or by paste<br> :date: __2021-05-05 10:11:37__
