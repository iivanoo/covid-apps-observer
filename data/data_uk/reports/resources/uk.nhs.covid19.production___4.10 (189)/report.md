### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is OK but I would like an option to activate it when I leave my house. It keeps sending me reminders because I've turned Bluetooth off, but I don't want to have my BT on all the time when I'm working from home and not going anywhere. Could you have an option to set a home location and then have it automatically activated when I'm not at that location?<br> :date: __2021-05-24 17:14:44__

> We are being asked to take lateral flow tests 2 times a week but the app does not accept home lateral flow test strip code so cannot report result<br> :date: __2021-05-30 12:42:43__

> Why isnt it compatible with the Scotland QR codes? :( Also why is is not loaded with a way to book a vaccine? Or at least links to where the closest centre is?<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:50:08__

> The contract tracing part worked for me (had an alert, and know who triggered it) but there are still issues: I've had two tests (both at test centres, both negative) but could not enter the results as the app wouldn't recognise any codes I got; as others have mentioned there's still no way to check out of a venue having checked in; finally, it's not clear to me how vaccinations are going to be recorded for proof of status - batch and NHS number (so much for not identifying users)?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 08:20:51__

> Im not sure I trust this applications security as having to leave your Bluetioth open is generally a big risk. The apps usage is reletively easy.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 10:37:22__

> Drains phone battery very fast<br> :date: __2021-05-25 19:16:20__

> Should be able to manually enter location.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 13:56:08__

> Works, but drains my battery, my charging time is really long when this app is installed. After uninstalling, my charging went back to normal.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 12:30:07__

> The app used to work great. But recently no matter what codes I try, the app doesn't seem to register them.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 09:43:46__

U send texts I put in the code & part of post code, few days later saying my isolation is over get phone call from Track n Trace asking me strange questions i.e the runs, rash! She didn't know the 3main symptoms. Pointless! Soon isolation will be over but I'm still suffering flu symptoms, all my bones hurt, 10days is not enough time to recover.

> The app does what it's meant to ok but honestly, what a fuss to do a simple check in. Must have bluetooth and location on before it will even let you in. Surely this could be optional as I'm never anywhere close enough to anyone to worry about catching this thing these days!<br> :date: __2021-05-26 12:02:03__

> Horrifically made<br> :date: __2021-05-30 11:32:34__

> Uninstalling right now. Useless, stops other apps from working, endless notifications to turn Bluetooth and location on, which drains battery at light speed. Nowhere to enter my jab details and hasn't alerted me to at least 3 different recent outbreaks I didn't know about. Useless faff, read enough reviews which state the same issues as I, and the replies from the department of health are shockingly ignorant and insulting. Terrible app<br> :date: __2021-05-30 10:56:59__

> The idea of the app is fantastic, the advise given is very poor. Wouldn't book a slot that was available despite being half hour before the slot time. Spike to 119 who said it was too short notice. Why display and have slots available that you cannot book. Also if you have been contacted by track and trace and have to self isolate, why does a negative test not superseed this advise<br> :date: __2021-05-30 10:46:43__

> OK I'm prepared to accept using this app for the benefit of helping defeat covid. However it needs to allow you to read notifications without having to turn on location and Bluetooth. I won't turn on location at home since I don't wish to share Edit 18.03.21. Now down to 2* since you seem totally incapable of answering the question above. Turned on BT but app won't open unless location is turned on. Cannot receive any notifications. Useless.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 09:02:39__

> The app won't work. Just a black screen and then it crashes!<br> :date: __2021-05-30 00:39:48__

> Dirt Pure Dirt<br> :date: __2021-05-29 21:39:10__

> Despite our area being level 4 for over a year, this app never notified us, not even once of any confirmation of diagnosis, we even tried it when a friend contracted covid... The app didn't work if this response is correct, the app did not work...<br> :date: __2021-05-29 18:35:10__

> Waste of time does not work most of the time<br> :date: __2021-05-29 18:04:48__
