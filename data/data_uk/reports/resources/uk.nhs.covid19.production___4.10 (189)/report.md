### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

I've had that loading symbol on my phone now for three days, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Had it there for a week before, then I got bored of it. Other than that, seems a good little app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 09:24:12__

> It is for keeping updated in my area. It isn't updated very often.<br> :date: __2021-05-22 12:07:01__

> Annoying<br> :date: __2021-05-20 21:27:52__

> Annoying. Get pop ups "alerts" on my phone that disappear as soon as tap to look at them. Next door got Covid-19, app told me I was infected, despite never being in contact with them other than by text. Waste of NHS resources tbh ..<br> :date: __2021-05-20 20:16:05__

> Was very cross today when the app had disappeared off my tablet what's point of track and trace when you come to use it and it's gone had to reput it on<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:09:32__

> Recently relocated quite a distance to discover there's no way to change your postcode on this app when you move house. Now the location information is out of date and useless.<br> :date: __2021-05-19 20:16:26__

> Had to uninstall as every I switched on it crashed my phone!<br> :date: __2021-05-19 07:58:09__

> Now does not allow me to stop scanning for an indefinite period, max 12 hrs. I live alone, I do not go near people, I might go into the local village or a shop once a week. I don't need it on very often I have blocked all notifications.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 19:09:58__

> When you try to scan the app, while checking in at a venue, it doesn't respond<br> :date: __2021-05-18 15:18:31__

> Others, like me, have been confused about which app to use to show your vaccination record. NOTE: You need the standard NHS app, linked to your medical records, to show that, NOT this one. My vaccination records show clearly in the NHS app.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 11:25:44__

> The app wouldn't even recognise the letter l meaning that the test results were impossible to put in. And considering we had to buy a new phone to get the app. The app is downright useless for us<br> :date: __2021-05-22 17:07:06__
