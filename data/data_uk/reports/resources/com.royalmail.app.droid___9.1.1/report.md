## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Royal Mail Group |

| **Email** | appfeedback@royalmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app. can track and trace my packages very quickly and easily !!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 11:49:46__

> quick and easy to track a package<br> :date: __2021-07-08 08:29:38__

> filling in details and getting the app to accept ie took 12 attempts to get telephone number acceptd before continuing to next line. Total frustration when the objective is to SAVE TIME.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 12:59:57__

> Cannot be beat<br> :date: __2021-07-04 12:43:28__

> It works for me, for the functions I use.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 09:55:35__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:18:18__

> room for improvement but, highly useful<br> :date: __2021-06-26 10:51:14__

> Good service all round<br> :date: __2021-06-26 09:52:55__

> Used only for parcel tracking. Works fine for that<br> :date: __2021-06-24 15:18:44__

> it works well it's really good being able to c where your package is.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 08:39:17__

> Already had a Royal Mail account from having bought stamps some years back and so it was fairly easy installing and setting up. setting up a redelivery was fairly easy and a tracking number in a text message opens seamlessly in the app. Great thus far.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:27:47__

> quite buggy at times<br> :date: __2021-07-06 13:17:00__

> Logs me out almost every time which is frustrating, on a few occasions transactions have failed yet I still got charged for postage. No email confirmations or anything. It is easy to use and navigate through but its somewhat buggy and needs a bit more stability in regards to making payments and logging in.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 01:56:41__

> Simple and straight forward, however having to manually add your sending address for every parcel is more hassle than it should be<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:13:38__

> I don't know what is going on with this app,is give me this message.... the session expired..please login again,if you are not use the royal mail app for a while, everything else is working without any problems,please sort out this problem,thank you<br> :date: __2021-06-28 23:31:36__

> Good. ..<br> :date: __2021-06-18 00:29:05__

> Keeps saying sorry you've logged out on start up. Just simply ask for log in<br> :date: __2021-06-15 10:53:58__

> OK, but not live tracking like many other delivery companies.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 09:58:56__

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> Had a parcel redirected to local post office on Thursday so I could collect Saturday . Got an email saying that it would be their , so went do at 10 o'clock an the reference on the email is not recognised by post office .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 12:19:24__

> Tracking never works! only ever tells me that an item has been delivered. Also now have to login everytime which is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 10:35:05__

> Does not work on my Samsung<br> :date: __2021-06-30 08:55:33__

> Very poor app I have had parcels delivered but the app says sorry we have no information on this delivery try again tomorrow? I've also tried tracking a new delivery only to get the same message I've used this app for a very long time now but since the latest update everything has gone down hill. What good is a tracking app that doesn't track.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 11:59:08__

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> A little tricky to navigate, card received for a parcel but with no tracking number, nor anyway of getting feedback eg:with an online help assistant, which would be enormously useful.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 14:41:16__

> Trying to re book a delivery and when you have to confirm at the end all I get is an error message. The app is rubbish it doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:11:28__

> Tries to go through send process but everyone I tapped confirm button it would open the same page again<br> :date: __2021-06-03 12:07:13__

> Royal mail is rubbish especially when delivering anything from Moonpig for family and friends. Get notification saying delivered on 22nd, luckily I checked with my friend today as card I sent was not received by her. Your service is utter rubbish<br> :date: __2021-05-23 09:44:37__

> It's usable, but normally takes a lot of input to get anything done. I'd probably rate it 3 or 4 stars, but it's just so far off the dpd app.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 12:29:47__

> Seems totally incapable of tracking my parcel, so what's the point?<br> :date: __2021-07-10 13:40:15__

> You need an account to do basic things like work out the ever changing hours the post office is open? Can't be bothered. Unistalled.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 12:41:51__

> I can never get an update of where my parcel is unlike other carrier's.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 01:11:58__

> Terrible why not be like every other delivery app and NOT have a sign in I struggled to EVEN create an account since it doesn't tell you what's wrong with the password you've entered an hour wasted because I was forced to create a damn account I wish I could 0 stars :(<br> :date: __2021-07-09 21:28:40__

> Rubbish absolutely rubbish<br> :date: __2021-07-09 18:54:36__

> Ended up using the website instead of the app. The address should be amendable, currently forced to used address search. Thus Could not use this app. Also meeds other improvements<br> :date: __2021-07-09 17:53:57__

> Parcel was two days' late being delivered as it was sent to the wrong sorting office - very unhappy as it missed my friends birthday.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 08:56:56__

> Absolutely useless, couldn't get past set up stage<br> :date: __2021-07-08 17:53:59__

> Trash, Garbage, Useless doesn't do anything at all especially live tracking. At least have a delivery option so that I don't need to ever worry about redelivery. I am tired of them taking my parcels back when there's an empty recycling bin and I got kind neighbours.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 17:48:22__

> Its garbage tracking has stopped working all the time<br> :date: __2021-07-08 17:28:16__
