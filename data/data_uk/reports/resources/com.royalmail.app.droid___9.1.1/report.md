## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Royal Mail Group |

| **Email** | appfeedback@royalmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Working OK now<br> :date: __2021-07-22 13:59:45__

> Great app. Does what it says on the tin. No issues for me as I'm not expecting it to do something it's not designed to do. Im amazed people are moaning about covid postboxes being closed and them having to walk 40 mins! It's hardly a marathon and if you read the instructions on the home kit correctly you can arrange a free courier collection from anywhere in the country. Also why order a home kit if you know the post box has been closed nine years!!<br> :date: __2021-07-21 04:06:54__

> Does job<br> :date: __2021-07-16 10:20:04__

> Good service for keeping your eye 👁 on a delivery<br> :date: __2021-07-16 08:05:05__

> Its been good for me not perfect but worth 4stars in my experience.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 18:22:57__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because sometimes the numbers for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem, but it reduces the usefulness of the tracking app if one can't use it to track common classes of mail; note that 2nd class parcels don't have tracking numbers, but reference numbers).<br> :date: __2021-07-13 18:39:20__

> Great app. can track and trace my packages very quickly and easily !!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 11:49:46__

> Keeps getting redelivery addresses mixed up. Very dissapointing.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 19:05:52__

> waiting in for a four hour delivery window. half an hour before it expires get a text to say not coming. doesn't matter, the world still turns but annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 10:45:50__

> Delivery card contained delivery officer initial and duty# but no reference #. The system isn't joined up as it didn't allow me to provide that info. It got me to install the app and grab my personal info of course... ? App simply indicated an error when I tried to schedule a redelivery date but gave no reason. Update: useful to find priority post boxes for Covid tests. Even then it's a GUI screwup as it's ambiguously under "find a drop off location" from which PO collects - like a postbox.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 15:42:40__

> Gets the job done, but annoying that you need to type your OWN address in and pay individually (even when logged in) EVERY TIME. Also be nice if you could do international postage.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 10:22:13__

> Wuuzz<br> :date: __2021-07-17 15:58:04__

> Very slow on updating the tracking side of things.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 09:57:35__

> Fix error when looking at send history. Every item shows message 'Sorry, an error occurred while processing your request'<br> :date: __2021-07-13 12:05:06__

> The proof of postage section is no longer working. I get an error when accessing it. Please fix as soon as possible as I need to supply proof to a customer.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 22:49:04__

> It was good but now I cant even open the app now, checked if it needs to be updated but all updated and still nothing<br> :date: __2021-07-12 17:26:03__

> Already had a Royal Mail account from having bought stamps some years back and so it was fairly easy installing and setting up. setting up a redelivery was fairly easy and a tracking number in a text message opens seamlessly in the app. Great thus far.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:27:47__

> App is fine, but didn't like how you inverted the checkboxes for not receiving spam from you. Obviously you did it to trick people, who click through the account creation, without reading. I also believe it goes against GDPR rules, as it should be a user action to opt-in into receiving messages, and at the moment you have to click to opt-out.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 09:57:51__

> There needs to be more options in regards to redelivery options and also once you booking a redelivery it doesn't update the history of redelivery. The app can do much better if there's proper ways taken to manage it.<br> :date: __2021-07-26 19:57:42__

> a bit of a black hole on information. I keep getting messages when items are "sent" by people but in reality that doesn't mean royal mail actually have the item, or that it's moving anywhere. no where near as good as DPD, who are the market leaders in app delivery information.<br> :date: __2021-07-24 16:54:29__

> I was able to track progress every step of the way from Italy until the item was passed to Royal Mail, then apart from an apology, nothing. I'll have to cross my fingers and hope it gets delivered.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 10:12:20__

> I was told the parcel was to be delivered on Tues 20th and made arrangements to be in, when in fact it was actually delivered on thurs 22nd.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 16:15:22__

> track and trace is pointless. when you enter your track and trace number , it just replies, we haven't tried to deliver your item yet so we can't track it...🤣🤣🤣🤣<br> :date: __2021-07-22 10:44:32__

> live tracking (like amazon) would be great. also I recieved a notification today (19th) to say my package has been delivered .... on the 17th. Correct date but what's the point telling me two days later!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 11:32:59__

> Won't let me view past orders in sending history to print off postage labels just says an error has occurred<br> :date: __2021-07-14 15:41:06__

> I don't like the fact that you give the seller a tracking number on ebay that ROYAL MAIL CAN'T EVEN TRACK OR GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICE.<br> :date: __2021-07-13 13:19:57__

> Had arranged redirection to PO but an attempt was made to deliver to house. The app shows the instruction clearly. Very annoying. Don't dare risk Nother arrangement. Would be good to know when ordering if it is going via Royal Mail so we could order elsewhere.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 14:49:31__

> I was assured my Delivery is on it way. now one entire day wasted. again this morning again I was assured it will be with me shortly and they don't know why I didn't receive yesterday it's now 13:20 making it 4 hours waiting.<br> :date: __2021-07-30 14:18:05__

> The app doesn't know what's going on....Royal Mail's promise is to attempt delivery when you're asleep or not in... guaranteed...<br> :date: __2021-07-30 10:37:33__

> Delivery is always late and never comes on guaranteed time.<br> :date: __2021-07-29 13:58:21__
