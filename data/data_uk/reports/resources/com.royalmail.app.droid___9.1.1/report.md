## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Royal Mail Group |

| **Email** | appfeedback@royalmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Does job<br> :date: __2021-07-16 10:20:04__

> Good service for keeping your eye 👁 on a delivery<br> :date: __2021-07-16 08:05:05__

> Its been good for me not perfect but worth 4stars in my experience.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 18:22:57__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because sometimes the numbers for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem, but it reduces the usefulness of the tracking app if one can't use it to track common classes of mail; note that 2nd class parcels don't have tracking numbers, but reference numbers).<br> :date: __2021-07-13 18:39:20__

> Great app. can track and trace my packages very quickly and easily !!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 11:49:46__

> quick and easy to track a package<br> :date: __2021-07-08 08:29:38__

> filling in details and getting the app to accept ie took 12 attempts to get telephone number acceptd before continuing to next line. Total frustration when the objective is to SAVE TIME.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 12:59:57__

> Cannot be beat<br> :date: __2021-07-04 12:43:28__

> It works for me, for the functions I use.<br> :date: __2021-06-30 09:55:35__

> Wuuzz<br> :date: __2021-07-17 15:58:04__

> Very slow on updating the tracking side of things.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 09:57:35__

> Fix error when looking at send history. Every item shows message 'Sorry, an error occurred while processing your request'<br> :date: __2021-07-13 12:05:06__

> The proof of postage section is no longer working. I get an error when accessing it. Please fix as soon as possible as I need to supply proof to a customer.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 22:49:04__

> It was good but now I cant even open the app now, checked if it needs to be updated but all updated and still nothing<br> :date: __2021-07-12 17:26:03__

> Already had a Royal Mail account from having bought stamps some years back and so it was fairly easy installing and setting up. setting up a redelivery was fairly easy and a tracking number in a text message opens seamlessly in the app. Great thus far.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:27:47__

> quite buggy at times<br> :date: __2021-07-06 13:17:00__

> Logs me out almost every time which is frustrating, on a few occasions transactions have failed yet I still got charged for postage. No email confirmations or anything. It is easy to use and navigate through but its somewhat buggy and needs a bit more stability in regards to making payments and logging in.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 01:56:41__

> Simple and straight forward, however having to manually add your sending address for every parcel is more hassle than it should be<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:13:38__

> I don't know what is going on with this app,is give me this message.... the session expired..please login again,if you are not use the royal mail app for a while, everything else is working without any problems,please sort out this problem,thank you<br> :date: __2021-06-28 23:31:36__

> live tracking (like amazon) would be great. also I recieved a notification today (19th) to say my package has been delivered .... on the 17th. Correct date but what's the point telling me two days later!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 11:32:59__

> Won't let me view past orders in sending history to print off postage labels just says an error has occurred<br> :date: __2021-07-14 15:41:06__

> I don't like the fact that you give the seller a tracking number on ebay that ROYAL MAIL CAN'T EVEN TRACK OR GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICE.<br> :date: __2021-07-13 13:19:57__

> Had arranged redirection to PO but an attempt was made to deliver to house. The app shows the instruction clearly. Very annoying. Don't dare risk Nother arrangement. Would be good to know when ordering if it is going via Royal Mail so we could order elsewhere.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 14:49:31__

> Had a parcel redirected to local post office on Thursday so I could collect Saturday . Got an email saying that it would be their , so went do at 10 o'clock an the reference on the email is not recognised by post office .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 12:19:24__

> Tracking never works! only ever tells me that an item has been delivered. Also now have to login everytime which is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 10:35:05__

> Does not work on my Samsung<br> :date: __2021-06-30 08:55:33__

> Very poor app I have had parcels delivered but the app says sorry we have no information on this delivery try again tomorrow? I've also tried tracking a new delivery only to get the same message I've used this app for a very long time now but since the latest update everything has gone down hill. What good is a tracking app that doesn't track.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 11:59:08__

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> A little tricky to navigate, card received for a parcel but with no tracking number, nor anyway of getting feedback eg:with an online help assistant, which would be enormously useful.<br> :date: __2021-06-16 14:41:16__

> I have click and drop on my pc which work's fine. After installing app it refuses to recognise my log in details. If I try to re-register it says my email address is already registered!!?? Have tried changing password, re-installing app etc. Useless! Have given up and deleted app. A few months on and the app still doesn't recognise my login details so have deleted it again!!!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 12:26:07__

> Royal Mail lost my parcel, an I Phone 8, and then gave me £50 as recompense. On the website it still says (ironically) that 'We've got your parcel'. They used to be trustworthy, now the only thing you can trust is it will not get there on time, that's if it does!<br> :date: __2021-07-18 19:52:58__

> Bloody useless, app wouldn't accept any passwords when trying to set it up . Uninstalled<br> :date: __2021-07-17 08:00:15__

> Entered tracking number & all I get is "sorry we haven't tried to deliver this yet" message?? I already know that! That's why I've put the tracking number in!!<br> :date: __2021-07-16 22:35:03__

> rubbish, inaccurate as usual, purposely gives earlier delivery date and time then changes it on day just to get points for statistical purposes<br> :date: __2021-07-16 09:34:39__

> How is it possible to make a junk app even more junk every update? Now it cant even track its own GB codes accross the UK, while third party apps made by a 12 year old can track all the way from Changsha to my door. I guess its like everything else British its only set up to steal data from people and nothing else 😬<br> :date: __2021-07-16 06:50:17__

> iam not happy as iv not received my parcel yet and it was ment to be delivered on 13 of July and iv still not got it yet<br> :date: __2021-07-15 23:22:31__

> Does no more than the site. Useless<br> :date: __2021-07-15 18:22:29__

> Can't sign up.<br> :date: __2021-07-15 02:58:20__

> I am being sent a message from royal mail saying they delivered a parcel to me no tracking number and no card through the door so if I have a parcel where is it royal mail I am very disappointed I'm fed up of this message with no parcel<br> :date: __2021-07-14 19:53:49__
