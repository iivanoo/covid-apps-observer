## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Royal Mail Group |

| **Email** | appfeedback@royalmail.com |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Oreo, version 8.0.0 (API level 26) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Working OK now<br> :date: __2021-07-22 13:59:45__

> Great app. Does what it says on the tin. No issues for me as I'm not expecting it to do something it's not designed to do. Im amazed people are moaning about covid postboxes being closed and them having to walk 40 mins! It's hardly a marathon and if you read the instructions on the home kit correctly you can arrange a free courier collection from anywhere in the country. Also why order a home kit if you know the post box has been closed nine years!!<br> :date: __2021-07-21 04:06:54__

> Does job<br> :date: __2021-07-16 10:20:04__

> Good service for keeping your eye 👁 on a delivery<br> :date: __2021-07-16 08:05:05__

> Its been good for me not perfect but worth 4stars in my experience.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 18:22:57__

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because sometimes the numbers for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem, but it reduces the usefulness of the tracking app if one can't use it to track common classes of mail; note that 2nd class parcels don't have tracking numbers, but reference numbers).<br> :date: __2021-07-13 18:39:20__

> Great app. can track and trace my packages very quickly and easily !!<br> :date: __2021-07-10 11:49:46__

> quick and easy to track a package<br> :date: __2021-07-08 08:29:38__

> filling in details and getting the app to accept ie took 12 attempts to get telephone number acceptd before continuing to next line. Total frustration when the objective is to SAVE TIME.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 12:59:57__

> Delivery card contained delivery officer initial and duty# but no reference #. The system isn't joined up as it didn't allow me to provide that info. It got me to install the app and grab my personal info of course... ? App simply indicated an error when I tried to schedule a redelivery date but gave no reason. Update: useful to find priority post boxes for Covid tests. Even then it's a GUI screwup as it's ambiguously under "find a drop off location" from which PO collects - like a postbox.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 15:42:40__

> Gets the job done, but annoying that you need to type your OWN address in and pay individually (even when logged in) EVERY TIME. Also be nice if you could do international postage.<br> :date: __2021-07-21 10:22:13__

> Wuuzz<br> :date: __2021-07-17 15:58:04__

> Very slow on updating the tracking side of things.<br> :date: __2021-07-14 09:57:35__

> Fix error when looking at send history. Every item shows message 'Sorry, an error occurred while processing your request'<br> :date: __2021-07-13 12:05:06__

> The proof of postage section is no longer working. I get an error when accessing it. Please fix as soon as possible as I need to supply proof to a customer.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 22:49:04__

> It was good but now I cant even open the app now, checked if it needs to be updated but all updated and still nothing<br> :date: __2021-07-12 17:26:03__

> Already had a Royal Mail account from having bought stamps some years back and so it was fairly easy installing and setting up. setting up a redelivery was fairly easy and a tracking number in a text message opens seamlessly in the app. Great thus far.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:27:47__

> quite buggy at times<br> :date: __2021-07-06 13:17:00__

> Logs me out almost every time which is frustrating, on a few occasions transactions have failed yet I still got charged for postage. No email confirmations or anything. It is easy to use and navigate through but its somewhat buggy and needs a bit more stability in regards to making payments and logging in.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 01:56:41__

> I was able to track progress every step of the way from Italy until the item was passed to Royal Mail, then apart from an apology, nothing. I'll have to cross my fingers and hope it gets delivered.<br> :date: __2021-07-23 10:12:20__

> I was told the parcel was to be delivered on Tues 20th and made arrangements to be in, when in fact it was actually delivered on thurs 22nd.<br> :date: __2021-07-22 16:15:22__

> track and trace is pointless. when you enter your track and trace number , it just replies, we haven't tried to deliver your item yet so we can't track it...🤣🤣🤣🤣<br> :date: __2021-07-22 10:44:32__

> Had first requested redelivery.Found difficult to find without app.And in Covid mode extremely lengthy process arranging services like redelivery for inform aged real pergatory!Does not ever update at all basically ap is a shambles.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 14:21:24__

> live tracking (like amazon) would be great. also I recieved a notification today (19th) to say my package has been delivered .... on the 17th. Correct date but what's the point telling me two days later!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 11:32:59__

> Won't let me view past orders in sending history to print off postage labels just says an error has occurred<br> :date: __2021-07-14 15:41:06__

> I don't like the fact that you give the seller a tracking number on ebay that ROYAL MAIL CAN'T EVEN TRACK OR GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICE.<br> :date: __2021-07-13 13:19:57__

> Had arranged redirection to PO but an attempt was made to deliver to house. The app shows the instruction clearly. Very annoying. Don't dare risk Nother arrangement. Would be good to know when ordering if it is going via Royal Mail so we could order elsewhere.<br> :date: __2021-07-12 14:49:31__

> Had a parcel redirected to local post office on Thursday so I could collect Saturday . Got an email saying that it would be their , so went do at 10 o'clock an the reference on the email is not recognised by post office .<br> :date: __2021-07-03 12:19:24__

> Tracking never works! only ever tells me that an item has been delivered. Also now have to login everytime which is extremely annoying.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 10:35:05__

> This item has been sat in the local delivery office (less than 1.5 miles away!!!) for 3 days . It's not a big parcel and I have now received 3 different alerts that it's due for delivery. This is fairly typical of this service. Not impressed (which is also fairly typical). Private delivery services do much better - perhaps there is something to be learned from them ...???<br> :date: __2021-07-23 07:42:04__

> Track something nah just an excuse why updates may not be available disappointing for a delivery service<br> :date: __2021-07-22 08:21:03__

> Hardly a tracking app, when you can't track a parcel until its been delivered!<br> :date: __2021-07-21 18:19:19__

> Bad cannot even get my name inputted !<br> :date: __2021-07-21 16:48:36__

> Less functionality than the website if you don't have an account<br> :date: __2021-07-19 16:30:28__

> Next to useless.<br> :date: __2021-07-19 16:24:55__

> never deliver on time always losing the parcels or letters the company don't deserve the name Royal Mail<br> :date: __2021-07-19 14:06:37__

> I have click and drop on my pc which work's fine. After installing app it refuses to recognise my log in details. If I try to re-register it says my email address is already registered!!?? Have tried changing password, re-installing app etc. Useless! Have given up and deleted app. A few months on and the app still doesn't recognise my login details so have deleted it again!!!<br> :date: __2021-07-19 12:26:07__
