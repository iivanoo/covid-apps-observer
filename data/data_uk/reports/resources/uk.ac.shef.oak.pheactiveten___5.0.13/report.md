### Description

The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress

<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I check my walks each day to check I am keeping up my brisk pace. I like being able to look back at previous walks. The app is so easy to use, I am very happy with it🙂.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 08:56:31__

> Like this app very much.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 23:07:10__

> Enjoy using the active 10 - has changed the way I walk my dogs (more brisk walking less gentle strolling) and I feel better for. Has a whole different dimension to just counting steps.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 12:26:18__

> Helpful to encourage aerobic exercise, although my wife's gait is somewhat shorter (so slower) than mine.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 10:53:48__

> Keeps me motivated<br> :date: __2021-02-04 23:20:10__

> Love this App, it's really helping motivate me to leave the house in a time the world isn't massively motivated x<br> :date: __2021-02-04 18:18:24__

> Tracks accurately, easy optainable goals, blog posts with useful information, very good!<br> :date: __2021-02-04 13:17:12__

> Stopped working on 3rd day saying it couldn't retrieve my walk data🤔 However, we spoke, they listened, the app was improved and voila, all good now! Thank you. Using Noom also and their pedometer/walking tracking is poor. Perhaps you should share tech with than ...😊<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:23:12__

> Get a buzz when I see my active 10s. Overall am increasing my walking. Feels worth running out to do ten mins round the block.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 19:05:35__

> This app motivates me and its good to see how much you have achieved at the end of the week<br> :date: __2021-02-02 14:40:09__

> Simple app that records minutes of brisk walking, which can be a good incentive for some.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:09:20__

> Nice and simple.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 17:14:59__

> Useful and motivational app.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 17:38:10__

> I originally gave this 5 stars but recently the app has become quite flaky and crashes on opening. Hopefully they can sort it out.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 20:55:05__

> Good app for checking whether you are actually keeping fit, very basic and simple to use. Could benefit from additional features of mapping and miles/Kms covered, but on the whole a good app.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 13:43:31__

> Helpful but obviously doesn't take account of the walking terrain. A slower walk up a steep hill still counts as 'nit brisk'. But easy to use and keep track of daily walks.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 21:40:36__

> This app has motivated me to up my walking each day. It is easy to use and effective. My only issue is that it states how many steps you have done briskly yet somehow at the end of the day it downgrades the sum. I would also like it to be linked to how many calories I'm burning.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 14:47:46__

> Easy way to check your activity.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 11:08:43__

> Easy to get to grips with, great motivation to start getting a bit more active<br> :date: __2021-01-30 11:33:59__

> I have used the app for a couple of weeks and it is easy to use. You can increase your walking time if so wish. It has motivated me to go out for a walk daily.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 18:12:13__



#### 3-star reviews

> It was working great keep me motivated until it stopped registering any steps that I had done. Also showed steps one day but were not there the next.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 07:12:57__

> It's great for motivating me to just do 20-30 mins brisk walking each day. But the minutes it records changes later in the day - reduces! So it may say I did 33 mins brisk, then suddenly it changes to 28 mins brisk - which is very annoying. If they could iron that issue out it would be great.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 09:15:50__

> Works when it works. When outside walking it picks up the motion. However it doesn't register anything other than time - often erroneously - when eg ballroom dancing or treadmill walking.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 11:54:48__

> I know I have walked brisk sometimes but the app does not alway pick it up<br> :date: __2021-01-29 10:14:37__

> Good idea I guess it got me off the sofa but it doesn't always seems to work, seems to depend on which pocket my phone is in which is slightly demotivating.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 09:12:34__

> Not been using for long. But clear and concise<br> :date: __2021-01-22 13:38:54__

> It's an ok app. As long as you have your phone in your pocket it records the time you are moving and how much of it was brisk. It does seem to lose the information from one day to another though, which is a bit annoying as you could compare your movements over the last week or months - pointless if it doesn't save continuously. The app does have information, or rather links to other areas, ie healthy eating.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 12:57:15__

> OK when it works but very frustrating when it doesn't record a walk even when the phone is being carried in exactly the same way as it always is. Is now claiming that I haven't opened the app for 39 days when I used it the preceding day. Missed recordings have happened so often now that I'm looking for an alternative.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:54:18__

> Found it really motivating but appear to have 'lost' a weeks walking!<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:12:38__

> Not consistent. The same walk everyday. The faster the walk often results in less time recognised as brisk walking!<br> :date: __2021-01-17 10:49:13__

> Recently has consistently failed to record what I know must be brisk walking given the number of people I overtake, and the distance. Am going to uninstall. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 16:21:50__

> Sometimes works sometimes doesn't.. Bit more than frustrating at times... Still the steps are done which is the point..<br> :date: __2021-02-04 12:38:59__

> Doesn't recognize brisk walking on my HTC desire 530, even if I jog and I've tried it in every pocket.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 19:11:34__

> Although it's an encouraging app, I've noticed it's not completely accurate but helps general motivational. I would be really happy if it actually measured the distances walked or run.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 14:56:11__

> Regularly does not track my brisk walking unless I hold the phone in my hand while I walk.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:53:20__

> I walked, and my walks were measured and I got a badge , great! Then walks disappeared😐uninstalled and re installed.. same thing🤷👎 Good idea, but its not working properly<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:35:42__

> Works fine on IOS but poor on Android - keeps stopping - can't adjust the target. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still same. All my other apps work fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 02:54:31__

> Really liked it for first 2 days but now day 4 it only shows first days walking and hasn't recorded that I walked at all today. It doesn't open properly but takes me back to Google Play to open it from there. I had high hopes for this and recommended it to friends but I'm now disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-01-16 01:10:29__

> Lost previous days walk data at the start of every new day. Pretty frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-01-15 08:57:10__

> Used this app really successfully until this week when it's not storing daily levels so can't compare any more. What's happened? Disappointed<br> :date: __2021-01-14 15:51:31__

> For a supposedly motivational app, this one is astonishingly demotivating! Regularly removing "Active" minutes a few hours after awarding them is not good.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:43:04__

> I have no idea what you have to do to register brisk walking. I was walking at a pace to make me breath hard and built a sweat keeping the pace steady up and down hills. Result 31 minutes 0 brisk. Tried it again. This time despite walking for a couple of hours at the weekend and one again today, the app failed to record that I had walked at all, let alone briskly. It is therefore useless. Time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 12:30:13__

> Very poor app. Have installed and used it twice now. Both times my fitbit tracker recorded over 100 minutes brisk walking. This app recorded 3 minutes the first walk, and 19 the next. I have deleted it and won't bother again.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 12:59:27__

> Hopeless. Now worse. Keeps saying I might lose data as I need to log in every 30 days. I am pleased to see the return of rewards but when are you going to get the basics to work properly? It is showing 42 mins brisk walking today though I've only just got up but nothing at all for yesterday when I went for a long brisk walk and my data for 12 days ago never did appear.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 11:21:17__

> Installed first time and registered brisk walk, next few days nothing. Unistalled the Installed again and still not registering brisk walks or steps. A good idea but not working. Now unable to register as will not accept my Post Code / email address.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:01:21__

> This use to work, it's broken now<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:37:53__

> A good app for raising blood pressure, not so good for encouraging walking. It seems to forget data despite the update. For instance on the day it says 20 minutes, look at your history and it's only 5.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:36:30__

> Loses walking data within 24 hours which is really annoying despite the update on 15th January.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:33:18__

> Broken since last update!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 07:40:26__

> Worked for first day then said update now does not keep record of each days walking not good 😒<br> :date: __2021-01-17 11:47:28__
