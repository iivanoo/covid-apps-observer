<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Very simple to use! Accurate!<br> :date: __2021-03-24 21:00:30__

> not sure if this app works properly. I'm a gardener and am active all day. according to the app one day I walked for 330 mins yet only 77 were classed as brisk..<br> :date: __2021-03-23 17:38:07__

> The app does not always record walks as brisk, when they definitely are, as measured by my speed and how out of breath I am.<br> :date: __2021-03-23 14:51:08__

> Gives you motivation<br> :date: __2021-03-22 21:21:41__

> Handy little App if you want to get moving.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 13:31:32__

> A bit hit and miss regarding recording brisk minutes<br> :date: __2021-03-20 11:28:34__

> Why does the app recognize a walk as brisk? It says if my heart beats fast during my walk this is brisk. It doesn't say I have to walk at a specific pace. I don't normally do any exercise so even a relatively slow walk can make my heart work more.<br> :date: __2021-03-17 13:51:34__

> Pretty basic, but keeps track of our daily walks during Covid it's all we need.<br> :date: __2021-03-16 19:53:41__

> Very informative and encouraging. However the app lags a lot. Sometimes it doesn't record the walks or minutes I have spent because of cellullar signal problems. :(<br> :date: __2021-03-11 12:50:35__

> Brilliant when it works but sometimes it doesn't record brisk walking even though nearly running. I think it depends a lot on which pocket it is in although today it was in my usual coat pocket and I definitely walked briskly because there was a freezing cold wind but recorded 50 mins walking only 5 brisk. On the plus side I love the rosettes and badges. I would like to be able to set for more brisk minutes than 30.<br> :date: __2021-03-10 17:55:04__

> Great app, would be a good feature if you could add your minutes in manually as it can be quite difficult to always carry the phone on your body so it can measure you walking. In the summer it will be impossible to carry the phone and push a pram or carry bags when a lot of ladies clothes don't have pockets big enough for a phone. Other than that good app<br> :date: __2021-03-07 15:29:14__

> Not reliable, I do the same walk each week in the same time sometimes it records 100 brisk minutes other times like today 8 minutes<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:45:18__

> It just doesn't register much of my brisk walking. Seems completely random, some days all is fine, other days only about 10% registers.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 17:09:46__

> Frustrating. App regularly loses all records. This did not use to happen<br> :date: __2021-03-06 11:41:19__

> My phone came with this app installed & I used it for years. Sadly it now requires me to enter a password for a samsung account which I don't have. My phone is quite old, & I imagine this is something which has come in since I got it. There seems to be no way through this, so I cannot use it any more & have lost my data. If not for this I would have given 4 stars. I found it very useful.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:39:53__

> Doesn't take into consideration somebody's starting fitness level or age. I went for a walk for 40 minutes in the snow came back sweating and out of breath. My doctor says that is a brisk walk and good for me the app size I did 5-minutes. I feel that you need to be jogging for it to say you're walking briskly. Not all bad it does tell you how long you've been walking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:04:25__

> Very disappointed that the app doesn't always count the brisk steps. If I put my phone in my pocket it counts steps but not brisk steps. I have to hold the phone in my hand for it to work properly. It took me a long while to work this out. It was helpful to read that other people had experienced the same problem and I tried holding it as a result. Nowhere on the app to discuss problems like this. When it does count accurately I find it very useful and motivating.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 13:31:15__

> A 20 minute walk is apparently 40 minutes. Unsure if this actually measures the time of the walk correctly however it definitely encourages you to be more active. I'd give it more if it was more accurate.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 21:27:37__

> Recently has consistently failed to record what I know must be brisk walking given the number of people I overtake, and the distance. Am going to uninstall. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 16:21:50__

> Sometimes works sometimes doesn't.. Bit more than frustrating at times... Still the steps are done which is the point..<br> :date: __2021-02-04 12:38:59__

> Doesn't recognize brisk walking on my HTC desire 530, even if I jog and I've tried it in every pocket.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 19:11:34__

> Not fit for purpose. Doesn't record anything.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 03:20:55__

> I loved this app when I first used it a couple of years ago but now it doesn't hold the data. It collects the day and by the next day it's gone.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 10:15:40__

> I used to think this app was good. Recently it never records anything at all, I uninstall and reinstall and it still does nothing. Ive now uninstalled it. No point<br> :date: __2021-03-18 20:18:41__

> I have been using this App for nearly two months now. I was very enthusiastic when I started, but I am very disheartened about it now. I only set myself a target of 10 mins a day, but constitently, the App is only recording a maximum of 60% of my walk as brisk. I know that I am walking far above the recommended rate for brisk walking. I have contacted Oneyou and given them my phone information. They passed this on to the developers and I am still waiting to hear back. Very disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-03-18 14:21:21__

> Very disappointed to find that the app doesn't record activities offline. Useless.<br> :date: __2021-03-07 09:02:45__

> This app still loses data even after the update to correct. Recorded my walk yesterday but when I opened the app an hour later to record data, it showed nothing for the day. No historic info is being kept for more than a few hours..<br> :date: __2021-03-05 18:15:16__

> My app has gone into a weird state and won't work anymore. Upon loading it displays a message "Oops! We don't seem to be able to access your walking data right now. Please check back later" I've already confirmed that all app permissions are enabled. Also I'd tried uninstalling/reinstalling and deleting app cache/data... all to no avail. Not clear how to seek support for this app!<br> :date: __2021-03-05 01:50:22__

> The app suddenly stopped working after 6 days. I have reinstalled it, but very disappointed as it was quite motivating.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 08:17:55__

> Easy to use app but totally inaccurate. After my last positive review I have changed my opinion. My watch and mobile can say fir instance I gave walked for two hours yet the app will say I have walked 41 minutes with 10 minutes of it brisk, it makes no sense. Initially it was accurate now its pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 18:39:00__

> Been using this for several weeks. Opened it this morning, empty, no history, nothing retained. Pissed off.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 08:21:19__
