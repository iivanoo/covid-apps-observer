### Description

The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.

<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I've persevered with the app and it improved to 5 star standard. It was used in conjunction with a Fitbit; they gave comprehensive information together, particularly when used for backpacking or trying new walks. Unfortunately the comprehensive output of the original, where you could see where active minutes were lost due to using gates, stiles bogs etc., has been replaced with a trophy icon for every 10 mins that reduces it usefulness quite considerably, without losing its core purpose.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:23:10__

> Very useful and encouraging to exercise.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:53:41__

> Wonderful software.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:42:45__

> Motivating to move. This app allows me to track how much brisk walking I've done without any kerfuffle. And keeps a record so I can see day by day week by week.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 16:45:16__

> Helps me stay on track<br> :date: __2020-11-17 13:41:04__

> Very useful. It has helped my husband immensely to recover from a heart attack in our first lockdown. As he could not have proper rehab at hospital, his recovery was very much in his hands with just telephone consults as guidance. He could track how much of his walking was brisk and improve in a sensible and safe timeframe as dictated by the hospital.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 13:12:22__

> Clear and not fussy.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 09:32:11__

> I have a problem with pedestrian crossings as I have to pause which makes it hard to do 10 minutes without stopping<br> :date: __2020-11-09 22:26:43__

> Good at recording brisk walks but overestimates normal walking. New edition much more accurate.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:23:28__

> It's quite motivating but doesn't differentiate between e.g. walking up a really steep hill and walking on a flat smooth path.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:16:45__

> OK ish<br> :date: __2020-11-19 17:11:19__

> If you exceed your target the app doesn't recognise that and tells you 'keep going' for the target.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:42:09__

> Loads quicker than the earlier version, but otherwise inferior. Needs to allow more than 30 minutes as a target, also appears to under-record brisk walking.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:47:51__

> 9 November 2020: it works better than it used to, except I keep getting messages to update, I click the update button but the update doesn't happen. So annoying. Still, this app got me walking, and I've got healthier because of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 11:15:39__

> Active 10 just did an update and got rid of all my walks! Very annoying<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:23:04__

> Why does it ask, every time it starts, to get the latest updates, when it has the latest version?? It'll be removed if it continues to annoy me.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 10:02:55__

> It is a good, useful and simple tracker. I like the use of time. Would prefer if it allowed you to set higher targets but it's good enough for me. I gave it 4 stars when I left that review but for some reason it now asks to be updated every day!! I reinstalled it to try and stop this but it wiped all my data! So now downgrading to 3 stars.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 20:04:34__

> Very useful for motivating me to exercise more. Clear and easy to use. Results are presented in a clear way. Sometimes the notifications get lost. Update November 2020: for the last few weeks it's been asking me to update every time I open it. Also reported by other users. Any plans to fix this issue?<br> :date: __2020-11-01 13:43:54__

> It used to be much better. Recently it has been telling me lies about my walking which it did on a previous version but I thought had been fixed. Such a shame. Also why does it ask me to update every single time I open it now?<br> :date: __2020-10-30 10:08:52__

> The latest version of this app is, in my opinion, inferior to its predecessor. It seems to have bugs and is less accurate in tracking brisk walking. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 18:48:02__

> It does not work offline and i hate that<br> :date: __2020-11-17 08:29:56__

> App needs tweaking. Just walked for 25 mins app says 8 mins active that's all, not recorded the other 17 mins at all, I know phone senser is working as samsung health has recorded correctly. Also it can't add up,yesterday the daily "today" says I've done "32" mins of brisk walking then tells me I've NEARLY achieved 3 x10min awards, but it shows 3 gold cups. I also get fed up of it asking me to "update" everytime I open the app, if I choose "ok" there is clearly no new update<br> :date: __2020-11-13 12:01:01__

> I like the app, it's simple and tells me exactly what I need to know. But the latest version keeps prompting to update, very annoying!!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:04:35__

> Keeps telling me an update is available. As far as I can tell Ihave already downloaded it<br> :date: __2020-11-05 13:45:47__

> Very basic, but good enough. Been using for a year now and no major problems. A few extra features would make it more useful, but then I guess complexity could compromise the quality and reliability. UPDATE: New version is buggy. It keeps saying there is an update when I am on the latest.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 10:13:24__

> App does not give distance travelled, constantly reminds about an update but if you try to update your taken to the option to download same version as already installed. Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 23:50:09__

> Doesn't register cycling big disappointment,wants to update every time I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:45:49__

> Seems a bit hit and miss since upgrade, probably by Serco. 2 people did same walk and it registers 130 mins for 1 and 237 for the other ??!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 01:08:09__

> 1850's patronising user interface<br> :date: __2020-10-09 08:02:49__

> Third time losing my progress data. I've been using app for several years and check it many times a day to see how I'm doing. (I preferred your older format which showed how much/what time each walk consisted of). No response to queries about moving my several years of data to new android mobile. (Data had previously been lost from my old mobile and took ages for me to get it reinstated.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 08:50:27__

> Cannot get app to work. It seems to get into a loop when setting up at the fitness page. I press continue and get taken back to the beginning.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 11:49:01__

> I only have a 26inch leg so my strides are short, to get it to register as a brisk walk on this app i had to jog for the10min<br> :date: __2020-11-18 12:46:23__

> Previous version was very good and accurate. Walk the same route at the same speed. Previous version 20 minutes brisk new version 5 minutes brisk. Going to uninstall. It is a waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 20:57:41__

> Since I've updated a few weeks ago, it's just not logging anything. Just keeps giving me an annoying 'oops' message.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:59:28__

> Walked very briskly for 40 minutes, and this App didn't register a single movement. It worked well for about two weeks. Very disappointed. Don't bother with this App.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 18:02:58__

> Not working.. constant update ..walking speed faulty..someone has being adjusting the app parameters.. brilliant app the way it was (pre Nov 20)<br> :date: __2020-11-09 10:09:06__

> Keep getting update pop up even though it has been updated to latest version!!<br> :date: __2020-11-02 22:49:36__

> Normally good but lately it wants to constantly update despite my changing settings on my phone. Very annoying.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 09:25:30__

> Stopped working - had been great - but all old walks lost, isnt tracking any walks just keeps saying loading or cant upload data. Nothing on the app in FAQ or help Shame as it was a useful app before it stopped working.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 11:50:05__

> Does not record brisk walking, I was almost running and it didn't record it as 'brisk'.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:06:28__
