### Description
> Active 10 is a free and easy to use walking app that tracks your walking and shows you how you can increase your intensity to benefit your health. The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress

<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is a simple but a good app. It does what it says on the tin.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 21:28:34__

> This app, recommend by my sister, has got me up and going. At first I could only do five minutes. Some days I do a lot more now, with at least ten minutes brisk walking. I do it indoors on the spot and outside. I like that it prompts me when I haven't used it and encouraged me when I do.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:00:15__

> If you want some simple recipes it is a good free app.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:13:20__

> Works well.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:38:07__

> It says 'go for a third' when you're on your fourth. Is there a way of increasing your target beyond 30 minutes?<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:26:10__

> Really useful but I do find if it is just in my pocket it doesn't always pick up brisk steps so I tend to hold my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-09 17:49:42__

> Use everyday. Find it a useful guide.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 13:57:48__

> I find this really useful and encouraging and would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that it occasionally stops working and you have to uninstall and reinstall it.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 04:19:31__

> App really helpful in terms of keeping up a good pace. Better than measuring steps. Simple and easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 21:02:14__

> This works well most days but some days doesn't record steps and brisk minutes you have done.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 18:49:02__

> Makes me go out for a walk even if I dont have much time. If I achieve my target I treat myself.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 13:07:56__

> The app has made me more active, however would be better if it showed distance walked based on an average step length.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 10:50:12__



#### 3-star reviews

> Generally good and has motivated me to get a faster pace and do that for me time. Some irritations, however. I would like to set a (much) higher target but 30 mins a day is the maximum. Also, totals seem very slow to update at times and you have to close the app and open again. E.g. Its Sunday and yet my Saturday walk was still not reflected in the weekly figurea until I shut the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 23:42:05__

> I would like the app to dostep counter as well as distance and pace record<br> :date: __2020-11-25 14:34:13__

> Reach goals every day<br> :date: __2020-11-23 20:09:33__

> OK ish<br> :date: __2020-11-19 17:11:19__

> If you exceed your target the app doesn't recognise that and tells you 'keep going' for the target.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:42:09__

> Loads quicker than the earlier version, but otherwise inferior. Needs to allow more than 30 minutes as a target, also appears to under-record brisk walking.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:47:51__

> 9 November 2020: it works better than it used to, except I keep getting messages to update, I click the update button but the update doesn't happen. So annoying. Still, this app got me walking, and I've got healthier because of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 11:15:39__

> Active 10 just did an update and got rid of all my walks! Very annoying<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:23:04__

> Why does it ask, every time it starts, to get the latest updates, when it has the latest version?? It'll be removed if it continues to annoy me.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 10:02:55__

> It is a good, useful and simple tracker. I like the use of time. Would prefer if it allowed you to set higher targets but it's good enough for me. I gave it 4 stars when I left that review but for some reason it now asks to be updated every day!! I reinstalled it to try and stop this but it wiped all my data! So now downgrading to 3 stars.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 20:04:34__

> Far too often doesn't recognised I've walked at all.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 20:26:15__

> I was enjoying this app and it was great for getting you motivated about getting out and about. I have just clicked on it and it's not showing that I did any walking for the last 2 days!! I walk to work, so it should show. It was all there yesterday, but now nothing. Seems pointless using the app of it's going to delete what I've done, that's not very motivating..<br> :date: __2020-11-29 08:23:41__

> It does not work offline and i hate that<br> :date: __2020-11-17 08:29:56__

> App needs tweaking. Just walked for 25 mins app says 8 mins active that's all, not recorded the other 17 mins at all, I know phone senser is working as samsung health has recorded correctly. Also it can't add up,yesterday the daily "today" says I've done "32" mins of brisk walking then tells me I've NEARLY achieved 3 x10min awards, but it shows 3 gold cups. I also get fed up of it asking me to "update" everytime I open the app, if I choose "ok" there is clearly no new update<br> :date: __2020-11-13 12:01:01__

> I like the app, it's simple and tells me exactly what I need to know. But the latest version keeps prompting to update, very annoying!!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:04:35__

> Keeps telling me an update is available. As far as I can tell Ihave already downloaded it<br> :date: __2020-11-05 13:45:47__

> Very basic, but good enough. Been using for a year now and no major problems. A few extra features would make it more useful, but then I guess complexity could compromise the quality and reliability. UPDATE: New version is buggy. It keeps saying there is an update when I am on the latest.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 10:13:24__

> App does not give distance travelled, constantly reminds about an update but if you try to update your taken to the option to download same version as already installed. Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 23:50:09__

> Doesn't register cycling big disappointment,wants to update every time I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:45:49__

> Seems a bit hit and miss since upgrade, probably by Serco. 2 people did same walk and it registers 130 mins for 1 and 237 for the other ??!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 01:08:09__

> Doesn't work. Walk fast every day and it's still recorded nothing!!! a<br> :date: __2020-12-10 09:49:31__

> This is the third time I have installed this app, each time it has failed, locking up, not working. I'll try for the last time Correction this is the fourth and it has frozen YET AGAIN! Given up uninstall Ed. Tried the app again, vastly over reporting the time walking. Will uninstall again when will you get it right?<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:23:50__

> Not very accurate! Came back to try the app with a new phone but it still underestimate the number of brisk minutes (in my opinion). I have to almost sprint for it to register and even then it's not very generous. It demotivates rather than encourages so I just make sure I do 30 mins of brisk walking and ignore the app!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 18:36:34__

> Not working properly, even when brisk walking, says no brisk walking, was OK, up until about 2 weeks ago.... now does not register steps correctly 🙄<br> :date: __2020-11-29 13:59:30__

> Not accurate<br> :date: __2020-11-28 23:02:54__

> Nov 2020 - decided to try app again but it crashed twice this past week and can't get any help from the developers. May 2020 - the app has again deleted all my data - which is even more upsetting given how much effort I've been making during lock down to move more. I'd give it 1/2 star now and will be looking for a new app. Previous review (Dec 2019) said the app is great but I no longer think so after my data being totally deleted.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:15:58__

> We are having real issues with this app. A 55 minute very brisk walk recently gave us only 6 minutes brisk walking and the following day showed nothing. Losing relevance rapidly!!<br> :date: __2020-11-27 10:45:56__

> Cannot get app to work. It seems to get into a loop when setting up at the fitness page. I press continue and get taken back to the beginning.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 11:49:01__

> I only have a 26inch leg so my strides are short, to get it to register as a brisk walk on this app i had to jog for the10min<br> :date: __2020-11-18 12:46:23__

> Previous version was very good and accurate. Walk the same route at the same speed. Previous version 20 minutes brisk new version 5 minutes brisk. Going to uninstall. It is a waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 20:57:41__
