## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | GoodSAM LTD |
| **Website**  | [http://www.goodsamapp.org/](http://www.goodsamapp.org/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellent & is developed continuously.<br> :date: __2021-03-08 15:15:54__

> Great app<br> :date: __2021-02-15 18:48:28__

> Upon installation, I can't seem to get past the initial introduction pages. The button at the bottom which says "Ask for permissions" does nothing when tapped. I've checked the permissions that the app has been granted in the application manager, and it has everything it needs. Phone is a Samsung J3 running Android 5.1.1. Update: Thanks to the team for updating this so quickly. All working perfectly now!<br> :date: __2021-02-03 10:32:29__

> Never leaves me alone. Works really well. Dare not sign on unless I've got a good bit of time to offer because I can easily get the next call before I've got home from the previous.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 18:54:23__

> Hi my app isn't working, I'm not getting any sound when simulating an alert and only just realised. I could of missed so many calls because of this it's not fair<br> :date: __2021-01-16 03:04:47__

> Edit: Thank you for clarifying and the quick response, that is working now! The app is not sending me notifications, I have been sent tasks but are missing them (even though I have been using my phone at the time the message is sent) because the app isn't sending my phone notifications. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times now and have checked notification and location permissions are allowed...<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:43:42__



#### 4-star reviews

> Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 06:05:24__

> Since the update, this is a good app. I still haven't had a volunteering alert for the vaccination centres yet, here's hoping!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:01:46__

> Seems to run well. Had no alerts yet since registering<br> :date: __2021-02-26 05:17:37__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> The app works ok most of the time. One problem I get is the location side, I've had to reject quite a few alerts that have been 12 miles away even though my app is set at 5 miles.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:57:46__

> The App need an audible alert when scheduled tasks appear. I have missed opportunities to volunteer due to this. Steve. NHS/RVS Volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:16:50__

> The issue I had experienced has been resolved. Now, the app is up and running on my phone as it should. Thank you 👍<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:06:29__

> I just updated as there should be a new task tab for vaccination steward volunteers. I see nothing different<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:39:42__

> Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a "double ding" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the "accept" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the "bypass silent" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one "ding" now as expected - thnx!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:48:32__

> Good Idea. But after 814 hours on duty there is no task.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:01:12__

> Cant find a decent burger .... ppppfffffff<br> :date: __2021-03-12 14:29:29__

> Have not received actual work in months. Lots of alerts about people safeguarding but when called no action required. Also I'm supposed to be a driver but haven't seen a driver call since I initially registered.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 18:26:17__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:50:54__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2021-01-29 09:28:59__

> The app tells me my certificate/ID is out of date but when I log onto the website it states it's valid until next year. Please help!<br> :date: __2021-01-29 07:30:57__

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> Can the app not give basic details on the alert as hard to know if can adequately deal with the situation? Also I assume the alert goes to everyone locally until someone responds...I hope so as I didn't get sound on notification so no idea what time it came through?<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:50:50__

> This app work fine on my phone, but my husband cannot get it to work on his Galaxy Alpha. The screen displays 'please log in' but there is nowhere to do so, and you cannot exit from the app. He really wants to volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 11:00:36__

> I have just been cleared and invited to join. I have lost my password and unable to retrieve it. What should I do?<br> :date: __2021-01-17 12:09:30__

> Keeps crashing.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:17:56__

> 1. I uninstalled the Goodsam app from my Android v10 tablet as the Task tab didn't show like on the smartphone. I was planning to reinstall to fix this bug. Now it says my tablet isn't compatible. WHY!!? It seems perverse to withdraw the tablet version. It was useful if my wife borrowed the phone. 2. I am signed up as a stewarding volunteer. It would help if you could add an alert when a task comes in. This could be the siren already in place. But as the "tasks" are less urgent an email would suffice.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 20:16:22__

> Buggy, clunky UI. Clicking on 'Show details' of a booked task closes the app every time. The details can only be seen by restarting the app. No way to go back to the homepage without clicking back through every page of the 'tasks' section. Can't copy text, eg task addresses. User unfriendly.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:22:40__

> Difficult to use efficiently<br> :date: __2021-01-29 10:37:31__

> I've been logged in for over 1000 hours and never had a notification, even though I have all notification settings turned on. I've just gone into messages to find loads saying I've not responded to a request. How can I respond if the app isn't notifying me?<br> :date: __2021-03-28 09:16:49__

> Load of rubbish. Was told by emergency Doctor from other side of my Borough to sign up to get a volunteer to collect my prescription. App wouldn't even let me state I was in the UK when registering. Tried several times. Give up. Response to developers: I was told to register by a gp to find a volunteer to collect a prescription/medication last night The App would not let me put the UK as my country! I am already registered with NHS First Responders. I get a call every couple of weeks.<br> :date: __2021-03-26 11:43:35__

> After update app no longer opens. Re installed works once and then does not open again. Now unable to access to log on<br> :date: __2021-03-24 12:12:46__

> Even though I have turned on notifications and location but the crash when ever I click on tasks.<br> :date: __2021-03-20 10:06:46__

> When ever I click on future tasks it turns off so I am unable to check or book any task<br> :date: __2021-03-19 23:36:28__

> I sign on and then think it'll send notification but it hasn't been so someone sends a request I haven't received it so goes to the next responder I'll make sure I have it loaded more often now<br> :date: __2021-03-12 19:36:31__

> I still haven't had a Volunteering alert for the Vaccination Centre in my area where I live, patiently waiting!<br> :date: __2021-03-02 15:26:33__

> Never had any notification since April 2020 to end Feb 2021. Hours clock up but not heard anything. Don't think it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:48:54__

> This app won't let me download at all I have a Samsung A20E.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 13:22:40__

> Wow, OK, so the developer response to reviews that calls out a forced square crop on the licence says "take a photo of your licence and the table it is sitting on, so you can crop a combination of the license and the background it to a square". See Richard M's review below as an example. Yet the photo of the AED allows for any size and shape crop. So the developers have figured out how to allow an any size crop for selecting one photo, but don't want to apply that to another? I'm betting that the reason I can't save my AED location is because the app doesn't just select a photo, it selects and forces a crop, and in cropping it, it probably loses the location data that is in the Exif information that I have confirmed is embedded in the original photo.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 07:00:49__
