## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This is an excellent app with key information relating to coronavirus. Everyone should download it. However, for all of the clueless wonders out there who cannot read and have left it One Star reviews because it doesn't trace, it's not supposed to trace. There is a specific, dedicated app for 'Test & Protect' in Scotland, and that is the new Scottish tracking app. Learn to read, and you may well have a better chance of doing what you need to do in order to avoid coronavirus.<br> :date: __2020-09-24 18:39:42__

> Ok<br> :date: __2020-10-24 12:35:36__

> Since there's so many NHS apps, one general for patients who may need advice for their condition, another for general health information, whilst so many 3rd parties are using their logo, can NHS not name this Scottish app with Scotland AND COVID-19 in the name so the English and Welsh people can avoid this one?<br> :date: __2020-09-25 15:59:44__

> How do i check using post code<br> :date: __2020-09-24 13:19:39__

> If you are looking for the contact tracing app you need to search for Protect Scotland - this is not the app you are looking for. Stay Safe, Be Kind.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 12:15:04__

> Very disappointed with this app, very very basic, no proximity alerts, no information where positive areas are. I really wanted this app to impress me but sadly has failed. Why not just team up with the Kings College / ZOE Covid19 app as this has more information on where the hotpots are and offers you daily check-in for symptoms to collect live data. Come on NHS Scotland you can do much better than this!<br> :date: __2020-09-03 17:22:15__

> This is too basic, and tells you nothing about covid-19 nor its wider symptoms. It just asks those 3 questions. I wonder if this is just a waste of resources.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 02:00:49__
