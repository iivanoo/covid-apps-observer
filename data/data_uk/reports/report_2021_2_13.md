The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.

<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

> Could do with more updates. But pretty good for sign posting<br> :date: __2020-06-29 12:39:16__

> Quite good app as has a symptoms checker and some info, advice and statistics.. However doesn't have what I actually downloaded it for which was to find out about updates to current regulations and recovery plan such as easing of lockdown rules etc.. Have to search for this and then visit nidirect website for this info..<br> :date: __2020-06-07 21:55:20__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-05-06 23:22:23__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is ok and as there is no alternative you can't choose anything else. I used it for checking into venues, but due to national lockdown I no longer do this. I haven't been alerted to any contacts so assume I've not had contact with anyone testing positive. The Test and Trace programme seems to have largely been an inefficient use of public money that has been ignored but many people. Perhaps a public inquiry will reveal the cost/benefit of this.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 22:58:58__

> It's fine, but kind of a mess. You cannot actually enter in any codes you get at test centers. Additionally, here are some points to improve upon: Changing location is possible but kinda hard to find. Others have issues with the app being suspended. Power management issues should be acknowledged by the app, and users should be asked to exempt the app on first start. National statistics would be nice. Also please add the option to add a shortcut to the 'scan' activity.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:45:11__

Having notifications about legislation changes is nice, but otherwise it's so poorly thought out. The main reason I signed up was for privacy-first contact tracing, but that feature requires both bluetooth *and* location permissions, which is highly suspect!

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

> Good app to have<br> :date: __2021-02-13 14:17:13__

> Easy install, anonymous and unobtrusive. No personal details required. Get alerted if you have been in close contact with anyone recently testing positive. What you choose to do then is up to you. Similarly if you have a positive test, you choose to update the app/system. A win-win for everyone, and it will help restrict and limit any spread. Update: 31st Jan 20: The app/system works. My partner got a +ve test result this morning. She entered her code and I was notified a few hours later.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 14:12:49__

> I received a notification to self-isolate back in November. When I checked the periods of exposure on the Google notification page there had been no exposure checks for several days including the day I was allegedly exposed. It turned out I was nowhere near anybody that had corvid-19. My next door neighbour had tested positive a week or so before. The Bluetooth picked up the notification through the wall.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:22:32__

> None<br> :date: __2021-01-22 22:34:21__

> An ok app but my husband and I both tested positive on the same day. The following day, we each received a text to say we'd been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. Given we live in the same house ...<br> :date: __2021-01-20 18:16:11__

> Nice if there was a log of when it was working and when instead of praying that a notification comes up if you've been exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:32:20__

> Update: appear to be getting daily exposure updates now. Will give the app another try. I have had zero response from the developer.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:16:58__

> The app used to work fine until the 10 Dec update but then stopped checking for exposures automatically. It was difficult to report the issue --- it feels like mails / app reviews only got attention after people made fuss on social media. The app works OK now, after the 5 Jan update, but I wish there was an easier way to report bugs, and more transparency regarding existing ones.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 13:18:19__

> Just got a notification after accidently turning off my.location to be informed I haven't been checked since 14th December !!!<br> :date: __2021-01-07 23:23:07__

> Was working for a while but not performed a check since 16th December 2020 despite always being on.<br> :date: __2021-01-03 22:07:19__

> I occasionally check this app and all is well. Thank God.<br> :date: __2020-12-30 23:14:17__

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of Jersey |
| **Website**  | [http://covidalert.gov.je](http://covidalert.gov.je) |
| **Email** | covidalert@gov.je |
| **Physical address**  | [Digital Health, 4 Edward Place, The Parade, St. Helier, Jersey JE2 3QP](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Digital%20Health,%204%20Edward%20Place,%20The%20Parade,%20St.%20Helier,%20Jersey%20JE2%203QP) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Personally I think the Channel Islands as a whole should use a combined system instead of separatist nature. I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature.

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Just discovered the app had been "Auto Disabled" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).<br> :date: __2020-10-21 23:33:44__

> Please add the capacity to scan QR codes like the NHS app does, not having this function leads to confusion in dealing with GB businesses in NI<br> :date: __2020-10-10 08:57:01__

> It seems to work, and I really hope it does.. it is simple, and not intrusive. I look forward to seeing his it pans out.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 01:00:45__

> This app only checks exposure if it comes within a short distance of someone else who has the app. No exposure checks mean you havent been close enough to someone for it to check.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:06:28__

> QUERY! If having to move devices, how are you supposed to transfer the existing exposure checks from the previous 14 days to the new device, in case any of those report a positive case?<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:39:02__

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

> I downloaded the app. I get that someone will notify me if I come into contact with someone who has the app and then tests positive. However, I feel it should give people either daily or weekly updates of places that the person has been and I wonder when two mobile phones that have the app downloaded on the phones - do they react to each other. Another thing is people on the island of ireland both north and south of the island should be able to use both apps together.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 23:59:37__

> I don't see the point in this app. As I checked today 2nd November as I'd accidentally knocked off Bluetooth. Seen it last checked on 12th October.

I did recieve an alert to isolate for 14 days which I did, yet on the 5th day into isolation I got another notification saying that I've been exposed and have to isolate for 14 days.

> I have just deleted the app, the police in England are being given new powers to access your information via the app. Its only a matter of time before NI does the same. This is NOT what I signed up for. Completely lost my trust and have uninstalled. The notifications aren't useful, it doesn't tell you when or where you came into contact with someone.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 10:25:47__

I also have family who were in the same place for the same amount of time with the same people and some got the notification and others didnt. It simply doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 12:42:55__

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> Good<br> :date: __2020-08-08 14:37:46__

> You have to make sure your phone is up to date with system update. I up dated my S10+ and download this and it works fine.<br> :date: __2020-08-04 22:11:47__

> Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:12__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

> This App is not designed for th UK, it is designed only for Gibraltar the app is useless, contact the developer like i did, UK citizen you will be told we can't use it in the UK 🇬🇧 This is their response "This App has been developed specifically with Gibraltar in mind. It is open for download by anyone, including cross-frontier workers and persons who regularly visit Gibraltar. If you are not in Gibraltar (whether residing, working or visiting) this app is of no real use to you"<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:25:30__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Get, 'Something went wrong, please try again later' each time I try to complete medical questionnaire. UPDATE: Now working ok since update. Daily reminder to enter your health status is good. App lacks ability to state that you know you have had Covid, but haven't had a test. This must apply to tens of thousands who suffered at home or who's symptoms were very mild and where caught off other tested members of same household. If to provide valuable data, surly, this must be included.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 13:25:45__

> Was a bit confusing as I only down loaded app after my 1st vaccine,it would not let me go back to add that I also had a head ache and fuzzy head 20hours in so if others had the same experience your symtoms value may be incorrect or wrong<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:47:59__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 14:25:03__

> Only problem I don't know my blood group so I had to guess. There should be an option under blood group to say don't know<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:32:39__

> Please fix the error with the days. I report every day and am frustrated that it continually tells me I haven't reported for 2 or more days. I've tried contacting you various ways, but nothing has changed except it can read up to 5 days now. Am I wasting my time?<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:07:29__

> I failed first of all to enter my vaccination details because I was using as an early version of the app. It was only when I deleted the app in frustration that I realized that if I reinstalled it I might get a newer version. I did email Zoe for help but the instructions were confusing<br> :date: __2021-02-05 20:39:41__

> I am able to report me and my family's condition regularly. However, the app crashes everytime I select the COVID & Diet "Let's go" button. It also crashes before I can send feedback.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 04:46:23__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing. Have you even seen this? Why don't you respond to my numerous contacts about this? I entered yesterday. The app says 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:17:00__

> The app has begun erroring since yesterday (28th Jan 2021). It loads, the screen with 'report today, even if you're well' appears for a split second before the whole screen goes white and stays that way. It's now unusable and this is day two of not being able to log.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 11:47:20__

> Unfortunately when I tried to insert a password my phone's keyboard covered the box I was meant to write it in! An elementary design error which rendered the app useless. I'm surprised this hasn't been fixed.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 17:23:40__

> I installed it 3 weeks ago, and to begin with it worked fine. Then it asked me to log in with my password and email for the first time. I was unable to do that because on my phone - a Samsung Galaxy A10 - as soon as I begin to type, the keyboard covers the place where the password has to go! It was also telling me my password wasn't recognised although I am certain it was the one I submitted. I tried the Force Stop recommended but it made no difference. finally I uninstalled the app. I have tried now to reinstall it but I guess I will still have the same problem. I'd be really grateful if anyone can help. It 's a great idea, but the app needs to be reliable. I am disappointed not to be able to participate.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 22:54:01__

> The app is making a massive contribution to the fight against Covid-19, and on a day-to-day basis it works fine. The downside is that it breaks when it's updated. After the last three updates I've either been unable to login (despite getting a password reset), or the daily notifications have stopped. In all cases the only fix was to uninstall the updated app and reinstall from scratch. The update process needs more testing before new versions are released otherwise users will give up.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 15:06:18__

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

> Covid test question needs an 'unknown' option. I've been tested before, with negative result, but months ago, so saying my 'current status' is negative is misleading, but I can't say I've 'Never' been tested. Could also be used by those who've had a test, but awaiting results. There should be a definition of what 'current' means too. The question on whether you think you've had Covid needs a 'Maybe' option. I think I may have, but mildly & not the obvious symptoms so not confident to say 'Yes'.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:47:12__

> So, well, this app only gets your data: you send your talk, your cough, your data, and that's it. It gives you back nothing. You contribute to science. The problem here is: why don't they give me back the result of my data, based on the data they accumulated? This is not fair, no matter how much the data is valuable/correct. Just give me the output, even if just for curiosity. You state that the app is 98% correct. So there's no reason to be so shy. Also: this app would render the swab completely useless. Maybe the app doesn't give back the results so to not destroy the market of a perfectly useless device like the swab? I can see no other reason.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:10:40__

> The app asked me to complete the same survey every morning. I would have been happy to provide weekly responses, but found daily prompts too stressful given my very limited understanding of how this might help.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 18:27:29__

### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Seems Ok Seting up your NHS access on a laptop or tsblet to avoid fiddling atound with a phone. Some typical design problems. The back button on the phone should have the same function as the back button on the page as you could easily log out. The scroll nars are too thin, particlarily on the desktop version. Date of birth doesnt tab from box to box. Doese anybody who designs these things ever use them!<br> :date: __2021-02-12 13:16:29__

> Works for me now.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 19:51:43__

> Seems yo work well<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:00:02__

> Tried to update the app and it won't work. Uninstalled the original to start again and that won't load. Is there a problem I a ready had the app on my phone and have been using it satisfactorily for months. It was only when I was asked to update it and it wouldn't let me use it until I did, that I had problems with it. My phone is up to date and has plenty of storage and memory. It is the app which has the problem. It was fine until the update.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 02:53:10__

> Not the best app I've ever attempted to use, insists on telling me there's a problem with my connection, strangely everything else on my phone works! Of course UK gov can't be their fault now can it. Could be a very good app with a bit of knowledgeable input<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:18:03__

> The log in took over four hours to complete. It will not load on my laptop. Once everything is up loaded on to a smart phone. you log in to check perscriptions all you get is an error message. I still do not know if they have been ordered and they have just ran out, so now still have to ring to find out. the phone charges are now over forty pounds. A complete waste of time and money !!!!!!!! I now have no error messages so all is working at the moment, fingers crossed up the star rating .<br> :date: __2021-02-03 16:12:08__

> The app has been freezing for last few days. I have sent a report but its still doing it<br> :date: __2021-02-02 18:35:20__

> I have asked for the confirmation email to start but had no email sent to me, must of tried 30 times now<br> :date: __2021-02-01 15:42:12__

> Great app very useful just wish I could make an appointment on this app here<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:59:16__

> Tried to use this to connect without having to go via the surgery but it just says "Sorry - we cannot connect you to your GP surgery" and prompts me to sign up to online services via the surgery (who, when I called them, could not find the information required by the app) This error occured even though I got the verification email saying the surgery has approved it. Currently awaiting a response to the query I raised via link provided.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:42:09__

> Internet connection error! I have been through all of the validation process and had a message of confirmation from my surgery, but every time I try to use the app I get a message saying Internet connection error. There is no issue with my Internet but I cannot use the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 18:48:49__

> Takes to long to fill out<br> :date: __2021-02-08 13:02:28__

> Not very user friendly. History deleted without any notice.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 01:40:38__

> App is great concept...but varification to set it up is a nightmare! Confirming your ID is a problem at the point when you have to do a video and talk 4 secure numbers given to you. The start video now does not find video function and you have no search options as it retainsand goes auto to the galley from when you took a photo of your chosen ID to send.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 15:12:32__

> Disappointed, took a couple of attempts to originally set up, also it the issue of out of date medical records, last entry was for a vaccination in 2013, no mention of the bowel cancer I was diagnosed and treated for in 2019.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 11:14:26__

> It keeps wanting updates it seems...each time I come to use it...a bit of a bore<br> :date: __2021-02-04 10:29:07__

> The prove ID is a nightmare to get through, once through ordering prescriptions seems to work but that's about it. Looking up GP surgery records doesn't work, can't access them. Booking appointment isn't available,<br> :date: __2021-02-13 11:26:00__

> Useless, damn thing won't accept my records.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 22:06:11__

> It could be a very useful app, if only worked! Have tried for months and months to verify my identify. When you need to proceed with uploading your ID or recording the video, it doesn't allow you to select the camera. I have sent several feedbacks and nothing has changed. Have read the troubleshooting guide when there is nothing to troubleshoot as it's clearly a bug. I give up!!!<br> :date: __2021-02-12 21:39:27__

> Video upload not working<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:23:15__

> Impossible to verify your I. D! Absolute waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 15:16:49__

> Rubbish. Awful sign up process, finicky, inefficient, time wasting. Just like the NHS.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 12:25:46__

> I installed the app alongside the coronovirus contact tracing app. My coronavirus jab invitation arrived by post and when my local hospital offered me a jab from unused daily stock, they called my landline. What is the point of this app?<br> :date: __2021-02-12 00:42:41__

> Totally useless for me, I followed the instructions and verified my ID no problem, I cannot however get past the screen that connects to my surgery as they want me to 'present myself at the surgery with 2 forms of ID' - really? in the situation we are in now? - So a complete waste of my time, when all I intended to do was ease the pressure on the NHS. I will probably do what I have always done when it comes to accessing NHS services - give up. I am after all 68 and still soldiering on.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 21:49:26__

> Wasted too much time on this, Cannot confirm my ID to get full functionality as the video option won't open when required , all the permissions are set correctly. Unusable app, Pointless, only one thing worse than a bad app, a bad app that doesn't work. Should be zero stars and would be if it were an option...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:57:18__

> 11/2/2021 Absolute rubbish! This app does NOT work. Aged in my 70's and with the assistance of my son, I spent 2 and a half hours and failed miserably to successfully confirm I.D using the scan function or video function. After having issues with my normal pharmacy access, I expected the NHS app to end my problems. This app has wasted my time and caused great upset. I won't be recommending this app.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 17:31:15__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app has got me off the couch and running. I can't fault the concept and I love Sarah Millican in a new way. Unfortunately I had to knock a star off due to a technical fault. Often - nearly every other time I run - the app switches off mid-training,leaving me either running or walking for an extended period without knowing it's happened, and then wasting time trying to restart the app and remember where I was.

> Somehow, I managed to have 4 copies going at the same time, out of sync. There was no way to stop them. It shouldn't be possible to start it while a copy is running.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:00:41__

> They need to bring it to wearables/iwatch<br> :date: __2021-02-11 10:48:34__

> This app is amazing. After 9 intense weeks I am able to run more than 5k. This app is magical. The reason why I'm rating it 3 stars is sometimes the app becomes buggy during some runs like the music won't fade why your coach speaks to you.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:47:20__

> The app is great and really helps teaching you to run. I am not at 5 k yet but I can run for 30 minutes. The only reason I rated 3 is that it bugged quite a bit on week 5 and started taking me through the week 4 routine again. I was also disappointed that the voice over did not change run to run or at least for the last run of the week.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 11:05:09__

> It would get a 5, but it keeps keeps dropping out if the phone locks or take a photo.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 09:35:37__

> Content is great, I've just completed my second week and I am progressing. However, app not always reliable. Sometimes complains it cant load audio files and has frozen at times. 5 stars for content, 2 for reliability.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 18:53:22__

> Keeps crashing but great idea Started ok but since around 15/1/21 the app shuts down sometime in the first 15 minutes. Can leave you warming up for too long or continuing the first run for too long. Only when you notice and restart the app do you find out you're back at the beginning again. Great idea, love Sarah's voice but not much use unless this can be fixed.Now on week 4 and it's do e in twice on two runs. Please fix it. OnePlus6, all up to date<br> :date: __2021-01-30 15:52:19__

> When the App is working it is fantastic. I've managed to get to wk 3. However keeps crashing and not logging the run.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 00:22:08__

> Stopping talking to me halfway through !!<br> :date: __2021-01-28 21:32:47__

> Excellent, basic, but with annoying flaws. I recommend this, but it is so annoying when the app tells you a run is complete, but all record of it is then lost as you haven't manually saved it. Then having reminder alarms to run going off while you're running is just silly. Five starts with a bit more thought in usability.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 08:02:44__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> It's a great concept and I enjoy using it for the most part but I am sick and tired of the app crashing mid run. Edit - 8/2/21 still crashes mid run. Absolutely useless!<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:00:46__

> Got the app last weekend been out on 2 runs inbetween gym sessions and on both runs the app has just stopped!<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:28:50__

> The running schedule is great and I'm really enjoying it. Michael Johnson's audio is motivational without being cheesey. I have an Honor phone so the app shuts down part way through a run, apparently there's nothing the developers can do about this. I have downloaded a free interval timer that does the job and runs successfully in the background without issue, and just use the Couch to 5k app for the schedule and to log my runs.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 17:33:40__

> The app is fine but doesn't seem to to work with Surface earbuds. The audio sends to pause when connected to wireless earbuds<br> :date: __2021-02-07 14:15:46__

> The principle is good but I'm now at the end of week 5 and giving up on this app. The app has crashed on me the past 5 or 6 times I've been out for a run which becomes frustrating as you lose your position in your session. It has worked to get me off the couch and I am covering 5k but not running the full 5k yet. The bugs need to be addressed as this is a great app when it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 14:09:09__

> The structure is good for first time runners but the app closes constantly losing the place you're at during your run.. Really not useful for actually tracking progress<br> :date: __2021-02-03 14:29:24__

> The app closes itself after a short time, so I can't listen to music while using it, I have to keep my phone open and move the timer to where I think it last stopped. Very annoying. It loses my day every time, putting me back to day one.<br> :date: __2021-01-29 08:26:42__

> Great plan but shocking how much it crashes in the middle of runs. Will delete and try and find a better app that actually works.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 16:04:25__

> Boring<br> :date: __2021-02-10 11:35:11__

> Horrendous app. Completed first run and the app shut itself off 4 times so had to keep restarting, thought it may have just been a glich so stuck with it for the next two runs, done exactly the same thing!! So off putting, concept is good, shame the app doesn't actually follow suit<br> :date: __2021-02-04 16:37:40__

> Rubbish, finished the run and there is no way to view stats, distance, speed etc. It says couch to 5k but there's no way to check. Of course you could run another app alongside it but after music and this that would be 3 apps running simultaneously, the start running app is well better...sorry Jo<br> :date: __2021-02-01 20:50:55__

> Frustrating - the app is not saving my runs and not letting me progress to later week runs. I only want this app to do one thing and that is play a series of podcasts and it doesn't do that.<br> :date: __2021-01-30 12:44:37__

> Keeps cutting out half way through . Deleted it and download again but still does the same<br> :date: __2021-01-29 19:18:10__

> Plan is good, but app keeps disconnecting<br> :date: __2021-01-29 16:02:47__

> It's changed. I used it last year and it was brilliant but now it stops during the warm up walk and I end up walking for longer before I realise. Then I have to restart the app, find my place and start again, only for it to repeat. I would love to keep using it as I found it to be really beneficial for me.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 20:07:49__

### Description
> The Ministry of AYUSH presents the “Ayush Sanjivani” mobile application for understanding the measures adopted by public for enhancing immunity and keeping themselves healthy in the difficult COVID-19 situation. The app is designed as a simple but effective mechanism of electronic documentation for studying population behaviour. Response of the public to the advisories issued by the AYUSH Ministry on immunity enhancement will be an important area of examination. In addition, provision is also made for recording other measures (if any) propagated by AYUSH practitioners and adopted by general public for immunity enhancement and disease prevention. Data collected through this app will be analyzed to find out usage of AYUSH interventions and its efficacy in maintaining health by enhancing immunity.
<br>This app is at the centre of a massive exercise to study specific health seeking behaviours of the public in which the Central Research Councils of AYUSH, the National Institutes of AYUSH, numerous AYUSH educational institutions and state governments bodies collaborate. The Ministry has a target sample size of 1 million people for this study, making it one of the largest in any discipline of medicine. All those who volunteer to furnish information through this app will be making a significant contribution to the study of public health in the country.
<br>Data collected will be analyzed and will be useful for the AYUSH systems, and will establish their viability as health-assuring practices globally. This would also add momentum to the growth of the AYUSH Sector.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Ministry of AYUSH |
| **Website**  | [https://www.ayush.gov.in/](https://www.ayush.gov.in/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.

I do not use the website anymore as you can even buy the stamps there...but do not know how it will be in final (I suppose you receive a Pdf On email to print and glue on the parcel/letter).

> No matter how many updates this app has, it still doesn't work, crashes upon opening everytime. I have been unable to use the app since February 2020 on a Sony Xperia XA1. Sort it out Royal Mail. Update, 13 Feb 2021 decided to try this app again and installed it again, it now works, opens, can login, and view my saved tracking numbers. Let's see how long it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 20:14:54__

> Claims tubes that meet medium parcel dimensions are too big.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 22:00:00__

> Everytime I go on the app my session has expired and have to log in quite frustrating<br> :date: __2021-02-08 08:48:09__

> I use primarily for tracking incoming and outgoing parcels. Cannot edit description when inputting data which leaves me with columns of meaningless numbers until I am eventually allowed to manually edit once RM have clocked the item in system which is very slow and tedious. Unedited numbers are also duplicated in list and shuffled around making even more work! And whatever happened to push notifications? More and more I am having to use third party apps to help with tracking and sanity. 🚛🆘☯️<br> :date: __2021-02-07 15:31:01__

> When you click on a URL to the tracking number on another app suck as a email, it directs to this app instead of a web page which would be great but it doesn't phase the URL and extract the tracking number then take you directly there.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 09:34:29__

> Tracking Don't Update most of the time<br> :date: __2021-01-21 16:07:13__

> Useless they delivered to my house every day but don't have my address in the app therefore cant even log on or do anything<br> :date: __2021-01-26 21:24:17__

> Difficult to track things<br> :date: __2021-01-25 16:16:27__

> Needs quite a bit of work to make it worth having on the phone. It tells you you've had an attempted delivery, but with the same notification you cannot book a redelivery. Makes no sense.<br> :date: __2021-01-24 11:49:15__

> Gives you no option to talk to a real person in a live chat when you want to find out what's happened to your package you go round and round in circles with the options they give you and end up no better off you would of thought a company as big as royal mail would have that option and more tracking info so far not impressed at all<br> :date: __2021-01-20 19:59:54__

> App can be good but is limited and annoying. If registered and track items if you are out on delivery it doesn't let you schedule redelivery using details on app.You have to manually enter everything including address to redeliver.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 17:19:05__

> No landscape support<br> :date: __2021-01-19 08:30:47__

> Rocky start. Firstly they don't tell you if your previous login from the old app has been carried over so I had to do a forgot password to see if my email is still recognised. Then I wanted to change my password. To do this in a standard way on any app you tapo the three lines to pull down the menu - so far so good, then you tap Account - oh no you don't there isn't one so you fumble about trying the obscure options and get know where. I still haven't found where the Account settings are.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 12:22:55__

> There is no way to change your password in the app or website settings, seriously?<br> :date: __2021-01-07 15:06:41__

> Great App and Worse Service in UK. Maybe behind DPD. Hermes is better.<br> :date: __2021-02-13 13:26:55__

> The app is great, at giving misinformation, and delivering outlandishly overpromised delivery dates. The actual delivery service is an outdated dinosaur, needs to be wound up. 48 hour deliveries take up to a week, or 3 weeks, or get lost and never turn up. Update: latest package sat in a distribution centre for a week then got returned to the retailer, app still shows it in the distribution centre<br> :date: __2021-02-12 11:22:17__

> Third try with this app, previous review below. Your request could not be processed due to temporarily server maintenance. Does this app ever work? Previous review: Failed to help on a parcel a coupe of months back, but I thought I'd risk it and try again. No point - this time 'internal server error message'. Fails on the first task of redelivery! Downloaded this to try and get a parcel redelivered and got the same 'sorry an error occured while processing your request' others have.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 00:32:20__

> Awful<br> :date: __2021-02-10 16:15:15__

> Need to make the app like DPD and Hermes. Whereby it knows your details and notifys you when you have received a parcel and keeps you up to date when it's arriving. This app is nothing more than a waste of time.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 11:51:12__

> Royal mail what a joke you are. 1st I have a delivery window attached to my property that allows large parcels to be left in a secure room. So what do I find a Royal mail missed delivery telling me item to big for letter box no large parcel in the delivery window just the card 2nd you get a qr code to arrange a delivery that directs you to a Google app that doesn't work. 3rd you try calling the attached number and wait 2 hours to contact a human with the BS bovine splatter music excuse<br> :date: __2021-02-08 17:54:05__

### Description

It provides ways to pay bills, sign up for recreation activities, call departments with one click, as well as Live Video feeds from many traffic cameras throughout the city.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Since, I have a terrible experience using this App. here are some pointers for all the users, and hope these helps: 1. Make sure to register the same Contact no. you gave during PCR test. Thus, it will show an error credentials. 2. Unfortunately, if you got infected after your quarantine. You are required to complete 2 negative results. Thus, it won't turn to green. IMPORTANT!!! MAKE SURE TO UNDERGO A PCR IN DHA ONLY. NOT TO THE CLINIC.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 06:00:07__

> The app is not working properly, covid 19 test report is not reflecting in my Al Hosn app, I tried to reach customer care to fix the issue more than trice today, they are just telling that it will be fix within 30 minutes each times. I am travelling from Dubai to Abu Dhabi and as per New rule border police will not allow me to enter Abu Dhabi until unless the report reflected in App.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:58:22__

> For anyone suffering from wrong credentials issue, you need to download and install UAE Pass application, and verify the information at an approved kiosk (you can do this at the FCA happiness centers), after that and one PCR test the Al Hosn app will work.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 04:52:16__

> Upon installation, I can't seem to get past the initial introduction pages. The button at the bottom which says "Ask for permissions" does nothing when tapped. I've checked the permissions that the app has been granted in the application manager, and it has everything it needs. Phone is a Samsung J3 running Android 5.1.1. Update: Thanks to the team for updating this so quickly. All working perfectly now!<br> :date: __2021-02-03 10:32:29__

> Never leaves me alone. Works really well. Dare not sign on unless I've got a good bit of time to offer because I can easily get the next call before I've got home from the previous.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 18:54:23__

> Hi my app isn't working, I'm not getting any sound when simulating an alert and only just realised. I could of missed so many calls because of this it's not fair<br> :date: __2021-01-16 03:04:47__

> Edit: Thank you for clarifying and the quick response, that is working now! The app is not sending me notifications, I have been sent tasks but are missing them (even though I have been using my phone at the time the message is sent) because the app isn't sending my phone notifications. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times now and have checked notification and location permissions are allowed...<br> :date: __2021-01-13 21:43:42__

> Excellent link to people who need support. Easy to manage App.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 17:15:05__

> Yay ! Now can change the alert sound, both I, my neighbour and my neighbour's dog are happy :-)<br> :date: __2020-12-21 15:15:22__

> Great App, functions well. Alot of people moaning about the noise but they need to understand it was originally set up to alert responders like myself to a cardiac arrest and that this happens infrequently and needs to be loud and out there to make sure it alerts us! I have responded using it and it was very good and I know of several responders that use it well.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:23:43__

> Helping in times like these is vital. User friendly precise and professional.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 17:43:57__

> Always freeze accept button when I am assigned for task...don't know what's happening...<br> :date: __2020-09-14 15:21:40__

> A service that provides help for people in need. Very professional and friendly service that's was needed during the Covid 19 pandemic but still provides essential services through out the year.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 21:29:15__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> The app works ok most of the time. One problem I get is the location side, I've had to reject quite a few alerts that have been 12 miles away even though my app is set at 5 miles.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:57:46__

> The App need an audible alert when scheduled tasks appear. I have missed opportunities to volunteer due to this. Steve. NHS/RVS Volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 16:16:50__

> The issue I had experienced has been resolved. Now, the app is up and running on my phone as it should. Thank you 👍<br> :date: __2021-01-15 16:06:29__

> I just updated as there should be a new task tab for vaccination steward volunteers. I see nothing different<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:39:42__

> Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a "double ding" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the "accept" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the "bypass silent" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one "ding" now as expected - thnx!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:48:32__

> Update: issue now fixed with a distance slider on the 'me' tab, the app now works fine. ----- I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 18:50:43__

> Early experience so far is fine. Though when I select 'find a route' in simulation mode Uber opens rather than Google maps. Any ideas on how to correct this?<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:02:09__

> Excellent and very easy to use. However there is more way to return to the information page after you have accepted the task.<br> :date: __2021-01-04 18:59:08__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:50:54__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2021-01-29 09:28:59__

> The app tells me my certificate/ID is out of date but when I log onto the website it states it's valid until next year. Please help!<br> :date: __2021-01-29 07:30:57__

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> Can the app not give basic details on the alert as hard to know if can adequately deal with the situation? Also I assume the alert goes to everyone locally until someone responds...I hope so as I didn't get sound on notification so no idea what time it came through?<br> :date: __2021-01-23 14:50:50__

> This app work fine on my phone, but my husband cannot get it to work on his Galaxy Alpha. The screen displays 'please log in' but there is nowhere to do so, and you cannot exit from the app. He really wants to volunteer.<br> :date: __2021-01-21 11:00:36__

> I don't know how to change my settings, as requested, and don't know how you would know my preferred distances (for being a steward at vaccination centres). Incidentally, I'd find it easier if messages referred to miles not kilometres, as that's what we use in this country!<br> :date: __2021-01-15 00:28:17__

> Keeps crashing.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:17:56__

> 1. I uninstalled the Goodsam app from my Android v10 tablet as the Task tab didn't show like on the smartphone. I was planning to reinstall to fix this bug. Now it says my tablet isn't compatible. WHY!!? It seems perverse to withdraw the tablet version. It was useful if my wife borrowed the phone. 2. I am signed up as a stewarding volunteer. It would help if you could add an alert when a task comes in. This could be the siren already in place. But as the "tasks" are less urgent an email would suffice.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 20:16:22__

> 02/02/21 STILL UNABLE to upload photos of new AEDs locations to the GoodSAM app this is after installing the latest version available. When trying to use a photo taken with a google pixel phone with all location accesses switch on, the GoodSAM app still says to use a picture with location services switched on. In the past, I've replied via email to yourselves about this issue, uploaded bug reports sent pictures and still awaiting your reply.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 15:04:48__

> Buggy, clunky UI. Clicking on 'Show details' of a booked task closes the app every time. The details can only be seen by restarting the app. No way to go back to the homepage without clicking back through every page of the 'tasks' section. Can't copy text, eg task addresses.

> The installation is clunky. If there's anything going to stop somewhere using an app, that'll be it. (I test and write software as a profession.) It's hard to scroll the page without hitting a selector (such as the country). The image crop allows only a square and could not set to the width of my driver's license, so part of the license was cut off. After several attemps of that, I was forced to select Work ID instead of Drivers License. And please fully capitalise countries' names!<br> :date: __2021-02-13 00:16:26__

> I spent nearly an hour calling people before someone actually needed assistance. Not very good use of my time. After spending 5 hours on this app, I only physically helped 2 people. The database seem to have far too many people in it who doesn't need immediate assistance and tends to like pushing you more and more inwards towards the city centre rather than in just your local area.

> Over 500 hours of volunteering, not been called on once. Reported the problem, told to uninstall and reinstall. Did that a few times, still not working.

### Description
> Campus is the Airbus app that helps you quickly locate where you are and what is around you whilst visiting an Airbus site. The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks.

### Description
> Active 10 is a free and easy to use walking app that tracks your walking and shows you how you can increase your intensity to benefit your health. The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress
<br>* Store and view up to 12 months of your walking activity, to see how far you have come 
<br>* Discover loads of hints and tips on achieving a healthier lifestyle
<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Public Health England Digital |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> It's motivating, I have only been using the app for just over a week, and I set myself daily challenges to do a bit more than the day before. It's easy to use, and u can see your progress.

> Good for timing your walks<br> :date: __2021-02-10 14:12:34__

> Good and easy to use. Puzzled why it will say I have achieved a target for a whole week when I have had days I haven't been outside!<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:45:33__

> I downloaded this app as although I walked every day I was concerned that it wasn't beneficial to my health . This app tracks brisk walking that is walking that gets your heart beating and burns fat. So far I'm impressed with the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-08 23:14:37__

> Not easy to understand.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 21:00:39__

> I find it helpful when it works but some days it doesn't .<br> :date: __2021-02-08 14:16:50__

> The new version isn't as good as the old one. Not as easy to track down he month's walking. Can we have old one back?<br> :date: __2021-02-07 13:43:58__

> It was working great keep me motivated until it stopped registering any steps that I had done. Also showed steps one day but were not there the next.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 07:12:57__

> It's great for motivating me to just do 20-30 mins brisk walking each day. But the minutes it records changes later in the day - reduces! So it may say I did 33 mins brisk, then suddenly it changes to 28 mins brisk - which is very annoying. If they could iron that issue out it would be great.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 09:15:50__

> Works when it works. When outside walking it picks up the motion. However it doesn't register anything other than time - often erroneously - when eg ballroom dancing or treadmill walking.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 11:54:48__

> I know I have walked brisk sometimes but the app does not alway pick it up<br> :date: __2021-01-29 10:14:37__

> Good idea I guess it got me off the sofa but it doesn't always seems to work, seems to depend on which pocket my phone is in which is slightly demotivating.<br> :date: __2021-01-27 09:12:34__

> Not been using for long. But clear and concise<br> :date: __2021-01-22 13:38:54__

> It's an ok app. As long as you have your phone in your pocket it records the time you are moving and how much of it was brisk. It does seem to lose the information from one day to another though, which is a bit annoying as you could compare your movements over the last week or months - pointless if it doesn't save continuously. The app does have information, or rather links to other areas, ie healthy eating.<br> :date: __2021-01-20 12:57:15__

> Doesn't take into consideration somebody's starting fitness level or age. I went for a walk for 40 minutes in the snow came back sweating and out of breath. My doctor says that is a brisk walk and good for me the app size I did 5-minutes. I feel that you need to be jogging for it to say you're walking briskly. Not all bad it does tell you how long you've been walking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:04:25__

> Very disappointed that the app doesn't always count the brisk steps. If I put my phone in my pocket it counts steps but not brisk steps. I have to hold the phone in my hand for it to work properly. It took me a long while to work this out. It was helpful to read that other people had experienced the same problem and I tried holding it as a result. Nowhere on the app to discuss problems like this. When it does count accurately I find it very useful and motivating.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 13:31:15__

> A 20 minute walk is apparently 40 minutes. Unsure if this actually measures the time of the walk correctly however it definitely encourages you to be more active. I'd give it more if it was more accurate.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 21:27:37__

> Recently has consistently failed to record what I know must be brisk walking given the number of people I overtake, and the distance. Am going to uninstall. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 16:21:50__

> Sometimes works sometimes doesn't.. Bit more than frustrating at times... Still the steps are done which is the point..<br> :date: __2021-02-04 12:38:59__

> Doesn't recognize brisk walking on my HTC desire 530, even if I jog and I've tried it in every pocket.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 19:11:34__

> Although it's an encouraging app, I've noticed it's not completely accurate but helps general motivational. I would be really happy if it actually measured the distances walked or run.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 14:56:11__

> Regularly does not track my brisk walking unless I hold the phone in my hand while I walk.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:53:20__

> I walked, and my walks were measured and I got a badge , great! Then walks disappeared😐uninstalled and re installed.. same thing🤷👎 Good idea, but its not working properly<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:35:42__

> Works fine on IOS but poor on Android - keeps stopping - can't adjust the target. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still same. All my other apps work fine.<br> :date: __2021-01-17 02:54:31__

> For a supposedly motivational app, this one is astonishingly demotivating! Regularly removing "Active" minutes a few hours after awarding them is not good. It has now started not recording anything about 1 day in 3 - just pretends my brisk walking didn't happen!<br> :date: __2021-02-11 12:49:37__

> It hasn't registered my walks for the last few days, definitely walking 'briskly' enough! Disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 13:42:28__

> I have no idea what you have to do to register brisk walking. I was walking at a pace to make me breath hard and built a sweat keeping the pace steady up and down hills. Result 31 minutes 0 brisk. Tried it again. This time despite walking for a couple of hours at the weekend and one again today, the app failed to record that I had walked at all, let alone briskly. It is therefore useless. Time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 12:30:13__

> Very poor app. Have installed and used it twice now. Both times my fitbit tracker recorded over 100 minutes brisk walking. This app recorded 3 minutes the first walk, and 19 the next. I have deleted it and won't bother again.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 12:59:27__

> Hopeless. Now worse. Keeps saying I might lose data as I need to log in every 30 days. I am pleased to see the return of rewards but when are you going to get the basics to work properly? It is showing 42 mins brisk walking today though I've only just got up but nothing at all for yesterday when I went for a long brisk walk and my data for 12 days ago never did appear.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 11:21:17__

> Installed first time and registered brisk walk, next few days nothing. Unistalled the Installed again and still not registering brisk walks or steps. A good idea but not working. Now unable to register as will not accept my Post Code / email address.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:01:21__

> This use to work, it's broken now<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:37:53__

> A good app for raising blood pressure, not so good for encouraging walking. It seems to forget data despite the update. For instance on the day it says 20 minutes, look at your history and it's only 5.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:36:30__

> Loses walking data within 24 hours which is really annoying despite the update on 15th January.<br> :date: __2021-01-19 13:33:18__

> Broken since last update!<br> :date: __2021-01-18 07:40:26__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Innovatise GmbH |
| **Website**  | [http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure](http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure) |
| **Email** | leisuremembership@rctcbc.gov.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> 💚 Order repeat prescriptions to your door
<br>💚 Book GP appointments
<br>💚 View your GP medical record and carry it in your pocket
<br>💚 Discover your Wellness Score and get practical insights into your wellbeing
<br>💚 Build your most accurate health record
<br><b>NHS-ASSURED GP ONLINE SERVICES</b>
<br>Available at all GP practices in England:
<br>• Save yourself time by booking and cancelling GP appointments ⏰
<br>• Order your repeat prescriptions directly to your door, so you’re never without your medication 🚚 💊
<br>• Stay informed with 24/7 access to your GP medical record, including test results, immunisations, allergies and medications 📁
<br><b>ONE HEALTH RECORD. WHEN YOU NEED IT</b> 
<br>It may come as a surprise but a central record of your health doesn’t exist - your GP, hospital and other healthcare records aren’t joined up and information is not necessarily shared between them. That can make things pretty tricky, having to remember important information from memory, and explain past treatments and conditions over and over. With Evergreen Life, you can be in control and keep all your health data, including all of your GP records, in the palm of your hand - building a fully accurate and up-to-date record that you can carry with you all the time.
<br><b>WHAT’S YOUR WELLNESS SCORE?</b>
<br>Your Wellness Score can help you understand if you’re doing all you can to stay well. The score is based on your answers to the app’s clinically-researched Wellness Checks in areas such as fitness, happiness, sleep and diet. By discovering your Wellness Score, you’ll get personalised and practical insights into ways you can optimise your health and wellbeing.
<br><b>MEDICATION REMINDERS</b>
<br>Give yourself one less thing to worry about. Never forget to take your medications again with the Evergreen Life medicine app, helping you safely manage your own or your family’s health 💊
<br><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER</b>
<br>Track your health and fitness measurements, including blood pressure, body fat percentage and blood sugar levels, so you can monitor your health goals 🏋️‍♂️🤸‍♂️
<br><b>SECURELY STORE YOUR DOCUMENTS</b>
<br>If you struggle to find appointment letters or your health information is difficult to manage, storing all your documents in one app can make it much easier to organise your care 📩
<br><b>SHARE WITH THOSE WHO MATTER MOST</b>
<br>Get the best care possible and give peace-of-mind to your family or health providers with secure access to your shared health information.
<br> 
<br><b>DNA TESTING: UNLOCK YOUR HEALTH SECRETS</b> 🤫
<br>With Evergreen Life DNA testing, you can find out how your genes influence your:
<br>• DIET - Fuel your body with the nutrition it needs
<br>• METABOLISM - Understand what foods will help you feel healthiest
<br>• FITNESS - Achieve better fitness results, faster
<br>• SKIN - Personalise your beauty routine by what your skin needs
<br>Need a helping hand? 🖐️ If you want any help and support with using the app or getting set up with GP online services, head to https://help.evergreen-life.co.uk or call our Support Team at 0161 768 6063

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Evergreen Health Solutions Ltd |
| **Website**  | [http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk](http://www.evergreen-life.co.uk) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Now I have no way of saving a PDF copy which was the feature I used the most. It hasn't fixed the size problem, trying to print to PDF gives 13 pages for a few page document, not even changing the paper size to A2 works!

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Ansa Environmental Services Ltd |
| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | emma@dalzell.com |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ansa+Environmental+Services+Ltd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ansa+Environmental+Services+Ltd) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Gingerbread, version 2.3.3 - 2.3.7 (API level 10) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
