The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

### Description

<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Not sure if this app actually does anything. Only seems to do a check when I open it. App can go days with no checking for contacts according to the fingerprint checking Google summary page.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 18:55:23__

> As people from other area's in the UK visit Scotland I don't believe the app syncs with other apps from other locations in the UK but only Scotland. If this is the case then it won't work unless someone in Scotland develops covid and others have this same version.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 14:37:32__

> This might just be the most effective software to be Bluetooth turned on all the time to enable almost everyone in Scotland to track&trace possible SARS/covid carriers,..<br> :date: __2021-04-04 11:33:48__

> Early version seemed fine, sat happily in background, but now app complains when I don't have Bluetooth or location on at home.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 11:07:01__

> Couldn't add my positive code to the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 01:02:01__

> Of questionable usability. Stay at home, and this app will still keep nagging you to switch on location - presumably the vision of the Covid hordes invading your dwelling makes spending battery power on satellite navigation worthwhile. Now, I remember The Omega Man from the first time around (1971 film), but did the designer of this really do so too? 🤔 I'd rather not be nagged at home to turn this on, thanks.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:13:23__

> Newest version no longer available for my phone. This means lower protection as lockdown is ending. very angry at this.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 01:13:48__

> Too slow to react. The app is only as good as the data it has to work with. I got a notification I should isolate for -6 days (yes minus 6 days) it took that long for the data to be made available to the app...<br> :date: __2021-04-13 11:47:25__

> Twice in three days I was contacted to isolate for 10 days despite never being in anyone's company inside or out within two meters I haven't even been near my own family. If passing someone on a pavement within seconds triggers the app for you to isolate then what's the point? They sell coffee at a door where people congregate on a pavement less than two meters to get past?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:03:34__

> Gave me a notification saying I had been in contact with someone with covid and had to self isolate....10 days AFTER I had been in contact with them and I only had to isolate for 1 day?? Not convinced it works or it is very slow to update you.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:05:01__

> When I first got the App I thought it was great to have it but now I am convinced it doesn't work giving people false confidence they've not been in contact with Covid, I have been in close contact with covid infected people yet never had notification. I think its flawed by requiring people to self input if they have it. Yet reading other reviews such as people in same household both entering details and none being informed that they've been in close contact? Raises suspension app authenticity<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:44:35__

> I was quite naive and feeling safe because I hwe receuved zero contact alerts, so was blissfully confident that I was OK. Until today that is, when I discovered that a) there was an update that was not automatically applied, b) there are so many criticisms of the app and c) so many complaint communucations to the developer remain unanswered.... Is the app a complete con? Is it just to calm the naive and stupid like me. I had not encountered any issues, but then I didn't expect to.. I was safe???<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:07:48__

> There is no way of knowing if it iseven working. Updates saying everything is fine you haven't been in contact with a positive person would be nice.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 13:30:55__

> Never had an alert no idea if that's working and there's no way to take two phones and do a diagnostic safe proximity test between them for reassurance. I simply don't trust this or the NHSEngland equivalent and I use both.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 04:20:30__

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

> Personally I think the Channel Islands as a whole should use a combined system instead of separatist nature. I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:29:22__

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

> 👍😎<br> :date: __2020-11-05 21:22:14__

> So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> This app is really easy and fast and doesn't have too much of an impact on your battery life<br> :date: __2020-08-18 01:16:04__

> Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:12__

> No instructions on how it works<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:03:07__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm close to giving up on this app. My second jab was done as part of a trial. The app does not want trial jabs to be recorded. So I have to lie every day and say I haven't had a second jab. I also had hay fever recently and was asked to take a Covid test. Hay fever is completely normal for me at this time of year. I will probably have it for a couple of months.

> Apparently I'm supposed to be able to log my vaccine on here. Still have not worked out how. Can ask other people log their vaccine, but no idea how to log my own. Very frustrating. I've checked I've got the latest version, I'm pretty tech savvy but still no idea. Given up.<br> :date: __2021-04-06 08:49:24__

Ditto for the UK map: that's become invisible too. I contacted Zoe a good while back, they acknowledged the problem...but nothing.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

> Covid test question needs an 'unknown' option. I've been tested before, with negative result, but months ago, so saying my 'current status' is negative is misleading, but I can't say I've 'Never' been tested. Could also be used by those who've had a test, but awaiting results. There should be a definition of what 'current' means too. The question on whether you think you've had Covid needs a 'Maybe' option. I think I may have, but mildly & not the obvious symptoms so not confident to say 'Yes'.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:47:12__

> So, well, this app only gets your data: you send your talk, your cough, your data, and that's it. It gives you back nothing. You contribute to science. The problem here is: why don't they give me back the result of my data, based on the data they accumulated? This is not fair, no matter how much the data is valuable/correct. Just give me the output, even if just for curiosity. You state that the app is 98% correct. So there's no reason to be so shy. Also: this app would render the swab completely useless. Maybe the app doesn't give back the results so to not destroy the market of a perfectly useless device like the swab? I can see no other reason.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:10:40__

> The app asked me to complete the same survey every morning. I would have been happy to provide weekly responses, but found daily prompts too stressful given my very limited understanding of how this might help.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 18:27:29__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> NHS app finally updated the over envasive security requirements to request the already existing patient data from your GP. A great improvement. The login process needs massive improvement, fingerprint doesn't work or prompt. Will review the app shortly, thx<br> :date: __2021-05-22 09:53:13__

> Impressive features, I look forward to making use of them to reduce the time I spend trying to get through to my GP's surgery. My biggest gripe is that the app breaks the Android back button. It doesn't take you BACK to the previous page, it tries to log you out of the app every time press use it. To get back, you need to tap a link on the page, also marked "Back". Otherwise I would have given the app 5 stars. It was ironic to have to submit my passport and a video of myself given that anyone who knows my name, date of birth and address can access / alter this information over the phone with my GP's surgery. I suspect that this is more of a problem with my GP's surgery than this app though. I'm also surprised that it's acceptable to restrict full access to the app to people who have paid to have a form of photo ID given the claims made about measures to combat election fraud recently.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 17:35:03__

> Why does my covid passport have an expiration date? (20/06/21)<br> :date: __2021-05-21 12:15:17__

> Could someone please tell me how to register a second person . We both use same email . There doesn't seem to be any way to set up new registration using same email .<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:39:29__

> Working fine now, registered with local GP online and my records show in the app.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:35:06__

> I have registered ok and I can log in but it didn't ask me to submit a ID photo or my picture? How do I do this?<br> :date: __2021-05-20 23:05:37__

> I found it easy to install and register, except for the taking a photo. The app decided when to take the photo instead of the user, I think it should be the other way round as I had glasses on still reading instructions, whereas the comparisons picture for validation was my driving licence which does not have me wearing glasses. I think it is a good thing that the NHS shares the data it has with the patient. The only problem I had was trying to check the QR code. Is there a special app to read it or anything you can recommend, because when I tried a QR reader or Scanner against it I just got "gobblygook" text, so I have no idea if the QR code actually works, It would be good to check that it did, before I used it in earnest. Thanks<br> :date: __2021-05-20 22:58:40__

> Was a bit annoyed at first as it wants an email address to confirm identity - and the mail didnt arrive. Turned out it was somehow being regarxed as spam....duh Followed the reg process - youll need your nhs number - and it was then fine.and in then shows my covid vaccination status, which is actually quite cool<br> :date: __2021-05-20 19:30:28__

> It's good but should have section to virtually hold the GHIC travel health card. It should also hold Covid 19 vaccination status, test status, that can be used in conjunction with airlines and other countries proof of vaccination. The app should also generate a QR code for vaccine status that is compatible with the EU Digital Green Certificate.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 17:56:16__

> It works well.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 17:41:25__

> I installed the app in my mobile and it worked perfectly. But, when I installed the app in my wife's mobile, it demanded to do a prove who am I, I did the photo of the driving licence and record a small video with numbers , which it didn't go. That's completely stupid and no need to do it . I gave all the details of my wife and nhs number, so no need to make it complicated. My app in my mobile didn't ask me for the prove who am I. It access easily to my health records.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 09:37:29__

> Hardly works properly always kicking out errors when trying to access it, fingerprint keeps switching itself off. One of the most useless apps I have ever used. I was in A&E at the beginning of the week and it didn't even register. Someone seriously needs to get a grip of this app.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 08:07:26__

> Oh dear. For a health app, the devs don't seem to have heard of accessibility. The icons at the bottom of the screen are poor anyway so need text. I needed a magnifier to read that text! And then there's the inconsistent way of going "back". Sometimes there is a Back link on-screen, sometimes not. The only thing which seems consistent is that the Android back button doesn't do what you'd want to do. The app seems to be a poor quality copy of an iOS app rather than being fit for purpose on Androi<br> :date: __2021-05-20 19:33:50__

> Unable to verify identity. Have made two or three attempts to verify my identity, so can't even use the app, which as it is rhe official app for proving one has had the jabs is fairly unhelpful. I uploaded a photo successfully, then tried facial scan but then just got "please wait" for ages before the app chucked me off. Further attempts won't give me facial scan option, only video option and then that comes up as "file not recognised". A NOT splendid way to waste several hours!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 08:10:02__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

> Minor issues with automatic music control (often changing the volume too late or for too long) otherwise great way to get into (or back into) running.<br> :date: __2021-05-22 14:24:01__

> Great app. Very motivational. Only improvement I would suggest, I would love to see it have trackers/music attached to it. Ideally you need 3 apps open at the same time, numerous occasions you get so caught up with one, you lose the others.. nothing more frustrating than completing the run and it not saving on the tracker!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 09:55:15__

> Loving the app so far, but am finding it's not logging all of my runs- so having to repeat Run 1 of Week 2 again- hoping it's a one-off but mildly frustrating having to go back again!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 03:48:32__

> When it works it's great but it's much too easy to pause or exit it mid run which is very annoying.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 23:37:48__

> Like the reminder feature, and Michael Johnson is great!<br> :date: __2021-05-20 13:21:55__

> So good to have a familiar voice supporting on this journey<br> :date: __2021-05-19 00:10:57__

> So easy to follow and succeed!<br> :date: __2021-05-16 22:09:55__

> Easy to use, with our without glasses.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 08:33:11__

> Great app and really helps build stamina pretty quickly. Would be 5 stars except that it crashes mid session at least once per session (usually during the warm up or 1st run)<br> :date: __2021-05-14 14:17:50__

> It's good but seems to have a flaw where it doesn't count all my runs. So I have to do 4 runs each "week" {this actually makes it more than a week) for it to count 3! I'm on week 4 now and this has happened in weeks 2,3 and 4. I don't think it happened in week 1. But no-one else in the reviews has complained about this so maybe use just me! I guess it won't hurt I'll just complete the program more gradually than everyone else.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 12:09:53__

> Works perfectly on an iPhone, pretty terrible on a Samsung galaxy.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 03:34:32__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> Love Jo Whiley coaching, she is so motivational, but the app turns itself off towards the end of most runs! Screen is locked and it is nothing to do with battery saver<br> :date: __2021-04-26 21:44:36__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs<br> :date: __2021-04-18 00:28:38__

> So downloaded this app and used it with music on my old phone. Used Jo as my coach as she sounds sincere. New phone now cant listen to Jo & music- it says "can't use music with this trainer". Use Laura, got my music but no marker for half way through to turn around- guessing. Why is it so random and variable???<br> :date: __2021-04-17 20:14:29__

> Great Idea! Very basic, app need work. Issues include: Volume of narrator is very low compared to other apps at the same phone volume level so I can't play music while trying to listen to instructions. Silent running for me. Not intuitive and I consistant, on the last day week two second to last run is the only time Sanjeev does not tell me to start running. Pointless celebrity Voices, they all say the exact same thing... What's the point? I genuinely thought they had recorded it for someone.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 08:23:54__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

> Unfortunately even after changing settings on my phone, the app would just stop whilst on my run. Sometimes twice. I now have to listen to the poscasts.<br> :date: __2021-04-10 21:11:12__

### Description
> The Ministry of AYUSH presents the “Ayush Sanjivani” mobile application for understanding the measures adopted by public for enhancing immunity and keeping themselves healthy in the difficult COVID-19 situation. The app is designed as a simple but effective mechanism of electronic documentation for studying population behaviour. Response of the public to the advisories issued by the AYUSH Ministry on immunity enhancement will be an important area of examination. In addition, provision is also made for recording other measures (if any) propagated by AYUSH practitioners and adopted by general public for immunity enhancement and disease prevention. Data collected through this app will be analyzed to find out usage of AYUSH interventions and its efficacy in maintaining health by enhancing immunity.
<br>This app is at the centre of a massive exercise to study specific health seeking behaviours of the public in which the Central Research Councils of AYUSH, the National Institutes of AYUSH, numerous AYUSH educational institutions and state governments bodies collaborate. The Ministry has a target sample size of 1 million people for this study, making it one of the largest in any discipline of medicine. All those who volunteer to furnish information through this app will be making a significant contribution to the study of public health in the country.
<br>Data collected will be analyzed and will be useful for the AYUSH systems, and will establish their viability as health-assuring practices globally. This would also add momentum to the growth of the AYUSH Sector.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.

> Great service, excellent staff. well done royal mail ❤️<br> :date: __2021-05-21 14:28:48__

> Royal mail have been the main UK postal service since Time began! and have always been reliable! l don't think they have the public faith that they used to have Year's ago! but they've coped admirably during this Pandemic and most likely clawed back some of that missing public faith! Well done Royal Mail!<br> :date: __2021-05-21 01:17:02__

> Overall it does what you'd expect. it goyld ne improved by autoupdating when someone semds you packaged as other such apps do<br> :date: __2021-05-18 18:42:57__

> I've used this app twice, and it is good.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 11:57:46__

> Great, a few of the features could be improved upon. There is an awful lot of information which is really helpful. This means I can find out how much a parcel is to send or track my own, without having to call RM, who are always busy. I like how I can link texts & emails from either Royal Mail or, indeed, the companies I am buying from, straight to the app, it cam all be looked at & tracked with my phone. very useful app & service. I would recommend. I want to add my thanks for their service<br> :date: __2021-05-14 20:39:41__

> Useful app but it needs the ability to clearly define a safe delivery location, extra star when this feature is provided in the app<br> :date: __2021-05-22 10:54:22__

> parcels being delivered to me are not automatically visible on app unless it's tracking number is physicaly typed in other companies do this automatically<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:04:01__

> good app gives bit more clarity but could maybe do more to track a parcel<br> :date: __2021-05-21 02:51:21__

> As with most delivery apps it this relies on accurate info input. Parcels showing as 'Due for delivery on....' and then not updating even when the due date passes make these apps incredibly frustrating. This is no exception.<br> :date: __2021-05-20 03:42:07__

> It would be nice to be updated on tracked parcels. Sometimes you get updates others you cant track until its delivered.<br> :date: __2021-05-19 13:51:05__

> slow and unreliable<br> :date: __2021-05-17 17:12:41__

> Confusing as items are lodged with Post Office, to be delivered by Royal Mail. Therefore the number issued by Post Office, for tracking may not work in Royal Mail App.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 15:26:25__

> Takes a wee while to get into it, but it works.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 08:17:17__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Can we have a filter option by day of the week or time under future tasks, please? Sometimes with more than several hundreds on that list it is very difficult to find the relevant ones for VSS roles. Many thanks.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:00:55__

> Works for me. However, it would be nice to be able to list future tasks differently or offer sort by options.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 17:42:33__

> I've registered to volunteer at vaccination sites, received an email saying that they have noticed I hadn't taken up any opportunity, well that's because I haven't received any! Still receiving check in and chat and community response but nothing else.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 19:54:30__

> Please allow filtering of future tasks by day<br> :date: __2021-05-04 11:55:54__

> Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 06:05:24__

> Since the update, this is a good app. I still haven't had a volunteering alert for the vaccination centres yet, here's hoping!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:01:46__

> Seems to run well. Had no alerts yet since registering<br> :date: __2021-02-26 05:17:37__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> The app works ok most of the time. One problem I get is the location side, I've had to reject quite a few alerts that have been 12 miles away even though my app is set at 5 miles.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:57:46__

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> Can the app not give basic details on the alert as hard to know if can adequately deal with the situation?

### Description
> Campus is the Airbus app that helps you quickly locate where you are and what is around you whilst visiting an Airbus site. The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Learning more about my eating habits. Quite an eye opening.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 14:03:13__

> I wanted to find an easy way to increase my activity and found this NHS sponsored app. It has really encouraged me to get out every day for at least 20 mins walk and after less than a month I am feeling the benefits.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 08:55:22__

> I loved this app at first it's very useful as I have fibromyalgia an need to phase my exercise slowly. However the app stopped registering my brisk steps and i kept pushing harder to get those brisk mins in, the result was I pushed to hard, then it stopped working. At times I walk quickly and it doesn't register other times I walk slowly and it registers. This has been demotivating. If these issue were fixed it would be a great tool for me<br> :date: __2021-05-09 13:52:48__

> The app is great 👍<br> :date: __2021-05-09 09:25:08__

> Good incentive to keep active walking<br> :date: __2021-05-06 21:53:22__

> This is a good app<br> :date: __2021-05-01 14:37:10__

> Sometimes I walk fast and the tracker doesn't register it as brisk. I didn't realise the phone had to be on my person; not in a handbag.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 12:50:55__

> The first couple of minutes don't register however brisk you walk so it's best not to stop. Otherwise it's a good help to measuring your walks<br> :date: __2021-04-28 08:54:51__

> No baseline assessment to measure whst is "brisk" for me. Makes you feel good when you notch up a chunk of brisk minutes, motivating to make me reach the next 10.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 11:17:55__

> This app is quite good, but only for mapping your walks. It would be good if it included other activities such as gardening, going to the gym, swimming etc.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 18:00:27__

> Wish it would show the miles I have walked. I'm sure it used too. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-04-30 17:02:41__

> Not very accurate - when walking with someone else who uses the app, they have hugely different results! It's good for making you walk fast though<br> :date: __2021-04-25 17:59:26__

> Not sure how accurate the measurement of brisk walking is. But it certainly raises awareness.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 23:59:09__

> What is counted as brisk seems quite random. If I use it when I'm dancing, it will record 30 mins as brisk one day, then nothing the next even though I'm doing the same dances to the same tracks.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 22:35:47__

> Would be nice to have a step counter and distance built in<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:57:08__

> It started really well, and I would have scored higher, but for some reason over the past couple of weeks it is recording my car journeys too. ( And not showing up as brisk during this time😂) I've checked to see if there is anything I need to change in settings, but nothing. Shame asvi was really enjoying it, but can't rely on the data any more. So frustrating.<br> :date: __2021-04-15 15:07:55__

> stopped working, reinstalled twice, still not working, Have reinstall after a while. Working much better<br> :date: __2021-04-14 08:44:45__

> Moved to anew and in all othe respects reliable huawei p30 Pro. Suddenly the app is highly erratic in what it deems is an active pace and is under recording the same. I know by timing myself I am walking at 130 steps per minute, the app recognises I'm walking but does not record these as brisk minutes in a cases. I suspect its recording brisk for less than half the actual brisk walked<br> :date: __2021-04-13 21:26:39__

> The app counts cycling as brisk walking... It's just not right. Hope it get fixed.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 18:57:09__

> It does not register brisk walking properly. I walk with my daughter both using active 10, mine shows very little brisk walking compared with hers. Rubbish.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 15:25:57__

> Doesn't always work<br> :date: __2021-05-10 20:48:27__

> Stopped tracking. Worked well 1st week but now doesn't track my walking at all. Annoying as I walk for an hour and half each day and am interested in seeing how I'm doing<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:47:44__

> Generally good and has motivated me to get a faster pace and do that for me time. Some irritations, however. I would like to set a (much) higher target but 30 mins a day is the maximum. Also, totals seem very slow to update at times and you have to close the app and open again. E.g. Its Sunday and yet my Saturday walk was still not reflected in the weekly figurea until I shut the app. Updated, data for several days lost, so reducing rating to 2 stars.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 15:14:40__

> Doesn't work properly. Very inaccurate at times.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 15:50:00__

> I can't get the app to work, my data has disappeared and won't load back on. I have uninstalled and reinstalled after a few days but still nothing<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:13:15__

> Really good idea in theory but the measurement of brisk is not accurate in my opinion, which negates the whole idea of the app. Think I'd need to be practically sprinting for brisk to register.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 22:56:03__

> Not reliable, I do the same walk each week in the same time sometimes it records 100 brisk minutes other times like today 8 minutes<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:45:18__

> It just doesn't register much of my brisk walking. Seems completely random, some days all is fine, other days only about 10% registers.<br> :date: __2021-03-06 17:09:46__

> Hopeless. Doesn't record minutes of walking accurately let alone minutes of brisk walking. Today I walked briskly for 30 minutes but only 24 minutes of walking was recorded and just 8 were recorded as "brisk". So I practically ran for 5 minutes, then walked briskly for another 5, to try and push the brisk minutes up. No additional minutes of walking, brisk or otherwise were recorded. It stuck at 24 and 8. It was fine for a couple of days but hasn't recorded accurately since then.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 18:22:31__

> Didn't find this app useful because what I felt was a brisk walk for me didn't register leaving me feeling disheartened. ☹️<br> :date: __2021-04-29 19:09:50__

> It has been working fine, then for the last month it has been awful! Not recording the correct time I'd been walking! Told me I'd walked one minute and I'd actually done 30 minutes!<br> :date: __2021-04-27 11:54:05__

> ever since new update in Feb the app cannot get my walking info or it says I'm missing data<br> :date: __2021-04-19 00:57:31__

> This was so simple, but now useless. It just stopped working; used to record approx. time walking and time spent brisk walking - now nothing! Latest version of Android, Pixel 3a<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:32:21__

> Infuriating. I walk briskly for 30mins and it clocks up two cups and a few minutes, a couple of hours later I open the app up prior to walking and its reset to 1 cup and 1 minute. This has happened every day since I downloaded it (3 days) Seemed to settle down but suddenly keeps trying to load and says "we don't seem to be able to access your data"<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:47:38__

> Another waste of time and space doesn't help at all<br> :date: __2021-04-05 01:16:21__

> This app used to be great but when I resumed this month after a break it simply doesn't work. Constantly trying to load data and never does. Downgraded from a 5 star review. Sort it please.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 09:46:06__

> Very hit and miss in the measurement of "brisk" walking, well basically random. Good idea but poorly developed.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 00:56:02__

> Not fit for purpose. Doesn't record anything.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 03:20:55__

| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App is now working again. And I'm happy again.😁 But apprehensive...<br> :date: __2021-05-14 13:26:14__

> This app is 10 times better than Patient Access. It's very interactive and keeps the user up to date in many areas like health and well being, including your rights as a patient to having access to your records.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 09:35:47__

> not fully user friendly, it's not obvious how to get things done, needs some getting used to to navigate. otherwise works very well.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:01:56__

> Works well. Limited functionality - presumably due to government and surgery constraints<br> :date: __2021-04-09 10:06:27__

> Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.<br> :date: __2021-01-02 10:15:46__

> Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery. Lots can be improved and would be happy to provide feedback if the product team want to contact me.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 11:01:12__

> hard to log in with biometrics<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:41:35__

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

> Wont let me get on to log in<br> :date: __2021-03-09 18:33:29__
