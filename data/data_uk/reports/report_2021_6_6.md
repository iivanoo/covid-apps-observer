The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

### Description

<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App appeared fine until a few days ago - now appears to be perpetually hung on 'checking exposure keys'<br> :date: __2021-06-01 22:19:34__

> App appears Okay on the Samsung TvPhone<br> :date: __2021-05-23 06:18:35__

> Not sure if this app actually does anything. Only seems to do a check when I open it. App can go days with no checking for contacts according to the fingerprint checking Google summary page.<br> :date: __2021-04-24 18:55:23__

> As people from other area's in the UK visit Scotland I don't believe the app syncs with other apps from other locations in the UK but only Scotland. If this is the case then it won't work unless someone in Scotland develops covid and others have this same version.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 14:37:32__

> Huawei 30pro. It doesn't recognize that my Bluetooth is on and so does not activate.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 11:02:15__

> This might just be the most effective software to be Bluetooth turned on all the time to enable almost everyone in Scotland to track&trace possible SARS/covid carriers,..<br> :date: __2021-04-04 11:33:48__

> Early version seemed fine, sat happily in background, but now app complains when I don't have Bluetooth or location on at home.<br> :date: __2021-03-25 11:07:01__

> Couldn't add my positive code to the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 01:02:01__

> Of questionable usability. Stay at home, and this app will still keep nagging you to switch on location - presumably the vision of the Covid hordes invading your dwelling makes spending battery power on satellite navigation worthwhile. Now, I remember The Omega Man from the first time around (1971 film), but did the designer of this really do so too? 🤔 I'd rather not be nagged at home to turn this on, thanks.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:13:23__

They sell coffee at a door where people congregate on a pavement less than two meters to get past?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:03:34__

> Gave me a notification saying I had been in contact with someone with covid and had to self isolate....10 days AFTER I had been in contact with them and I only had to isolate for 1 day?? Not convinced it works or it is very slow to update you.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:05:01__

> When I first got the App I thought it was great to have it but now I am convinced it doesn't work giving people false confidence they've not been in contact with Covid, I have been in close contact with covid infected people yet never had notification. I think its flawed by requiring people to self input if they have it. Yet reading other reviews such as people in same household both entering details and none being informed that they've been in close contact? Raises suspension app authenticity<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:44:35__

> I was quite naive and feeling safe because I hwe receuved zero contact alerts, so was blissfully confident that I was OK. Until today that is, when I discovered that a) there was an update that was not automatically applied, b) there are so many criticisms of the app and c) so many complaint communucations to the developer remain unanswered.... Is the app a complete con? Is it just to calm the naive and stupid like me. I had not encountered any issues, but then I didn't expect to.. I was safe???<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:07:48__

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

> Personally I think the Channel Islands as a whole should use a combined system instead of separatist nature. I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:29:22__

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

> 👍😎<br> :date: __2020-11-05 21:22:14__

> So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> This app is really easy and fast and doesn't have too much of an impact on your battery life<br> :date: __2020-08-18 01:16:04__

> Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:12__

> No instructions on how it works<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:03:07__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

> Covid test question needs an 'unknown' option. I've been tested before, with negative result, but months ago, so saying my 'current status' is negative is misleading, but I can't say I've 'Never' been tested. Could also be used by those who've had a test, but awaiting results. There should be a definition of what 'current' means too. The question on whether you think you've had Covid needs a 'Maybe' option. I think I may have, but mildly & not the obvious symptoms so not confident to say 'Yes'.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:47:12__

> So, well, this app only gets your data: you send your talk, your cough, your data, and that's it. It gives you back nothing. You contribute to science. The problem here is: why don't they give me back the result of my data, based on the data they accumulated? This is not fair, no matter how much the data is valuable/correct. Just give me the output, even if just for curiosity. You state that the app is 98% correct. So there's no reason to be so shy. Also: this app would render the swab completely useless. Maybe the app doesn't give back the results so to not destroy the market of a perfectly useless device like the swab? I can see no other reason.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:10:40__

### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> App works well up having to upload the camcorder section ,then left in limbo<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:56:45__

> I managed to register myself and my wife separately, as didn't realise I would be able to get her linked to mine, with a few problems with proving ID. Works ok, though sometimes seems to have a glitch. I wanted full access, so have contacted my GP. It has been set up from their end, with me also having proxy access to my wife. I am able to get the full proxy access to my wife but no full access for either of us in own accounts. not sure where problem is though.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 20:27:06__

> Works pretty well for me...<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:42:57__

> Very easy to join, maybe because already knowing NHS number, very straightforward. No need to add passport details etc as mentioned on other reviews. Hopefully we will be able to use it as proof of vaccinations when travelling without having to download any other app.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 17:31:41__

> Very good. Takes a bit of time to set up if you don't have all the required details but easy if you do have them.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 09:33:07__

> Took sometime to sort I.D...managed to print off covid paperwork..but why is it valid for only 3 weeks ????<br> :date: __2021-06-01 19:40:55__

> Understand you need to verify, can be fidly to get right<br> :date: __2021-05-31 15:01:13__

> Great application. I managed to get my GP to approve a continuous order for my medication Through the app. without me having to call the GP or book an appointment. Very useful app. I'll give 5 stars if this app will give me the chance to get Covid-19 Vaccine certificate as proof for travel and for any other required reason. I wonder if this app will be approved to use as a green pass to travel.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 21:56:41__

> WINDOWS 10. OPEN GOOGLE PLAY FOR NHS APP. ADVISED THAT APP IS INSTALLED. UNABLE TO FIND IT. CHECKED "DOWLOADS" NOT THERE. SELECTED "INSTALLED" . SELECTED "INSTALL" just in case. NO RESPONSE. ANY IDEAS? HAVE DOWNLOADED IT ONTO MY PHONE SUCCESSFULLY.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:28:40__

> The app works really well. My only issue is that I can't fully utilise it as my doctor does not have the online appointment facility. Otherwise, I really like it.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 09:55:54__

> Just the camcorder section don't confirm things<br> :date: __2021-06-02 10:48:13__

> Setup was flawless, however and it's a big however it is only displaying my records from my new GP surgery! This is a bit silly as I hardly have any records here and most are at my old surgery... Also I was kind of expecting to see all my NHS hospital records in the APP which I can't see anywhere.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 20:20:11__

> Not very easy to use and set up the same issues with my GPS e consult service. I am above average with technology and I really struggled to set it all up. I understand the NHS is so pushed to the limit but the service made me want to give up if it wasn't so important.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 18:48:18__

> Surprised how little information was required to access my medical details. I used different email address than the surgery knows about, but might have used the same phone as I've given the surgery, so perhaps they have taken the opportunity to validate that the phone details I entered in the app match what the surgery holds. The surgery has emailed me to say I can now use the NHS app, but has failed to warn me what I should do if it was not me that has attempted access my details with the app.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 02:49:50__

> Don't expect or need this to do much except to prove I've had the covid jabs. So frustrating that it won't allow Google to remember log in. Why?<br> :date: __2021-05-28 20:31:01__

> This app is not very good. My husband downloaded the app so that he would have access to his covid status. On checking his vaccination details are completely wrong. Have sent details, still waiting for a reply. Also my doctors don't use this app....have now taken advice as given by NHS and problem has been sorted.<br> :date: __2021-05-28 10:39:25__

> Worked great initially but after a week it now fails to allow me to log in (with a '3a' error code). Repeated failed attempts over 24 hours have led me to conclude it's not fit for purpose. Update for the Devs: I've submitted two reports and both have simply come back with the (automated) reply that I should give it 30 mins or so. Since then I have had no response.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 14:24:36__

> (at the time of my original review it was possible to book a vaccination through the app) Booking a COVID jab is impossible, everyone is booking the same appointments concurrently which makes it impossible to complete a booking, and if there is no second appointments available why show the original appointments, same issue with the arrival times. It seems to be also not handling the volume of requests either as it keeps going down. You'd think for a critical gov tech infrastructure you'd think about handling spikes in traffic better. I have a few smaller gripes with the ui also.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 15:09:49__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

> I've never been a runner before. Every time I tried getting into it in the gym, I'd get bored and injure myself. This app is utterly brilliant. I thought week 1 run 1 would kill me but have stuck with it, taking each run slowly and trusting what my 'coach' (Jo Whiley) was telling me. I've just completed run 3 of week 7, which was 25 minutes non-stop. It's longer than I have ever run before and the weirdest thing is I actually enjoyed it!<br> :date: __2021-06-06 12:09:44__

> I've downloaded this a few times but this time I've managed to get through it and I have never felt more energised and healthy, such a good app and Jo Whileys voice (hope I spelt her name right) was absolutely perfect for the motivation. One thing I would recommend is doing it with someone aswell, it helps so much during the hard times<br> :date: __2021-06-06 02:05:14__

> Fantastic. App so well developed that it can make you into a runner in 9 weeks safely, without injury & making you realise you can become a runner. I have continued for one year having started the app in March 2020.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 14:59:50__

> Wish there was music included in the runs<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:27:25__

> The only annoying thing is that once the app is running, it disappears on my phone so I can't pause it or stop it until that run is finished. I have had to resort to switching off my phone to stop it talking at me, on a couple of occasions when my plans changed and I needed to do something else.<br> :date: __2021-06-04 10:21:18__

> Cool but can cut out at times<br> :date: __2021-06-03 21:47:18__

> A good plan very supportive.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 15:48:33__

> Great way to get into fitness and something new. Sometimes cuts out but could be phone rather than app.<br> :date: __2021-06-03 09:43:15__

> Really good app. Wish it had more voices but loving Sarah Millican. Cuts in and out of my music, sometimes with a delay going back to full music volume but I have figured out a workaround on that. Anywau, great app...would not be able to master running without it!<br> :date: __2021-06-03 07:44:46__

> So good to use with easy interface. Only took star off as occasionally it doesn't save the run you have just done, if you don't save it very quickly. But a brilliant app nevertheless<br> :date: __2021-06-02 22:09:53__

> Great app but I feel I need a couch to 10k now. That's the only thing. Different stages of training.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 16:07:18__

> Jo Whiley is the best motivational voice on this app<br> :date: __2021-06-01 11:56:19__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs. Finally completed the couch to 5k app, really helped me get fitness up<br> :date: __2021-06-02 21:33:32__

> Never thought I'd be running for these distances & times. Also never thought I'd enjoy running! App programme is excellent & having Michael Johnson egging me on helped haha. EDIT: lowered to 3 stars as you appear to have removed Michael Johnson.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:04:41__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:26:33__

> Keeps crashing every minute and a half so I can't use it at all.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 13:53:53__

> Works perfectly on an iPhone, pretty terrible on a Samsung galaxy.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 03:34:32__

> It's great it tells you what to do but not so great you can't play music in the background, even with the options it gives you, it stops when the speaker starts talking.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 15:42:44__

> The instructors talk far too much. It's not a podcast.<br> :date: __2021-04-30 18:14:37__

> Good overall app but it sometimes crashes halfway through a run so you have to make up the rest of your run as an estimate. I am also now struggling to open the app up as I write this review. When the app works it is really good but overall seems a little bit buggy<br> :date: __2021-04-30 14:51:37__

> Great app to keep you on track running and helping reach goals. Would be 5 star but for the week 6 runs, the first two seem to be round the wrong way and from week 6 onwards, none of the runs save at the end and the app doesn't seem to recognise I've started. So I start the app and go running, then if I go to reopen the app during the run it wants me to start again but the prompts and notifications still sound. So if you do start again you get the prompts duplicating which is confusing!<br> :date: __2021-04-28 18:54:59__

> It's really helpful, there aren't many options for the trainers. It is slow to download but there are great choices for times. You also get a reminder which is also good for someone like me who has bad memory and no motivation.<br> :date: __2021-04-27 13:13:17__

> So far on week 3 going into 4 I feel more confidence on finishing each run. I am hopeful that the next few weeks will be as positive on both my mind and body.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 10:47:42__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

> So far I have seen my fitness build using the program however the app is quite buggy. The most annoying bug is that once I have hit start run if I switch to a different app e.g. music player, the audio continues but the timer within the app stops completely meaning at the end of my run I have to skip through the whole process because if I start it again then I get 2 sets of trainer audio at different times.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 12:23:00__

> The programme is good but I wish there were different versions to listen to for each of the week's three runs...I don't want to hear the same tips three times, especially when they interrupt my podcast! But more annoying is the fact that the app keeps silently crashing which completely messes up the workout.<br> :date: __2021-04-14 09:16:09__

> Overall the App works OK. But now I'm on the end of week 6 at 25mins of running, the App decided to NOT save that run. In the previous build it automatically prompted to save the run without worrying about losing the run record. Sadly the "new improvements" have broken it. And there is no automatic save prompt. Not great!! Please fix.<br> :date: __2021-04-13 09:53:37__

> Just started week 2 and the app keeps stopping mid-run.....really annoying when you need it for your run/walk timings<br> :date: __2021-04-12 11:00:30__

In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.
<br>For more information please visit our website at www.protegoapp.org

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> Not with enough info:as to redirecting parcel when tracking a parcel not helpful no telephone num:or chatline parcel far away from my home.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Ministry of Health and Prevention - UAE |
| **Website**  | [https://alhosnapp.ae/en/contact-us/](https://alhosnapp.ae/en/contact-us/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> As a GoodSAM 'verified responder' (St John Ambulance), the Responder app has been an amazing community tool for assisting East Midlands Ambulance Service with cardiac arrests and other similar incidents. Ambulance crews have all been happy for assistance during these calls. - Working together, this is a lifesaving app. I did notice that prior to being a verified responder for St John that if you just have a first aid certificate, it's very unlikely that you'll get a call out, but this is down to the policy of your local ambulance provider and not the app.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 12:26:07__

> Well designed and simple. Great work. For future tasks I would love to save a filter on date, or day of week. I would be more likely to find a steward shift I can attend.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 15:01:30__

> Can we have a filter option by day of the week or time under future tasks, please? Sometimes with more than several hundreds on that list it is very difficult to find the relevant ones for VSS roles. Many thanks.<br> :date: __2021-05-21 10:00:55__

> Works for me. However, it would be nice to be able to list future tasks differently or offer sort by options.<br> :date: __2021-05-14 17:42:33__

> I've registered to volunteer at vaccination sites, received an email saying that they have noticed I hadn't taken up any opportunity, well that's because I haven't received any! Still receiving check in and chat and community response but nothing else.<br> :date: __2021-05-07 19:54:30__

> Please allow filtering of future tasks by day<br> :date: __2021-05-04 11:55:54__

> Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.<br> :date: __2021-03-24 06:05:24__

> Since the update, this is a good app. I still haven't had a volunteering alert for the vaccination centres yet, here's hoping!<br> :date: __2021-02-27 17:01:46__

> Seems to run well. Had no alerts yet since registering<br> :date: __2021-02-26 05:17:37__

> I got my Hi Vis jackets but im still waiting for a shift as a Vaccine Steward through the app, im not sure if you need the Duty button on or off for it but im looking forward to it.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 16:45:42__

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs<br> :date: __2021-02-11 20:30:35__

> App was working really well for me until about a week ago. Suddenly started eating data and won't display the part of my profile that allows me to go on and off duty. I have tried updating and reinstalling but still isn't working properly.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 23:34:06__

> It's hanging. Neither accept nor reject is possible. Update. I installed on a different phone and exactly the same problem exists on that. Therefore it's my account that is locked, not the app. How can I get my account working again? Uninstalled and restarted but the uninstall process is incomplete as when I reinstall and open it goes immediately to the same hanging task screen. I've Uninstalled it as its unuseable for me now.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 14:07:57__

> I was doing fine with this app, getting messages and ringing people (I only do chats as I have no transport) but now I'm having problems. On my messages it's telling me I didn't accept tasks so they were passed on. I didn't know there were tasks waiting as I'm getting no alerts. I've checked all my settings etc and all are switched on, so not sure how to solve this. I'm still willing to call people who need it, but with no alerts coming in, I don't know tasks are waiting. Please advise.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 11:27:51__

> Don't like the icon always on display when on duty. It just adds unnecessary clutter to phone screen and more importantly means I'm less likely to spot an alert which is what the icon always meant. Please change this back or at least give users the option to switch off.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 10:28:34__

> Since updating the app today to show on duty icon is on not been able to accept calls / help even though being alerted<br> :date: __2021-05-24 15:48:36__

> Good Idea. But after 814 hours on duty there is no task.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:01:12__

> Cant find a decent burger .... ppppfffffff<br> :date: __2021-03-12 14:29:29__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...<br> :date: __2021-02-11 11:50:54__

> Tried to register right now. Filled in my details and upon pressing the register button got the notification: "Couldn't send the registration link to the email provided. Is the email correct?" Yes, it is correct, because I used the "Passwort forgotten" button that send me a resetting link to the same email. Now I can't go through registration, since the registration link never reached my inbox but apparently the email did, because "this email is in use". 🙄 Will give more stars later.<br> :date: __2021-05-12 07:04:09__

All other apps give option to retain on installation. Tiresome logging in, therefore, which at times can be for remorseless alerts for assistance throughout the day.

The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location.

### Description
> Active 10 is a free and easy to use walking app that tracks your walking and shows you how you can increase your intensity to benefit your health. The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress
<br>* Store and view up to 12 months of your walking activity, to see how far you have come 
<br>* Discover loads of hints and tips on achieving a healthier lifestyle
<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Shows the total length of my walk and how many 10 minutes worth were 'brisk' which counts towards getting a reward, shows 'hat tricks' for 3 x 10 minutes in a day, 100 - 3000 club shows you ow many minutes from the day you downloaded the app, you get a high five for how many days in 7 you have taken a brisk walk. It's helping me see how much I do or don't move in a day and for me I've got start somewhere.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:58:17__

> Useful little app. Spurs you on to do more.<br> :date: __2021-05-27 21:43:09__

> Perfect for those who only need to check they've had enough exercise day by day and track how they're progressing.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 08:32:34__

> Learning more about my eating habits. Quite an eye opening.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 14:03:13__

> I wanted to find an easy way to increase my activity and found this NHS sponsored app. It has really encouraged me to get out every day for at least 20 mins walk and after less than a month I am feeling the benefits.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 08:55:22__

> I loved this app at first it's very useful as I have fibromyalgia an need to phase my exercise slowly. However the app stopped registering my brisk steps and i kept pushing harder to get those brisk mins in, the result was I pushed to hard, then it stopped working. At times I walk quickly and it doesn't register other times I walk slowly and it registers. This has been demotivating. If these issue were fixed it would be a great tool for me<br> :date: __2021-05-09 13:52:48__

> The app is great 👍<br> :date: __2021-05-09 09:25:08__

> Good incentive to keep active walking<br> :date: __2021-05-06 21:53:22__

> Very easy to use and a great indicator of brisk v strolling walking<br> :date: __2021-05-03 09:46:27__

> Useful to track walking activity which counts towards exercise targets<br> :date: __2021-05-01 18:23:41__

</p>

> It stopped working<br> :date: __2021-06-04 13:57:28__

> Brisk walk is debatable. Sometimes you almost need to run to clock up minutes. I walk on the flat as going up hill is slower and does not register brisk minutes. I do like the rewards as trophies and these are a good motivator.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 17:39:05__

> Doing the same circuit in the same time (30 minutes) gives different minutes of brisk walks eg from 30 mins down to 22. That's the same distance in the same time give or take 20 seconds. Forces you to adopt an unhealthy posture in order to walk fast enough to register a brisk walk.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 01:28:05__

> No baseline assessment to measure whst is "brisk" for me. Makes you feel good when you notch up a chunk of brisk minutes, motivating to make me reach the next 10.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 11:17:55__

> This app is quite good, but only for mapping your walks. It would be good if it included other activities such as gardening, going to the gym, swimming etc.<br> :date: __2021-05-01 18:00:27__

> Wish it would show the miles I have walked. I'm sure it used too. Disappointing<br> :date: __2021-04-30 17:02:41__

> Not very accurate - when walking with someone else who uses the app, they have hugely different results! It's good for making you walk fast though<br> :date: __2021-04-25 17:59:26__

> Not sure how accurate the measurement of brisk walking is. But it certainly raises awareness.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 23:59:09__

> What is counted as brisk seems quite random. If I use it when I'm dancing, it will record 30 mins as brisk one day, then nothing the next even though I'm doing the same dances to the same tracks.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 22:35:47__

> Would be nice to have a step counter and distance built in<br> :date: __2021-04-16 16:57:08__

</p>

> It's ok<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:42:56__

> The app counts cycling as walking... It's just not right. Hope it get fixed. Only useful for brisk, not hfor normal walk.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 16:49:12__

> It does not register brisk walking properly. I walk with my daughter both using active 10, mine shows very little brisk walking compared with hers. Rubbish.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 15:25:57__

> Doesn't always work<br> :date: __2021-05-10 20:48:27__

> Stopped tracking. Worked well 1st week but now doesn't track my walking at all. Annoying as I walk for an hour and half each day and am interested in seeing how I'm doing<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:47:44__

> Generally good and has motivated me to get a faster pace and do that for me time. Some irritations, however. I would like to set a (much) higher target but 30 mins a day is the maximum. Also, totals seem very slow to update at times and you have to close the app and open again. E.g. Its Sunday and yet my Saturday walk was still not reflected in the weekly figurea until I shut the app. Updated, data for several days lost, so reducing rating to 2 stars.<br> :date: __2021-04-18 15:14:40__

> Doesn't work properly. Very inaccurate at times.<br> :date: __2021-04-16 15:50:00__

> I can't get the app to work, my data has disappeared and won't load back on. I have uninstalled and reinstalled after a few days but still nothing<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:13:15__

> Really good idea in theory but the measurement of brisk is not accurate in my opinion, which negates the whole idea of the app. Think I'd need to be practically sprinting for brisk to register.<br> :date: __2021-04-07 22:56:03__

> Not reliable, I do the same walk each week in the same time sometimes it records 100 brisk minutes other times like today 8 minutes<br> :date: __2021-03-18 17:45:18__

</p>

> I loved this app when I first started using it, as it was an easy way to keep track of my progress, but like others, I'm finding that it keeps stripping out all of my stats, so starting to think I'll not bother using it anymore unless a fix is done very soon - such a shame I tried using the app again recently and it appears to have stopped working completely now, so not tracking any minutes at all, app needs updating!!<br> :date: __2021-05-25 08:16:26__

> Hopeless. Doesn't record minutes of walking accurately let alone minutes of brisk walking. Today I walked briskly for 30 minutes but only 24 minutes of walking was recorded and just 8 were recorded as "brisk". So I practically ran for 5 minutes, then walked briskly for another 5, to try and push the brisk minutes up. No additional minutes of walking, brisk or otherwise were recorded. It stuck at 24 and 8. It was fine for a couple of days but hasn't recorded accurately since then.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 18:22:31__

> Didn't find this app useful because what I felt was a brisk walk for me didn't register leaving me feeling disheartened. ☹️<br> :date: __2021-04-29 19:09:50__

> It has been working fine, then for the last month it has been awful! Not recording the correct time I'd been walking! Told me I'd walked one minute and I'd actually done 30 minutes!<br> :date: __2021-04-27 11:54:05__

> ever since new update in Feb the app cannot get my walking info or it says I'm missing data<br> :date: __2021-04-19 00:57:31__

> This was so simple, but now useless. It just stopped working; used to record approx. time walking and time spent brisk walking - now nothing! Latest version of Android, Pixel 3a<br> :date: __2021-04-18 18:32:21__

> Infuriating. I walk briskly for 30mins and it clocks up two cups and a few minutes, a couple of hours later I open the app up prior to walking and its reset to 1 cup and 1 minute. This has happened every day since I downloaded it (3 days) Seemed to settle down but suddenly keeps trying to load and says "we don't seem to be able to access your data"<br> :date: __2021-04-11 13:47:38__

> Another waste of time and space doesn't help at all<br> :date: __2021-04-05 01:16:21__

> This app used to be great but when I resumed this month after a break it simply doesn't work. Constantly trying to load data and never does. Downgraded from a 5 star review. Sort it please.<br> :date: __2021-03-31 09:46:06__

> Very hit and miss in the measurement of "brisk" walking, well basically random. Good idea but poorly developed.<br> :date: __2021-03-29 00:56:02__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Your.MD |
| **Website**  | [https://www.livehealthily.com](https://www.livehealthily.com) |
| **Email** | feedback@livehealthily.com |
| **Physical address**  | [5th Floor, 43 Whitfield Street London W1T 4HD](https://www.google.com/maps/search/5th%20Floor,%2043%20Whitfield%20Street%20London%20W1T%204HD) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> This app is 10 times better than Patient Access. It's very interactive and keeps the user up to date in many areas like health and well being, including your rights as a patient to having access to your records.<br> :date: __2021-05-02 09:35:47__

> not fully user friendly, it's not obvious how to get things done, needs some getting used to to navigate. otherwise works very well.<br> :date: __2021-04-19 22:01:56__

> Can be glitchy. Biometric login often doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 15:06:02__

> Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery. Lots can be improved and would be happy to provide feedback if the product team want to contact me.<br> :date: __2021-05-17 11:01:12__

> hard to log in with biometrics<br> :date: __2021-04-13 19:41:35__

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | - |
| **Email** | emma@dalzell.com |
