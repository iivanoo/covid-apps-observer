Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

### Description
> Overview
<br>The COVIDCare NI app has been developed by Digital Health and Care NI in partnership with Health & Social Care, the Public Health Agency and the Department of Health.

<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.
<br>Why use the app?
<br>The app is available for use in Northern Ireland to all individuals who are currently residing in Northern Ireland.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

> Could do with more updates. But pretty good for sign posting<br> :date: __2020-06-29 12:39:16__

> Quite good app as has a symptoms checker and some info, advice and statistics.. However doesn't have what I actually downloaded it for which was to find out about updates to current regulations and recovery plan such as easing of lockdown rules etc.. Have to search for this and then visit nidirect website for this info..<br> :date: __2020-06-07 21:55:20__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-05-06 23:22:23__

> Great app, though the virtual assistant could use some more specific information / ai training. Thanks for making this.<br> :date: __2020-04-02 10:48:28__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Why not build a option in app to check other locations on the Covid-19 but on other country app the have that it's more accurate e.g Turkey, Germany and many other to just by putting in the street or address of your relatives to the Covid-19 cases but that what could improve the app doesn't have to be just put an address but just changeable post code so that people can see the rates before heading anywhere but because were tier 3 it seem just to late to get it done, i hope you can see it<br> :date: __2020-12-19 00:13:54__

> since national lockdown ended the app has not been working. I got repeated pop ups saying it had stopped working so I uninstalled and reinstalled it.

I saw it needed update and now its not showing with needing to isolate, so no idea. I rang nhs 111 as the covid one wasn't open at the time at the time as I was abouting to start work at 3am, they wasn't sure as they aint heard of 3 days isolation.

How do I use the app to know how much exposure I have had in my daily life? Without feedback from the app I have discovered that many people assume it doesn't work and have stopped using it. Poorly designed.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 10:23:11__

> App is ok but my partner has been told to isolate for 5 days. After trying to find out why it is so short there isn't anything or explanation to why. I was on the understanding it's 14 days which has recently changed to 10 but this still doesn't explain why she has to only do half that?????????? So either the app is wrong or its putting other people at risk if she was to develop symptoms.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 01:25:04__

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Following the latest update It appears my phone had turned off the exposure notifications switch in settings / Google/ covid-19 exposure notifications. What is worrying was / is the Protect Scotland app did not notify me in any way, until I happened to open the app by chance and only then did a warning appear. Why doesn't the app generate a warning every time it tries to check or update it's database ? It seems a very basic failing. ☹️😳 Also why no exposure checks reported anymore ?<br> :date: __2020-12-19 02:35:30__

> I WASNT NOTIFIED OF MY EXPOSURE TO SOMEONE WHO TESTED POSITIVE WITH COVID-19 TILL 6 DAYS LATER. NOT MUCH GOOD IF I HAD OF UNKNOWINGLY BEEN POSITIVE AND ASYMPTOMATIC.

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Just discovered the app had been "Auto Disabled" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).<br> :date: __2020-10-21 23:33:44__

> Please add the capacity to scan QR codes like the NHS app does, not having this function leads to confusion in dealing with GB businesses in NI<br> :date: __2020-10-10 08:57:01__

> It seems to work, and I really hope it does.. it is simple, and not intrusive. I look forward to seeing his it pans out.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 01:00:45__

> This app only checks exposure if it comes within a short distance of someone else who has the app. No exposure checks mean you havent been close enough to someone for it to check.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:06:28__

> QUERY! If having to move devices, how are you supposed to transfer the existing exposure checks from the previous 14 days to the new device, in case any of those report a positive case?<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:39:02__

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

> No problems downloading and it appears active on my Samsung S10. Would love to understand more about the keys as we're registering them without leaving the house!<br> :date: __2020-08-12 22:11:42__

> Seems to work just fine, but the interface is slow and it's hard to know if this is actually running or if I have to load up the app manually every time.<br> :date: __2020-08-07 11:52:24__

> I found it easily, I just typed in covid and found the app. But like others have said, when you close the app and open it it says tracing not active then changes to active. Unsure if it is working when the app isn't open.<br> :date: __2020-08-04 11:47:01__

> Downloaded this when it became available, but after the last update, it keeps pushing me to turn my bluetooth on and restart the app; my Bluetooth has been on, and restarting the app doesn't help.

> I downloaded the app. I get that someone will notify me if I come into contact with someone who has the app and then tests positive. However, I feel it should give people either daily or weekly updates of places that the person has been and I wonder when two mobile phones that have the app downloaded on the phones - do they react to each other. Another thing is people on the island of ireland both north and south of the island should be able to use both apps together.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 23:59:37__

> So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> Downloaded, installed and turned on notifications no problem - very easy. Yes, it does automatically turn on your Bluetooth which drains the battery faster but I'm keeping it on only when I'm outside my house&work, e.g.shopping.<br> :date: __2020-07-19 23:06:12__

> No instructions on how it works<br> :date: __2020-08-03 21:03:07__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

> This App is not designed for th UK, it is designed only for Gibraltar the app is useless, contact the developer like i did, UK citizen you will be told we can't use it in the UK 🇬🇧 This is their response "This App has been developed specifically with Gibraltar in mind. It is open for download by anyone, including cross-frontier workers and persons who regularly visit Gibraltar. If you are not in Gibraltar (whether residing, working or visiting) this app is of no real use to you"<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:25:30__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I can't create the account as the create account button doesn't work. Frustrating as I am 100% sure I am on day 9 of COVID 19 symptoms, and I have no doubt that cases are being massively under-reported in the UK. 7/4/20 Working well last few days! 20/12/20 Worked well for me for 6 months with no problems.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:36:40__

> Very easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 17:22:02__

> Initially, I was surprised at how much personal information it wanted...height, weight etc, but then I remembered that it is gathering data about people, related to vulnerability to Covid, and being overweight or obese, is relevant. Around 19th Dec, the notifications to log in daily details stopped on my phone. I did start getting them on my tablet a while ago, so I'm doing them on my tablet. Just a bit worrying that I can't access the app on my phone any more.<br> :date: __2020-12-20 16:43:20__

> Easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:56:03__

> The app is a good reminder to check in, especially with notifications on. Unfortunately however if you accidentally press certain options it is impossible to go back on some pages, which is quite a flaw. For example, I've never had a Covid 19 Vaccine but the app insists I have.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 16:39:06__

> Use this app. It's vital! However the recent intro of vaccine use has prevented me from reporting. I made the miatake of saying yes ro vaccine when I've not had one. Please update to allow for error recovery. I cannot change the vaccine flag so it keeps asking me questions about "my vaccination". Hope you can help<br> :date: __2020-12-19 19:07:20__

> Haven't been getting reminders for a few weeks now, so keep forgetting to report. Even after several updates. All settings checked (background data, battery saver etc, but still no good)<br> :date: __2020-12-19 17:56:17__

> I have used this app daily for months, now after an update it no longer works. A blank white screen is all that I get !<br> :date: __2020-12-19 12:46:32__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |

| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=NHS+Digital) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Followed advice & deleted 2 older apps to free up storage. Tried again. It is still in a "Pending" status. All my other apps work, the only one trying to update is NHS. It's NHS update Got a recommendation to upgrade the app but all you see is the "washing machine" going round, and round, and round..... still in a pending state and you cannot go back and use the previous version. Wanted to check a medical appointment but now can't. Does not look like this upgrade release has been fully tested!!<br> :date: __2020-12-18 16:47:56__

> Needs more details Why I can't see my health records like blood test results or scan results or even what is the problem that I suffer Please put that in the App That's right of our rights as patients,<br> :date: __2020-12-18 12:33:42__

> I have not used it much yet don't know how good it is.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:40:41__

> Generally the app is very good but I've found one "flaw" and one bug Bug: If you try to re-enable fingerprint access, after it has apparently been turned off due to "a change" on my device, the app crashes as soon as I slide the "enable fingerprint" switch. Flaw: pressing the back button brings up the option to log out, rather than just take me back a screen as is more normal. Fix is to reinstall the app. Samsung S7 edge.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 01:53:09__

> Finally let me log in but no records, repeat prescriptions or anything show. I can't book a GP appointment. My GP records don't show my personal changes in records.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 16:39:50__

> Is there an NHS app for Scotland. I tried to register using the app but it does not recognise the information because I reside in Scotland not England.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 15:24:06__

> Not used yet<br> :date: __2020-12-10 12:24:17__

> Having trouble verifing my I. D, try to take a video but it takes me to files not video. Already messaged about this but none of advice worked. Very frustrating as it also kicks me off the site so have to log back in all the time.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 17:31:23__

> My GP and Physio already use other platforms, so this really isnt that useful .... Prob will be ok once active systems start to work with it<br> :date: __2020-12-08 03:01:06__

> The app is fine when it works but on more than three occasions have had to chace up my electronic prescription as not recieved by pharmacy. Leaving me very low or without medication and stressed having to contact my GP for paper script at a time they are asking people not to attend if necessary.<br> :date: __2020-12-07 17:18:37__

> After settling into using the app for Months, suddenly without reason or warning my online delivery pharmacist was changed to a "collect only" service from a village chemist miles away. The restoration of normal service was a pain in the ass & only possible by re registration on my chosen chemist's website. It seems to have begun, though its not confirmed. As an interim, prescriptions will be delivered to a chemist shop nearer my home. Why mess about like this!?? Is the app or NHS at fault?<br> :date: __2020-12-15 22:29:00__

Whenever I got to the point to upload an image, for sending photo id, to take a photo or upload a video, nothing happened when i tapped the camera icon! Seems certain random aspects of things on PHE/NHS apps don't seem to work on a Huawei P20! In the end i had to complete the registration process using an old SAMSUNG phone!

> Still can't organise a repeat prescription on this app really annoying 👎<br> :date: __2020-12-04 10:24:14__

> Basic software! temperamental - it crashes often, which is rather annoying. Reflects how bad the healthcare system is, unfortunately. We expect much, much more & we should be getting it!! The app is nothing special, no features to help patients be informed & take action regarding our own health. My advice is to avoid the app. Use ya Internet browser to access your records via systmonline (sign up required). "C'mon developers where's ya spunk? Whats soo hard? (not me...) Get with the program!"<br> :date: __2020-12-03 11:31:34__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

> I LOVE this! The coaches are kind and encouraging, I just finished my last run and did 5 whole k!!!! That was unimaginable weeks ago, please try it if you want to get fit or start running! Only thing, it crashes a couple times if you exist the app by accident or an alarm goes off. Not too bad though! Nice!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 16:42:33__

> I found the app really helpful to keep to the weekly targets. I had to change my 'coach' after week 3 as my phone wouldn't let me continue with Michael Johnson. So I chose Jo Whiley and glad that I did. Was good to be able to play music too..just remember to put it on first before opening couch to 5k. Although I've managed to run for 30 mins now I'm a bit slow and not reached the full 5k so at least have that now to set as a target.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:34:10__

> More comentry during run and walk sessions like countdown would be good<br> :date: __2020-12-17 16:08:08__

> Starts off well but it's so frustrating that it crashes or stops working mid run!<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:44:52__

> Good but it shuts down when running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:11:11__

> Worked well for the most part, but the app was prone to stopping mid-run; after an ever-lengthening period of silence it was demoralising to check and find that all the progress was lost. I took to using a backup stopwatch after the first few instances of this. The motivation comments were ok, but disappointed that in Weeks 8 & 9, each of the three days were exactly the same recordings; not at all inspiring and a bit cheapskate. Anyway, I achieved what I set out to do, so app successful overall.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 12:20:07__

> Good app but times out a lot if your phone screen does not stay active. Also not good at tracking real time. My phone timer was more useful. But a great intro to running<br> :date: __2020-12-12 11:32:55__

> Good to start with but once you got to the weeks you have to do long runs like for example 5mins non-stop if the phone screen goes to the sleep the app would crush and if you go back to the app it takes you back to the beginning in the middle of your run which was too stressful at times<br> :date: __2020-12-11 17:10:09__

> Nothing to signal that I've completed runs when I have, not sure if this is a bug. Also keeps bringing up a message to say I need to select a different coach as the one I have selected is unavailable.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 21:40:21__

> The app was amazing to start with but over weeks 8 and 9 it has been crashing and losing progress shortly after the 10 minute update every time I run. This has been hugely frustrating. I am so glad I was using Strava too or I would have lost my place / progress completely. In the earlier weeks I found the app really effective. It's a good build up and the encouraging messages and updates through the running really kept me going.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:55:53__

> Would be 5 stars if the sound worked!!<br> :date: __2020-12-05 15:43:45__

> The app is a great idea and well thought out. Having a coach is nice and I like that it has a reminder feature. However, the app consistantly crashes at least twice during a run. Not so bad when you are on a walking session, but particularly annoying when you are running. I have set the recommended power settings for my phone but it still crashes. Also it often asks me to reset the trainer as the audio is not available or my phone is out of memory (not true).So nice idea if it worked properly.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:26:39__

> I was really pleased with this app however on week two it lost all of the sound (the instructions) which quite frankly makes it useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it hasn't made the slightest bit of difference. A real shame!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 14:46:07__

> I love the guides running, however the app simply doesn't work properly. I have changed the settings to manage manually multiple times yet it always stops mid run. Whenever you reopen the app, you have to start the run all over again. Please fix this, it's a real pity.<br> :date: __2020-12-06 15:49:04__

> Lovely app but the sound would not work. Had to run holding the phone so I could see the instructions. I have a Pixel 3 and wonder if this is the reason it doesn't work properly. Would really like to be able to use this app fully!<br> :date: __2020-12-02 09:31:02__

> Keeps restarting so. I. Have to stop and go back to where I was in the work out<br> :date: __2020-11-30 23:10:00__

> Make sure you have a stopwatch as this app constantly crashes.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 07:30:07__

> The app keeps stopping mid run. If it did not do this is would be brilliant.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 00:39:33__

> The programme is great and the app worked brilliantly over the summer when I first used it. I'm not doing the programme again at a faster speed and I'm having problems with the app asking me to reset the trainer because I'm out of memory (not true) and resets the trainer every time I go out. Please can you review for bugs. Also this time there must have been an update as the podcast no longer stops the background audio when the trainer comes on. This is annoying as I miss patches from the audio.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 10:59:00__

> This app wouldn't work with headphones and so everyone around you can hear it.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:45:47__

> The plans are great I love that I can listen to my own music.. but... This app keeps crashing it can happen 3 to 4 times a run meaning you loose track of where you are. It happens every time my phone locks and its very demotivating. Please fix soon!!!<br> :date: __2020-11-26 19:10:02__

In the help section it doesn't list my phone or it's EMUI so it doesn't look like it's compatible with the newer versions. Hopefully they will update the app at some point. It's so disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 20:46:44__

> app keeps crashing mid run. waste of time<br> :date: __2020-12-02 20:12:29__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run. It never completes a run now. At least I do.<br> :date: __2020-11-30 20:00:50__

> Crashes unexpectedly constantly and therefore making it pretty unusable.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 23:02:15__

> Originally gave this 5 stars but for the last few weeks it has crashed mid-run without warning, leaving me running and waiting for the coach to tell me to stop! I'm looking for a more stable alternative.<br> :date: __2020-11-26 18:01:36__

### Description
> The Ministry of AYUSH presents the “Ayush Sanjivani” mobile application for understanding the measures adopted by public for enhancing immunity and keeping themselves healthy in the difficult COVID-19 situation. The app is designed as a simple but effective mechanism of electronic documentation for studying population behaviour. Response of the public to the advisories issued by the AYUSH Ministry on immunity enhancement will be an important area of examination. In addition, provision is also made for recording other measures (if any) propagated by AYUSH practitioners and adopted by general public for immunity enhancement and disease prevention. Data collected through this app will be analyzed to find out usage of AYUSH interventions and its efficacy in maintaining health by enhancing immunity.
<br>This app is at the centre of a massive exercise to study specific health seeking behaviours of the public in which the Central Research Councils of AYUSH, the National Institutes of AYUSH, numerous AYUSH educational institutions and state governments bodies collaborate. The Ministry has a target sample size of 1 million people for this study, making it one of the largest in any discipline of medicine. All those who volunteer to furnish information through this app will be making a significant contribution to the study of public health in the country.
<br>Data collected will be analyzed and will be useful for the AYUSH systems, and will establish their viability as health-assuring practices globally. This would also add momentum to the growth of the AYUSH Sector.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Ministry of AYUSH |
| **Website**  | [https://www.ayush.gov.in/](https://www.ayush.gov.in/) |
| **Email** | ayush.sanjivani@digitalindia.gov.in |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **com.google.android.c2dm.permission<br>RECEIVE** | - | -

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.

> Excellent app easy to use<br> :date: __2020-12-18 15:14:40__

> I did not spell my email address correctly but when I went in to amend found nowhere to edit my details<br> :date: __2020-12-17 14:44:41__

> I like the app. Feature request: Address book, and option to set default home address. Unless I have missed it.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 08:50:28__

> For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 02:00:45__

> Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 08:29:08__

> Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good<br> :date: __2020-12-03 15:54:52__

> If you face any problems you can't open it just change your phone's language<br> :date: __2020-12-03 05:39:13__

> Very good 😊. I think.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 07:46:14__

> Easy to arrange re-delivery of parcels.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:07:07__

> Well I used app for a redelivery and still waiting for parcel, its 20 past 6, I live in hope. Other than that app seems to be working ok.<br> :date: __2020-11-07 19:18:29__

> Great Concept Good Execution annoying gap. Like everything about this app, sending from home is great, but one thing; the need to enter your address, as sender every time is really annoying. Why doesn't it remember my details? Once fixed be good if the box to copy that from sender to the invoice address was default or unnecessary. Once that's fixed including an address book, or the ability to use addresses in your contacts, or those already in my Click and Drop profile would be a great feature.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 06:33:51__

> The post box app is good in principle but why does it tell people the time the post was collected rather than the time of the next collection, If I were catching a train I would want to know when the next one was, not the time of the one I had missed.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 18:23:14__

> Death to deeplinks!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 15:17:03__

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> App worked well. This is a comment on service App actually worked well. Dont need app but web logon out of date. I thought the 2 or 3 days delay was so that parcel could be delivered with normal post. Today a royal mail van went down road. Nope not mine. Tracking says 9.30 AM received somewhere, delivery by 9 PM. Tracking not updated all day. No indication . 21.43 still no parcel. I should have gone out for dinner but stayed in for parcel. So annoyed. I think RM has outsourced without thought<br> :date: __2020-12-18 22:46:06__

> Poor app. Better just to use the website. The QR code just directs you to the app, I expected it to be a unique, secure and handy way to redeliver but no. I don't trust this app either. You can type anything and it will go through without error - random name, random address, made up delivery number. Means if you make a mistake inadvertently your redelivery will be delayed.<br> :date: __2020-12-18 11:59:14__

> I keep getting notifications saying parcels delivered when I haven't. Finding it irritating now.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:59:31__

> A tracking app that doesn't track, pointless<br> :date: __2020-12-15 19:18:45__

> All I wanted to do is use the Parcelbox finder. But no, you have to register, putting all your details in - and there's not even a postcode search function for your address. You shouldn't have to register unless you want to actually buy something.<br> :date: __2020-12-14 12:07:49__

> Don't like the fact that they upsell their more expensive delivery options. By default, on packages, the standard 1st and 2nd class options are hidden by default - you have to specifically tick a box to show them as options. There's then a jumbled mess of 6 or 7 postage methods. All very confusing!<br> :date: __2020-12-12 23:43:53__

> In a word, clunky. The app needs to automatically populate the sender address and store card details for payment. It's really slow to use having to enter this info for every item I send. I'm logged in so should not need to re-enter this info.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:44:36__

> Can no longer rename tracked items after last update.<br> :date: __2020-12-09 13:45:17__

> Alerts for signed for parcels cone in 24hrs after delivery, doesn't help if yo don't get a card to tell you it's at a neighbours<br> :date: __2020-12-08 16:09:31__

> Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish<br> :date: __2020-11-24 16:56:31__

> Installed it, and like every other Royal Mail operation it is slow and clunky. My advice is to forget about the Royal Mail and use Hermes. A much better service.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 12:48:26__

> Limited options. To update a safe place the app forces 7ser to choose alternative delivery date. Not easy to use and when opened from email, locks the screen and won't close.<br> :date: __2020-12-19 08:16:09__

> Utter rubbish<br> :date: __2020-12-18 08:55:02__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great App, functions well. Alot of people moaning about the noise but they need to understand it was originally set up to alert responders like myself to a cardiac arrest and that this happens infrequently and needs to be loud and out there to make sure it alerts us! I have responded using it and it was very good and I know of several responders that use it well.<br> :date: __2020-12-16 10:23:43__

> Helping in times like these is vital. User friendly precise and professional.<br> :date: __2020-09-20 17:43:57__

> Always freeze accept button when I am assigned for task...don't know what's happening...<br> :date: __2020-09-14 15:21:40__

> A service that provides help for people in need. Very professional and friendly service that's was needed during the Covid 19 pandemic but still provides essential services through out the year.<br> :date: __2020-09-04 21:29:15__

> Works well! Love being a Responder<br> :date: __2020-08-26 13:45:55__

> Never had a problem with this app. Very straight forward and they are keen to improve it as it gets used more and more.<br> :date: __2020-06-19 13:17:18__

> Never had an issue with the app. I use the OHCA responder as not signed up for the NHS voluntary scheme. One glitch I do need help with. I cannot upload photo or position if a community defib. Have tried on 2 phones. Both have location and tags unlocked. But no joy. Any ideas. For those below who are not happy with the app. Keep trying. Be patient. This app has saved lives around the world. It was a steep climb for the design team to go from out of hospital cardiac arrest to what it is now<br> :date: __2020-06-12 12:32:12__

> Easy to use and extremely useful.<br> :date: __2020-06-08 21:45:43__

> Very easy to use and works as it should.<br> :date: __2020-06-03 18:05:29__

> App is good now the issue App not recording me as on call is fixed...<br> :date: __2020-05-27 11:53:31__

> App won't let me register. Freezes with a spinning wheel icon after filling in the form<br> :date: __2020-12-19 03:03:10__

> Appreciate your helpful response - sadly my area is not on the list but I noticed the link for registering my interest in case it is added in the future. Thank you and all the best<br> :date: __2020-10-08 19:52:04__

> Please give us a volume control for that dreadful siren<br> :date: __2020-09-26 15:13:11__

> Well after not bothering to log on much over the summer due to never being called on, I received an email saying more people were needing help. Plus I felt I should do something to say thank you for early access to the Track and Trace app. I logged on half an hour ago and just had my first call! She's already received help from a neighbour but was very grateful for the call.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 11:51:16__

> The app work good. But the notification siren (which I am not able to change) puts me off. Think about a loud siren in the middle of a restaurant, quite house/work place. Ability to choose between a couple of notification tones/ringtones will be of great help. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-08-20 12:13:07__

> Seems to work fine, gives plenty of information. Has been disappointing the number of requests that have come through though. Maybe it is a good thing and very few locals need support during the Pandemic.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 14:54:44__

> Up until yesterday it worked fine but now I can only get my initial screen with photo. I can't get page with on/off options (on duty / receive alerts etc)<br> :date: __2020-06-19 11:26:09__

> The app is decent enuff but there phone-in workers are ridiculous 🙄 rude to a point of where they lie to your face over and over and over and if u don't write all the info down on paper say goodbye to any refunds<br> :date: __2020-06-16 09:39:42__

> Well built app<br> :date: __2020-06-09 23:10:33__

> Not enough room to write in here what needs addressing as it's limited to 500 letters and spaces I'd barely touched the surface on what needs sorting and ran out of space, but there isn't enough information or user functionality in the app we need a lot more communication options in app with a more detailed description to assist with dealing with failed calls not being answered by the people that are in need plus a lot of other options and also an in app guidance and helpcentre<br> :date: __2020-12-10 11:08:18__

> Like others have said, I have an issue with the siren. I am a petsitter and it terrifies some of the cats I am visiting. I did ring and complain about this. I ended up turning it off the weeks. I have just turned it back on. Two alerts I accepted. First I keep ringing so dropped the job. Another had already arranged for someone to take him shopping. Now I have just got back the alert I dropped earlier and still no answer. The alerts are not reliable.<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:46:36__

> Good app but siren way too loud, it's driving my neighbour mad ! Apart from that, as others say here, 90% of people I ring have no idea why I rang, or how or why somebody put them on list. That needs addressing . On top of that some of the alerts are days old ,their prescription or shopping done days ago.Im becoming a bit disheartened wasting my time every day. I'm more than happy to run around for folks but less happy with wasted calls<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:11:24__

> Doesn't work. I try to register using my St John certificate and the swirl of doom just spins foreverrrrrrrr; by which I mean 20 minutes over WiFi. Was able to register via the Web then log in to the app. But app registration just did not work.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 22:19:48__

> I've responded a couple of times to find that the chat request was for the previous day and had been dealt with? Embarrassing and unnecessary and the siren is excruciating why not a special phone sound kinder on the ears<br> :date: __2020-11-03 13:24:23__

> The app is ok however this Sunday I received 6 requests in quick succession. All bar one needed no help, and most requests I get end up being no help needed. My main criticism of the app is that once an alert comes in it sets my notification volume to max. I don't want or need to be notified each time normal messages come in which is why it is set to mute. Please can you make sure the app doesn't change my notification settings<br> :date: __2020-10-09 21:17:20__

> I am getting alerts but am unable to accept or reject them, have reinstalled app as advised by volunteer helpline & this has made no difference.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 15:18:13__

> App works well, though it does not always record your time. Cannot make contact with any app designers to help resolve the problem. Tried a re-install but it didn't help.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 14:13:43__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2020-08-16 21:21:10__

> Worked perfectly before the update.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 18:58:39__

> Since recent update, siren won't play when simulating a test. Volume is up full, setting is active to play siren even on silent, all app permissions are same prior to update. Don't know if it will work if turnout is real?<br> :date: __2020-12-20 14:30:06__

> App is ok but no way to check back on previous messages. I responded to a call from a gentleman who needed shopping tomorrow. I agreed to do it and then toggled the app to show "responded" as soon as I've done that then previous messages dissappear and I now no longer have address or contact details to sort this out tomorrow!!<br> :date: __2020-11-28 18:00:32__

> My app ppears that it doesn't work I havent had any alerts, and I can't change my organisation<br> :date: __2020-11-25 21:44:29__

> Still unable to upload photos of new AEDs locations to the GoodSAM app. I've replied via email and awaiting your reply.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 23:07:53__

> Not contacted very often. Sometimes people dont need any help.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 09:37:32__

> The alerts work for a few weeks then the siren stop and I'm not notified of an alert. It just says in comma you missed an alert. So frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:27:38__

> Very poor for something so important. Clumsy, bad layout, adding an AED is broken. Come on, this app is IMPORTANT. Sort it out. (Reply to developer - Yes I have checked both of those settings and it still doesn't work. No reply to 4 emails requesting help either)<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:39:03__

> Only just come back to the app...but now i know why I deleted it! The siren is just too loud! I have to have my phone on silent now to stop it going off. I can understand why it was there during the apps initial use, for first responders calling to medical emergencies, but check in and chats or collecting groceries and prescriptions are hardly medical emergencies that need to be completed that precise minute. I cannot have my phone on silent constantly, so think I will have to delete it again...<br> :date: __2020-11-10 10:38:35__

> Goodsam can u explain as to WHY today their was a serious cardiac arrest which happened litrally 2mins from where i live....why wasnt the alarm raised and i could of potentially saved this old gents life,but because nobody knew were the nearest defibrillator was,by time ambulance etc got to him he had passed away...This absolutely breaks my heart because i could of saved this gent potential, but was not alerted.....its a disgrace really is....<br> :date: __2020-11-04 00:24:36__

> When volunteering in SE London I get a lot of requests which are 4-8miles away. This is too far in a city and unnecessary given the number of volunteers that must be available (e.g 15 within a few hundred yards of me). I therefore waste a lot of time with the siren continually blarring and rejecting 9 out of ten requests before accepting a request within a reasonable distance. It should be easy add a setting so that requests beyond a certain distance are not referred.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 17:04:53__

> Worked fine for quite some time and yet now, no requests are coming through and nobody knows why. Have reinstalled etc but no joy. Constantly failing, and no reasoning for it, have emailed you but no response, so I can't help people who need support.<br> :date: __2020-12-17 19:46:06__

> All this good will from the public is thrown away by an app that is next to useless. When alerted people have no idea why I'm phoning, their data doesn't match up with the message and the message is often hours/days old although the alarm has just sounded. What a waste of people's willingness to help in this crisis.<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:52:18__

> Bug in google play. Services<br> :date: __2020-12-08 19:41:19__

> I can't believe you can't adjust the volume on that siren, deleting it.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 01:04:08__

> I have received many alerts but was able to respind to only one as the alarm no longer works on my phone, although it does if I simulate it.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:58:20__

> I'm afraid I won't be using the app. The siren is, as the previous reviewer stated, ear splitting. I'll volunteer through a local organisation.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 00:30:41__

> Opens to register but thats as far as it goes, fill in my details and hit register and nothing happens, the little wheel just goes round and round<br> :date: __2020-11-01 19:45:27__

> Completely unusable. When you get an alert, there's absolutely no indication as to what you're supposed to do, and no way to contact the person needing help.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 18:32:29__

> I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location. I'm in London so I am sure there are people nearby that I could help but as is I am not seeing them. Please fix this!<br> :date: __2020-10-09 18:28:42__

The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an app to access precise location. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Public Health England Digital |
| **Website**  | [http://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10](http://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I'm finding it a brilliant motivator as I want to achieve and outstrip my goals each day and this is giving me the impetus to do so. I've been surprised that some of my structured daily exercise doesn't count, so it is also encouraging me to increase the effort I put into that. Well recommended.<br> :date: __2020-12-15 12:32:23__

> If you want some simple recipes it is a good free app.<br> :date: __2020-12-13 18:13:20__

> Works well.<br> :date: __2020-12-12 19:38:07__

> It says 'go for a third' when you're on your fourth. Is there a way of increasing your target beyond 30 minutes?<br> :date: __2020-12-11 11:26:10__

> Really useful but I do find if it is just in my pocket it doesn't always pick up brisk steps so I tend to hold my phone<br> :date: __2020-12-09 17:49:42__

> Use everyday. Find it a useful guide.<br> :date: __2020-12-08 13:57:48__

> I find this really useful and encouraging and would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that it occasionally stops working and you have to uninstall and reinstall it.<br> :date: __2020-12-05 04:19:31__

> App really helpful in terms of keeping up a good pace. Better than measuring steps. Simple and easy to use.<br> :date: __2020-12-04 21:02:14__

> This works well most days but some days doesn't record steps and brisk minutes you have done.<br> :date: __2020-12-02 18:49:02__

</p>

> Generally good and has motivated me to get a faster pace and do that for me time. Some irritations, however. I would like to set a (much) higher target but 30 mins a day is the maximum. Also, totals seem very slow to update at times and you have to close the app and open again. E.g. Its Sunday and yet my Saturday walk was still not reflected in the weekly figurea until I shut the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 23:42:05__

> I would like the app to dostep counter as well as distance and pace record<br> :date: __2020-11-25 14:34:13__

> Reach goals every day<br> :date: __2020-11-23 20:09:33__

> OK ish<br> :date: __2020-11-19 17:11:19__

> If you exceed your target the app doesn't recognise that and tells you 'keep going' for the target.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:42:09__

> Loads quicker than the earlier version, but otherwise inferior. Needs to allow more than 30 minutes as a target, also appears to under-record brisk walking.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:47:51__

> 9 November 2020: it works better than it used to, except I keep getting messages to update, I click the update button but the update doesn't happen. So annoying. Still, this app got me walking, and I've got healthier because of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 11:15:39__

> Active 10 just did an update and got rid of all my walks! Very annoying<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:23:04__

> Why does it ask, every time it starts, to get the latest updates, when it has the latest version?? It'll be removed if it continues to annoy me.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 10:02:55__

> It is a good, useful and simple tracker. I like the use of time. Would prefer if it allowed you to set higher targets but it's good enough for me. I gave it 4 stars when I left that review but for some reason it now asks to be updated every day!! I reinstalled it to try and stop this but it wiped all my data! So now downgrading to 3 stars.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 20:04:34__

</p>

> Far too often doesn't recognised I've walked at all.<br> :date: __2020-12-01 20:26:15__

> I was enjoying this app and it was great for getting you motivated about getting out and about. I have just clicked on it and it's not showing that I did any walking for the last 2 days!! I walk to work, so it should show. It was all there yesterday, but now nothing. Seems pointless using the app of it's going to delete what I've done, that's not very motivating..<br> :date: __2020-11-29 08:23:41__

> It does not work offline and i hate that<br> :date: __2020-11-17 08:29:56__

> App needs tweaking. Just walked for 25 mins app says 8 mins active that's all, not recorded the other 17 mins at all, I know phone senser is working as samsung health has recorded correctly. Also it can't add up,yesterday the daily "today" says I've done "32" mins of brisk walking then tells me I've NEARLY achieved 3 x10min awards, but it shows 3 gold cups. I also get fed up of it asking me to "update" everytime I open the app, if I choose "ok" there is clearly no new update<br> :date: __2020-11-13 12:01:01__

> I like the app, it's simple and tells me exactly what I need to know. But the latest version keeps prompting to update, very annoying!!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:04:35__

> Keeps telling me an update is available. As far as I can tell Ihave already downloaded it<br> :date: __2020-11-05 13:45:47__

> Very basic, but good enough. Been using for a year now and no major problems. A few extra features would make it more useful, but then I guess complexity could compromise the quality and reliability. UPDATE: New version is buggy. It keeps saying there is an update when I am on the latest.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 10:13:24__

> App does not give distance travelled, constantly reminds about an update but if you try to update your taken to the option to download same version as already installed. Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 23:50:09__

> Doesn't register cycling big disappointment,wants to update every time I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:45:49__

> Seems a bit hit and miss since upgrade, probably by Serco. 2 people did same walk and it registers 130 mins for 1 and 237 for the other ??!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 01:08:09__

> Doesn't work. Walk fast every day and it's still recorded nothing!!! a<br> :date: __2020-12-10 09:49:31__

> This is the third time I have installed this app, each time it has failed, locking up, not working. I'll try for the last time Correction this is the fourth and it has frozen YET AGAIN! Given up uninstall Ed. Tried the app again, vastly over reporting the time walking. Will uninstall again when will you get it right?<br> :date: __2020-12-09 12:23:50__

> Not very accurate! Came back to try the app with a new phone but it still underestimate the number of brisk minutes (in my opinion). I have to almost sprint for it to register and even then it's not very generous. It demotivates rather than encourages so I just make sure I do 30 mins of brisk walking and ignore the app!<br> :date: __2020-12-08 18:36:34__

> Not working properly, even when brisk walking, says no brisk walking, was OK, up until about 2 weeks ago.... now does not register steps correctly 🙄<br> :date: __2020-11-29 13:59:30__

> Not accurate<br> :date: __2020-11-28 23:02:54__

> Nov 2020 - decided to try app again but it crashed twice this past week and can't get any help from the developers. May 2020 - the app has again deleted all my data - which is even more upsetting given how much effort I've been making during lock down to move more. I'd give it 1/2 star now and will be looking for a new app. Previous review (Dec 2019) said the app is great but I no longer think so after my data being totally deleted.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 22:15:58__

> We are having real issues with this app. A 55 minute very brisk walk recently gave us only 6 minutes brisk walking and the following day showed nothing. Losing relevance rapidly!!<br> :date: __2020-11-27 10:45:56__

> Cannot get app to work. It seems to get into a loop when setting up at the fitness page. I press continue and get taken back to the beginning.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 11:49:01__

> I only have a 26inch leg so my strides are short, to get it to register as a brisk walk on this app i had to jog for the10min<br> :date: __2020-11-18 12:46:23__

> Previous version was very good and accurate. Walk the same route at the same speed. Previous version 20 minutes brisk new version 5 minutes brisk. Going to uninstall. It is a waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 20:57:41__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> 💚 Order repeat prescriptions to your door
<br>💚 Book GP appointments
<br>💚 View your GP medical record and carry it in your pocket
<br>💚 Discover your Wellness Score and get practical insights into your wellbeing
<br>💚 Build your most accurate health record
<br><b>NHS-ASSURED GP ONLINE SERVICES</b>
<br>Available at all GP practices in England:
<br>• Save yourself time by booking and cancelling GP appointments ⏰
<br>• Order your repeat prescriptions directly to your door, so you’re never without your medication 🚚 💊
<br>• Stay informed with 24/7 access to your GP medical record, including test results, immunisations, allergies and medications 📁
<br><b>ONE HEALTH RECORD. WHEN YOU NEED IT</b> 
<br>It may come as a surprise but a central record of your health doesn’t exist - your GP, hospital and other healthcare records aren’t joined up and information is not necessarily shared between them. That can make things pretty tricky, having to remember important information from memory, and explain past treatments and conditions over and over. With Evergreen Life, you can be in control and keep all your health data, including all of your GP records, in the palm of your hand - building a fully accurate and up-to-date record that you can carry with you all the time.
<br><b>WHAT’S YOUR WELLNESS SCORE?</b>
<br>Your Wellness Score can help you understand if you’re doing all you can to stay well. The score is based on your answers to the app’s clinically-researched Wellness Checks in areas such as fitness, happiness, sleep and diet. By discovering your Wellness Score, you’ll get personalised and practical insights into ways you can optimise your health and wellbeing.
<br><b>MEDICATION REMINDERS</b>
<br>Give yourself one less thing to worry about. Never forget to take your medications again with the Evergreen Life medicine app, helping you safely manage your own or your family’s health 💊
<br><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER</b>
<br>Track your health and fitness measurements, including blood pressure, body fat percentage and blood sugar levels, so you can monitor your health goals 🏋️‍♂️🤸‍♂️
<br><b>SECURELY STORE YOUR DOCUMENTS</b>
<br>If you struggle to find appointment letters or your health information is difficult to manage, storing all your documents in one app can make it much easier to organise your care 📩
<br><b>SHARE WITH THOSE WHO MATTER MOST</b>
<br>Get the best care possible and give peace-of-mind to your family or health providers with secure access to your shared health information.
<br> 
<br><b>DNA TESTING: UNLOCK YOUR HEALTH SECRETS</b> 🤫
<br>With Evergreen Life DNA testing, you can find out how your genes influence your:
<br>• DIET - Fuel your body with the nutrition it needs
<br>• METABOLISM - Understand what foods will help you feel healthiest
<br>• FITNESS - Achieve better fitness results, faster
<br>• SKIN - Personalise your beauty routine by what your skin needs
<br>Need a helping hand? 🖐️ If you want any help and support with using the app or getting set up with GP online services, head to https://help.evergreen-life.co.uk or call our Support Team at 0161 768 6063
<br><i>*Your local doctor’s surgery may not offer all GP online services. Ask your practice directly to find out which are available to you.</i>

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Useful!<br> :date: __2020-11-06 23:06:27__

> Update 07-04: Originally gave this app 5 stars then after an update, it didn't work, so reduced the rating. Since 7th April I have had no issues and it seems to be working fine. Just hope this continues. UPDATE 15 Oct: Have decided to use another app, although I have to say there were only a few problems. Trouble is I don't need problems. When you're ordering meds, you want it to be plain sailing and simple. I would tentatively recommend this app but it has to work without hiccups. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:01:41__

> I have been using same from almost the first week.off course when you first released the app it had one or two problems, then again which new release does not have problems.

> bio security does not work fingerprint works on all apart from this the most important one<br> :date: __2020-12-20 11:56:14__

> Was a good app to check, history, make appointments and order repeat prescription. But lately I can't log on keep saying password or login is incorrect. When I reset password it works from the email link. Also would be good if e-prescription pharmacy could be set when requesting prescription so you don't have to leave a message. If log in and prescription issue fixed would be happy to rate 5 star 😪<br> :date: __2020-12-18 01:11:37__

> sometimes when they make changes, you have to spend time searching for the prescription ordering tab,which should be the most prominent thing on the site, not on a sub page<br> :date: __2020-12-17 17:41:11__

> not as good as it could be ,why no way of uploading documents other than pictures and why not visible to members of the surgery by default?<br> :date: __2020-12-02 13:30:55__

> when I try to make an appointment it just says no appointments available — always. Prescription ordering works fine.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 18:28:27__

> not easy for seniors to use.<br> :date: __2020-11-29 17:46:23__

> Edit: this is working again now - but only on my old phone (which is too knackered to sell so ok). My new phone runs colorOS, (realme6), which might have something to do with it. Disney+ doesn't work on it because of this... Edit: I can't get to the bit where you order a precriotion. It just buffers endlessly. 4/5/2020 Works well for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 08:25:52__

> Prescription function issues when trying to order. Galaxy S10. Used to work fine, now all but useless to me.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 15:03:43__

> I will leave this rating as '2' as a warning to other potential users that there is an issue. ie that sometimes the App stops recognising your password and that, despite their best endeavours and lots of communications between us, Evergreen Life have not been able to resolve this issue. Hopefully one day they will get to the bottom of it as it is otherwise a pretty good App (and the Web access is good) but there are I know other similar Apps available that are probably worth looking at first.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 11:10:45__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus](http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
