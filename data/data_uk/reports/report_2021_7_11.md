The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage.

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

### Description

<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

My location is off permanently and at the start of the pandemic I did install the app and boom location automatically turned on .

> As people from other area's in the UK visit Scotland I don't believe the app syncs with other apps from other locations in the UK but only Scotland.

> Couldn't add my positive code to the app.<br> :date: __2021-03-22 01:02:01__

> Of questionable usability. Stay at home, and this app will still keep nagging you to switch on location - presumably the vision of the Covid hordes invading your dwelling makes spending battery power on satellite navigation worthwhile. Now, I remember The Omega Man from the first time around (1971 film), but did the designer of this really do so too? 🤔 I'd rather not be nagged at home to turn this on, thanks.<br> :date: __2021-03-19 19:13:23__

> Twice in three days I was contacted to isolate for 10 days despite never being in anyone's company inside or out within two meters I haven't even been near my own family. If passing someone on a pavement within seconds triggers the app for you to isolate then what's the point? They sell coffee at a door where people congregate on a pavement less than two meters to get past?<br> :date: __2021-03-13 10:03:34__

> When I first got the App I thought it was great to have it but now I am convinced it doesn't work giving people false confidence they've not been in contact with Covid, I have been in close contact with covid infected people yet never had notification. I think its flawed by requiring people to self input if they have it. Yet reading other reviews such as people in same household both entering details and none being informed that they've been in close contact?

> Very limited use for those us travel and work in England. Why can't Scottish politicians accept that Covid does not recognise borders.

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app.

I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:29:22__

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Health & Social Care Northern Ireland |
| **Website**  | [https://covid-19.hscni.net/contact-tracing/](https://covid-19.hscni.net/contact-tracing/) |
| **Email** | StopCOVIDNIApp@hscni.net |
| **Physical address**  | - |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices.

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

> Covid test question needs an 'unknown' option. I've been tested before, with negative result, but months ago, so saying my 'current status' is negative is misleading, but I can't say I've 'Never' been tested. Could also be used by those who've had a test, but awaiting results. There should be a definition of what 'current' means too. The question on whether you think you've had Covid needs a 'Maybe' option. I think I may have, but mildly & not the obvious symptoms so not confident to say 'Yes'.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:47:12__

> So, well, this app only gets your data: you send your talk, your cough, your data, and that's it. It gives you back nothing. You contribute to science. The problem here is: why don't they give me back the result of my data, based on the data they accumulated? This is not fair, no matter how much the data is valuable/correct. Just give me the output, even if just for curiosity. You state that the app is 98% correct. So there's no reason to be so shy. Also: this app would render the swab completely useless. Maybe the app doesn't give back the results so to not destroy the market of a perfectly useless device like the swab? I can see no other reason.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:10:40__

> The app asked me to complete the same survey every morning. I would have been happy to provide weekly responses, but found daily prompts too stressful given my very limited understanding of how this might help.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 18:27:29__

<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The NHS app is a great app, you can contact your GP to book apointments, see your covid pass, get health advice and it's easy to use. I give it 5 stars.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 23:26:44__

> I mostly use this for managing and ordering my prescriptions, but it works very well and has no bloat or ads. You can manage your organ donation declaration, and you can find your NHS number easily if you can't remember it.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 19:02:54__

> Downloaded the app, as you would expect to get hold if sensitive data you have to answer a few questions take a photo of I'd then a scan of your face and boom 2 hours later I'm verified and can see my vaccination history with a barcode for travel.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 14:53:37__

> Process very smooth and quick.... Nice app ...<br> :date: __2021-07-10 13:15:46__

> Good<br> :date: __2021-07-10 12:40:56__

> Easy to set up and use. Great to have my vaccination status easily displayed on-screen. But most importantly, I've just been pinged today and altho it's a nuisance to have to self-isolate for a few days this is a minor inconvenience considering the reassurance that I now have knowing that I'll be protecting 2 very vulnerable adults that I would normally visit regularly.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 01:16:21__

> Downloaded this barely half an hour ago. Very straightforward to get fully set up with ID and a facescan, linked with my GP surgery with my records, and of course current Covid vaccine status. I am genuinely impressed!<br> :date: __2021-07-09 20:24:56__

> Very good first impression. I was able to order repeat prescriptions through the app, without having to speak to my GP unnecessarily. Also very helpful to get a greater insight into my health records.<br> :date: __2021-07-09 17:52:50__

> Easy to use,my proof of vaccine letter was here in no time<br> :date: __2021-07-09 16:21:01__

> I find this app quite useful. My GP provides its own app for booking appointments and repeat prescriptions. Also I'm not able to use the repeat prescriptions on the NHS app. I think it would be a good idea if you had a way to show certificate status (hc2, hc3, prescription pre payment) via the app instead of having to show a physical letter.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 11:20:47__

> It took a while but I'm logged in now.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 16:14:40__

> It takes a bit of setting up, but it works and provides access to your UK NHS records.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 08:37:19__

> Easy to follow instructions and great information and advice<br> :date: __2021-07-08 06:51:22__

> Rubbish app, can't login after registration! Edit: This is now fixed for me!<br> :date: __2021-07-07 11:44:21__

> NO PHOTO ID REQUIRED Don't worry if you don't have photo ID, you can still use this app, contact your GP to get access codes, and follow the instructions, click on the underlined link above the choose which type of ID (I had the codes but couldn't find where to put them, thx to the app developer who pointed me in right direction)<br> :date: __2021-07-07 09:03:29__

> Decent and working app. But the covid pass barcode is not scanning with my fone or bar code scanner and just takes me to lots of gibberish numbers and letter. How can one prove the the bar code is authentic to any international authority while travelling internationally.<br> :date: __2021-07-10 23:05:16__

> Can any of the people behind the app cast any light on this, please? I'm unable to load my Covid pass. Instead, I see the message "You do not have an NHS COVID Pass", despite having had both jabs and subsequently returning a positive PCR test, before finishing self isolating. N.b. I'm seeing the same message online as well as through the app, so seems like a back end issue. I can't find anywhere to direct this query, and would really appreciate some help in resolving - thank you 🤞<br> :date: __2021-07-09 21:51:48__

> What a pain to install. Even after all the password stuff it still wanted me to record a video of me saying a number it gave me. Try as I may it wouldn't open my camera app so I got no further. I can't understand why my bank is happy with passwords but the NHS want password as well as a video of me. Typical government paid app that's over thought and over developed and trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Why can't you make do with passwords and texted verification code!<br> :date: __2021-07-07 20:12:01__

> Very hit & miss this app. Works intermittently but most of the time a "Unfortunately, NHS App has stopped" Can only download covid vaccine results for travel only. Found out recently from the developers (end of June) that it works on Android v8 & above (not sure about Apple OS). My phone is Android 6 which I can't upgrade. If you want people to use this app then you will have to make sure all versions will run it. This goes to for the NHS COVID-19 app as well. What a waste of time<br> :date: __2021-07-11 11:45:08__

> Unable to open camcorder to record video of me saying number. ID picture was taken fine, so not a permissions issue. Edit: Tried on a different phone, app won't even open.

> Complete rubbish Time and time again I've had to delete and reinstall and everytime It keeps saying I've 3 accounts and to use the first ones login. I don't have 3 accounts and I'm desperately trying to prove my covid vaccine status as I'm traveling alot. I've had to get it in paper form now. I've contacted yourselves who then tried to say my doctors has to reset it which is absolutely rubbish but looking at the star rating of your app I'm now sure it's nothing to with my doctors.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 04:04:52__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | SPOTTERON |
| **Website**  | [https://www.spotteron.net](https://www.spotteron.net) |
| **Email** | office@spotteron.net |
| **Physical address**  | [Faßziehergasse 5, 1070 Wien](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Faßziehergasse%205,%201070%20Wien) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> love it!!!<br> :date: __2021-07-03 06:37:18__

> Brilliant free app would be nice if it tracked how far you had ran/walk<br> :date: __2021-07-01 19:44:27__

> Liking the app and its helping. But the coach's voice volume doesn't always go above the music so can't always hear the instructions. Is there anything I can do to solve this?<br> :date: __2021-06-30 19:54:08__

> I love Jo Wiley coaching me ❤️❤️❤️<br> :date: __2021-06-30 18:00:32__

> I went from unmotivated and exhausted after 60 seconds jogging, to jogging for 30 minutes solid. I still don't enjoy 'running' and yet I got to the end of the challenge, so what more can you ask? Only complaint is the references to 5k throughout. It's 30 minutes. I can run 4k in that time and that's not exceptionally bad.<br> :date: __2021-06-29 08:42:28__

> I have found this app very helpful to get me started running. A friend recommended it and I am making a lot more progress than I had been, increasing my time running in a gradual way. There are links to YouTube videos with other running tips and stretches as well. It would help if the voice reminded you to do your stretches before starting the actual run and at the end too. It is shown in writing on the app, but once your phone is in your running belt, you don't see it!<br> :date: __2021-06-27 11:34:17__

> Highly recommended Crashed sometimes and run would reset sometimes but the program is extremely well done<br> :date: __2021-06-26 22:15:33__

> Working for me at 55 yes old<br> :date: __2021-06-26 13:23:01__

> It's easy to follow and did with a familiar voice. But annoying that the text is repeated on multiple runs on same week so can be confusing where you're up to.<br> :date: __2021-06-24 15:04:28__

> This app would be great if it didn't keep cutting out several times during your run! I have to add a seperate timer to keep track of how long I'm running for which isn't ideal. The advice & encouragement is helpful though and it's great to realise your progression as the weeks add up.<br> :date: __2021-06-11 09:38:58__

> Was great but now keeps shutting down towards the end of my run<br> :date: __2021-06-06 17:15:17__

> App has a glitch from week 4. The voice is out of sync with the timer which is really off putting and have to check the timer while running. If I open another app for example to change my music this app stops working and have to start the run again and skip to where I was. Not ideal while running. Would be a great app if it didn't have bugs. Finally completed the couch to 5k app, really helped me get fitness up<br> :date: __2021-06-02 21:33:32__

> Never thought I'd be running for these distances & times. Also never thought I'd enjoy running! App programme is excellent & having Michael Johnson egging me on helped haha. EDIT: lowered to 3 stars as you appear to have removed Michael Johnson.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:04:41__

> It does the job helping you keep track of your runs but it is annoying when you choose a trainer and it gives you error messages. If you go basic you cannot afford glitches!!<br> :date: __2021-05-29 15:26:33__

> Keeps crashing every minute and a half so I can't use it at all.<br> :date: __2021-05-26 13:53:53__

> Has only worked twice for me and that's after I deleted and reinstalled it several times and tried with different trainers. Very glitchy gets stuck after you press play. It is brilliant when it works. I have a Google pixel 3xl so going to try and find another app.<br> :date: __2021-07-03 14:12:00__

> Keeps turning off half way through the run.<br> :date: __2021-06-23 20:37:51__

> The voice of the coach is not in sync with my music from Spotify. Long periods of time where the coach isn't speaking and the volume dipped during this period. Conversley, the music is at full volume whilst the coach is speaking. This was from week one. Its quite distracting and would like it fixed, else is a good app.<br> :date: __2021-05-16 00:46:37__

> Brilliant idea, poor execution. The app is crashing, which results in resetting the day/run progress and second instance somehow running in background, still playing comments.<br> :date: __2021-05-13 14:11:52__

> Is there any settings to stop the app from not working when the phone screen is off?<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:30:31__

> This is an excellent programme that gets you running and in much better shape. I have completed the full programme twice now. The biggest flaw is that there is no follow-on plan. So after couch-to-5k I did 5k-to-couch! Update: reducing to 2 stars because regrettably the excellent trainer Michael Johnson is being removed. Update2: thank you for the reply. Please add a trainer like Michael who is minimalist and has gravitas.<br> :date: __2021-04-23 12:00:39__

> Can confirm on my Pixel 3 phone runs will only work when Lice Captioning is on. Timer won't count down so cant do runs without it on. Strange Even after recent update. Still doing it<br> :date: __2021-04-21 16:40:03__

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.
<br>For more information please visit our website at www.protegoapp.org

> Based on tracking only (haven't used it for sending) and address checks (one is allowed 50). 4 * because lately the reference number for 2nd class parcels and some 48 hour tracked mail (which used to give very limited data) no longer give any data (yes, this is more of a Royal Mail system problem than an app-specific problem).<br> :date: __2021-06-27 10:18:18__

> Already had a Royal Mail account from having bought stamps some years back and so it was fairly easy installing and setting up. setting up a redelivery was fairly easy and a tracking number in a text message opens seamlessly in the app. Great thus far.<br> :date: __2021-07-11 10:27:47__

> quite buggy at times<br> :date: __2021-07-06 13:17:00__

> Logs me out almost every time which is frustrating, on a few occasions transactions have failed yet I still got charged for postage. No email confirmations or anything. It is easy to use and navigate through but its somewhat buggy and needs a bit more stability in regards to making payments and logging in.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 01:56:41__

> Simple and straight forward, however having to manually add your sending address for every parcel is more hassle than it should be<br> :date: __2021-06-30 13:13:38__

> I don't know what is going on with this app,is give me this message.... the session expired..please login again,if you are not use the royal mail app for a while, everything else is working without any problems,please sort out this problem,thank you<br> :date: __2021-06-28 23:31:36__

> OK, but not live tracking like many other delivery companies.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 09:58:56__

> It's a shame they don't read instructions on where to deliver your parcel if you are not at home<br> :date: __2021-06-03 10:27:49__

> App is useful. However, I wish that you could delete parcels at any time, even if it hasn't been delivered yet.<br> :date: __2021-06-02 20:12:17__

> Very poor app I have had parcels delivered but the app says sorry we have no information on this delivery try again tomorrow? I've also tried tracking a new delivery only to get the same message I've used this app for a very long time now but since the latest update everything has gone down hill. What good is a tracking app that doesn't track.<br> :date: __2021-06-28 11:59:08__

> Slow<br> :date: __2021-06-17 15:34:16__

> Trying to re book a delivery and when you have to confirm at the end all I get is an error message. The app is rubbish it doesn't work<br> :date: __2021-06-12 12:11:28__

### Description
> The City of Corona app provides simple methods for the community residents to engage and be part of this wonderful community. It provides ways to pay bills, sign up for recreation activities, call departments with one click, as well as Live Video feeds from many traffic cameras throughout the city.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.

> I'm updating my review as all seems to have settled down now, although it took a while. I'm getting more and more tasks now, so it shows how much people need the support. I'm more than happy to be a volunteer, and I get as much out of it as the people I'm ringing and checking up on!<br> :date: __2021-06-18 21:15:25__

> As a GoodSAM 'verified responder' (St John Ambulance), the Responder app has been an amazing community tool for assisting East Midlands Ambulance Service with cardiac arrests and other similar incidents. Ambulance crews have all been happy for assistance during these calls. - Working together, this is a lifesaving app. I did notice that prior to being a verified responder for St John that if you just have a first aid certificate, it's very unlikely that you'll get a call out, but this is down to the policy of your local ambulance provider and not the app.<br> :date: __2021-06-05 12:26:07__

> Don't get me wrong here, I use this app to volunteer to assist in vaccination shifts. However lately, you have vaccination centres and pharmacists located in the same area when your volunteering to do these shifts. Wouldn't it have been a better idea to have one area for centres and a separate one for pharmacists. Having all of them in the same area, not only makes this app confusing.

### Description
> Campus is the Airbus app that helps you quickly locate where you are and what is around you whilst visiting an Airbus site. The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> Active 10 is a free and easy to use walking app that tracks your walking and shows you how you can increase your intensity to benefit your health. The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress
<br>* Store and view up to 12 months of your walking activity, to see how far you have come 
<br>* Discover loads of hints and tips on achieving a healthier lifestyle
<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Not yet used Sent me<br> :date: __2021-06-22 17:00:51__

> Straightforward to use Good to be able to look back at previous activity<br> :date: __2021-06-19 20:26:34__

> Good for basic activity information. You know when you need to be more active.<br> :date: __2021-06-19 15:15:30__

> Pity there isn't a place to list sekf-isolating or recent operations!!<br> :date: __2021-06-18 12:02:43__

> Loved using this to track my walking. Had 6 months or so before it's stopped working.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 12:44:40__

> Very easy to use. Surprisingly motivational<br> :date: __2021-06-14 12:21:58__

> Very easy to use app. Would be lovely if app covered cycling too<br> :date: __2021-06-09 15:06:33__

> It's a good app but it doesn't always refresh so I'm not surexwhstcI have completed, sometimes it calculates on the wrong day, that said when it works its great<br> :date: __2021-06-08 21:39:07__

> It's a friendly app, nudging you now and again to step up and get your heart going. It needs something though, I can't put my finger on it but it definitely needs an extra whatever to really motivate you.<br> :date: __2021-06-07 08:20:55__

> Shows the total length of my walk and how many 10 minutes worth were 'brisk' which counts towards getting a reward, shows 'hat tricks' for 3 x 10 minutes in a day, 100 - 3000 club shows you ow many minutes from the day you downloaded the app, you get a high five for how many days in 7 you have taken a brisk walk. It's helping me see how much I do or don't move in a day and for me I've got start somewhere.<br> :date: __2021-06-01 12:58:17__

> At the moment the app is making me go through set up every time I open it up. It still remembers my walk history, but it's quite annoying having to set up the permissions every time<br> :date: __2021-07-11 00:41:59__

> Disappointed with latest update...it goes through the set up every single time I use it. I've using this for several years and it keeps me motivated to do my daily power walk but fed up it goes through the set up questions every time! Using an android OnePlus5T<br> :date: __2021-07-01 18:57:14__

> Loads quicker than the earlier version, but otherwise inferior. Needs to allow more than 30 minutes as a target, also appears to under-record brisk walking. Since then it's got worse, seriously under recording active walking. And why does it demand an internet connection?<br> :date: __2021-06-26 01:41:52__

> Would like it if it linked to android or apple devices when not wanting to take your phone out for a walk<br> :date: __2021-06-25 00:13:14__

> Really surprised there is no settings to account for I'll be pushing a pram!!! Breathlessness will happen at slower speed.<br> :date: __2021-06-14 01:14:58__

> Generally good but does not accurately record walking times, always less than I have actually done which is annoying.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 10:41:15__

> It stopped working<br> :date: __2021-06-04 13:57:28__

> Brisk walk is debatable. Sometimes you almost need to run to clock up minutes. I walk on the flat as going up hill is slower and does not register brisk minutes. I do like the rewards as trophies and these are a good motivator.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 17:39:05__

> Doing the same circuit in the same time (30 minutes) gives different minutes of brisk walks eg from 30 mins down to 22. That's the same distance in the same time give or take 20 seconds. Forces you to adopt an unhealthy posture in order to walk fast enough to register a brisk walk.<br> :date: __2021-05-30 01:28:05__

> No baseline assessment to measure whst is "brisk" for me. Makes you feel good when you notch up a chunk of brisk minutes, motivating to make me reach the next 10.<br> :date: __2021-05-03 11:17:55__

> Moved app to a new phone and it goes through the set up questions every time I open it. It also seems to under report Active steps. The old app on my old phone worked so well. Such a shame.<br> :date: __2021-07-08 00:42:00__

> Was a good app, but since the update it does not always register the walks and walks randomly go missing. Think it is time to ditch the app and look for something else.<br> :date: __2021-07-02 15:09:48__

> Doesn't seem to track your movements fully or it looses data? Shame...<br> :date: __2021-06-27 19:17:21__

> Today it has stopped registering any walks. I have the latest version, and it's been fine until today.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 20:58:08__

> Worked very well with iPhone 6S, since installed on a new HONOR 20 Lite - it never registers brisk walk and walking the same route which takes about an hour sometimes states less than fifteen minutes normal walking. Reinstalled and booted three times no different. Very disappointed! UPDATE 11.06.21 I've reinstalled three times, does not register brisk walks. Works well on WileyFox phone, but problems with Honor 20 lite. So disappointed!<br> :date: __2021-06-11 09:28:01__

> It's ok<br> :date: __2021-05-30 15:42:56__

> The app counts cycling as walking... It's just not right. Hope it get fixed. Only useful for brisk, not hfor normal walk.<br> :date: __2021-05-25 16:49:12__

> It does not register brisk walking properly. I walk with my daughter both using active 10, mine shows very little brisk walking compared with hers. Rubbish.<br> :date: __2021-05-15 15:25:57__

> Doesn't always work<br> :date: __2021-05-10 20:48:27__

> Stopped tracking. Worked well 1st week but now doesn't track my walking at all. Annoying as I walk for an hour and half each day and am interested in seeing how I'm doing<br> :date: __2021-04-26 10:47:44__

> Keeps needing to be setup everytime I use it. Have now uninstalled it. It used to be good.<br> :date: __2021-07-01 21:55:08__

> Terrible worked the first 2 walks I did then nothing. Really disappointed won't be using it again<br> :date: __2021-06-26 18:49:51__

> Slow to load, slow to start up, misses many brisk walks. Good in concept but poorly implemented. Stopped using it.<br> :date: __2021-06-24 17:35:35__

> Doesn't work. Simple as that. What more can I say?<br> :date: __2021-06-24 16:53:02__

> Had a glitch after first few weeks when first downloaded but had been working really well since and it's an app I find really useful. Recently though (since last update) every time I open it I have to go through the whole set up including consents (including a prepopulated decision that I want to set my own goals, I don't). Every. Single. Tme. Held off deleting in hope bug would be fixed but I really can't be bothered with the hassle anymore so will be deleting after this post.<br> :date: __2021-06-24 11:46:13__

> Great overall though tracking distance covered would be good too. Since lost most of my data so now unimpressed by the app. Now it's asking me to agree to terms and conditions everytime I use it! Why?<br> :date: __2021-06-20 11:17:42__

> I loved this app when I first started using it, as it was an easy way to keep track of my progress, but like others, I'm finding that it keeps stripping out all of my stats, so starting to think I'll not bother using it anymore unless a fix is done very soon - such a shame I tried using the app again recently and it appears to have stopped working completely now, so not tracking any minutes at all, app needs updating!! App updated on 14.06.21 & it's still not working properly, disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-06-15 08:20:28__

> This app was great from January till May, and then it stopped tracking my minutes of brisk walking. Needs fixing big time..<br> :date: __2021-06-07 21:31:27__

> Hopeless. Doesn't record minutes of walking accurately let alone minutes of brisk walking. Today I walked briskly for 30 minutes but only 24 minutes of walking was recorded and just 8 were recorded as "brisk". So I practically ran for 5 minutes, then walked briskly for another 5, to try and push the brisk minutes up. No additional minutes of walking, brisk or otherwise were recorded. It stuck at 24 and 8. It was fine for a couple of days but hasn't recorded accurately since then.<br> :date: __2021-05-09 18:22:31__

> Didn't find this app useful because what I felt was a brisk walk for me didn't register leaving me feeling disheartened. ☹️<br> :date: __2021-04-29 19:09:50__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Innovatise GmbH |
| **Website**  | [http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure](http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure) |
| **Email** | leisuremembership@rctcbc.gov.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Fuller and Forbes Healthare |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bramleyonline.co.uk](http://www.bramleyonline.co.uk) |
| **Email** | bramley.village@nhs.net |
| **Physical address**  | [Fuller and Forbes Healthcare Bramley Village Health and Wellbeing Centre Highfield Road Bramley Leeds LS13 2BL](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Fuller%20and%20Forbes%20Healthcare%20Bramley%20Village%20Health%20and%20Wellbeing%20Centre%20Highfield%20Road%20Bramley%20Leeds%20LS13%202BL) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Can be glitchy. Biometric login often doesn't work.<br> :date: __2021-05-18 15:06:02__

> Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery.

> Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.<br> :date: __2021-03-21 11:53:58__

> Clunky and issues with passwords/refreshing. If the appointment you selected is taken, the system makes you confirm your password before you can attempt to book another. Causing you to miss out on other appointments. You always need to refresh twice before your results are actually updated. Aware these are just two functions but they are only ones I use. And being able to manage your health care is the point of the app.<br> :date: __2021-07-07 09:09:57__

> Frustrating and going round in circles. Being told my email is invalid (total nonsense) and being sent numbers to my mobile then means starting to register all over again.

I shall not bother again.login is a nightmare.<br> :date: __2021-06-08 17:36:26__

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience.

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
