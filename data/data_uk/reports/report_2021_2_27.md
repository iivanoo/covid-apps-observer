The details of our analysis are presented in the remainder of this report.

For independent verification, the raw data and the source code of the project is publicly available in its GitHub repository [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer) and its source code has been thoroughly commented in order to provide all the details about how the information provided in this report has been extracted. 

Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.

<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

> Could do with more updates. But pretty good for sign posting<br> :date: __2020-06-29 12:39:16__

> Quite good app as has a symptoms checker and some info, advice and statistics.. However doesn't have what I actually downloaded it for which was to find out about updates to current regulations and recovery plan such as easing of lockdown rules etc.. Have to search for this and then visit nidirect website for this info..<br> :date: __2020-06-07 21:55:20__

> Good app<br> :date: __2020-05-06 23:22:23__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The NHS COVID-19 app is the official contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>Check-in: Use our simple QR code scanner to check-in to venues like bars and restaurants. You will get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus.
<br>Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.
<br>The app can be used across UK borders in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting all relevant contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), alerting them if they have been in contact with coronavirus. 
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Poor compared to the apple version. My sister got told by her app to self-isolate, yet despite this mine was as normal the whole time (I did self-isolate due to being in the same house though). No notifications or even a change on screen telling me too when opening the app. Hers also tells her every week whether or not she has any possible contacts and gave her an urgent notification telling her to self-isolate.

My three sons families do not use the app. They tell me it doesn't work. You need a Basic Test icon that does some basic simple checking and gives reassurance that it's working Currently there is NO feedback to the user whatever ! How can I sell that?

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

> I received a notification to self-isolate back in November. When I checked the periods of exposure on the Google notification page there had been no exposure checks for several days including the day I was allegedly exposed. It turned out I was nowhere near anybody that had corvid-19. My next door neighbour had tested positive a week or so before. The Bluetooth picked up the notification through the wall.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 14:22:32__

> An ok app but my husband and I both tested positive on the same day. The following day, we each received a text to say we'd been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. Given we live in the same house ...<br> :date: __2021-01-20 18:16:11__

> Nice if there was a log of when it was working and when instead of praying that a notification comes up if you've been exposed.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 18:32:20__

> Update: appear to be getting daily exposure updates now. Will give the app another try. I have had zero response from the developer.<br> :date: __2021-01-09 00:16:58__

> The app used to work fine until the 10 Dec update but then stopped checking for exposures automatically. It was difficult to report the issue --- it feels like mails / app reviews only got attention after people made fuss on social media. The app works OK now, after the 5 Jan update, but I wish there was an easier way to report bugs, and more transparency regarding existing ones.<br> :date: __2021-01-08 13:18:19__

> Gave me a notification saying I had been in contact with someone with covid and had to self isolate....10 days AFTER I had been in contact with them and I only had to isolate for 1 day?? Not convinced it works or it is very slow to update you.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:05:01__

> When I first got the App I thought it was great to have it but now I am convinced it doesn't work giving people false confidence they've not been in contact with Covid, I have been in close contact with covid infected people yet never had notification. I think its flawed by requiring people to self input if they have it. Yet reading other reviews such as people in same household both entering details and none being informed that they've been in close contact? Raises suspension app authenticity<br> :date: __2021-02-14 10:44:35__

> I was quite naive and feeling safe because I hwe receuved zero contact alerts, so was blissfully confident that I was OK. Until today that is, when I discovered that a) there was an update that was not automatically applied, b) there are so many criticisms of the app and c) so many complaint communucations to the developer remain unanswered.... Is the app a complete con? Is it just to calm the naive and stupid like me. I had not encountered any issues, but then I didn't expect to.. I was safe???<br> :date: __2021-02-14 01:07:48__

> There is no way of knowing if it iseven working. Updates saying everything is fine you haven't been in contact with a positive person would be nice.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 13:30:55__

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Government of Jersey |
| **Website**  | [http://covidalert.gov.je](http://covidalert.gov.je) |
| **Email** | covidalert@gov.je |
| **Physical address**  | [Digital Health, 4 Edward Place, The Parade, St. Helier, Jersey JE2 3QP](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Digital%20Health,%204%20Edward%20Place,%20The%20Parade,%20St.%20Helier,%20Jersey%20JE2%203QP) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=5014249503765258721](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=5014249503765258721) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks. 
 **android.permission<br>BLUETOOTH** | Normal | Allows applications to connect to paired bluetooth devices. 
 **android.permission<br>FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | Normal | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground.

> Personally I think the Channel Islands as a whole should use a combined system instead of separatist nature. I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:29:22__

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

> This app only checks exposure if it comes within a short distance of someone else who has the app. No exposure checks mean you havent been close enough to someone for it to check.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:06:28__

> QUERY! If having to move devices, how are you supposed to transfer the existing exposure checks from the previous 14 days to the new device, in case any of those report a positive case?<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:39:02__

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you.

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Excellent<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:31:20__

> This app gives local and national updates, rates of infection and positive cases. I haven't used everything on it but once I have my vaccination tomorrow that will potentially open more information relevant to me. You can use the app just for yourself or add others such as family or elderly neighbours who aren't tech savvy (not that you need to be for this).takes few seconds daily, tap on info already held,if it hasn't changed,or alter,easy to update if needed.Excellent app,hassle free.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 10:24:24__

> Glad to be taking part<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:55:21__

> Only choices are "I've never had a covid test" or "add new test" Have tried to add my Imperial college survey test, but end up in a bit of a circular loop, so abandoned. Each time I log in, I'm presented with same choice so have been choosing "I've never had a test" ...which of course, isn't the case<br> :date: __2021-02-26 11:55:06__

> A bit confusing at first, it was not obvious which buttons to press, particularly the first time I had to report back. There's too much on screen in my opinion. Once you know, it's easy enough.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:49:23__

> It's not intuitive, sometimes confusing especially between what's the page for vaccine symptoms and daily health.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 12:48:09__

> Disappointed with wildly varying statistics creating a lack of trust in software<br> :date: __2021-02-21 11:46:37__

> Site sticks occasionally and leaves you hanging in the air. Doesn't offer a ' no change' tickbox.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:13:38__

> Its fine, but I would like to be able to specifically say about how I feel after the vaccine. I am feeling nauseous, but only because I had the vaccine earlier today, and I have had to say that on a section which I believe relates to Covid symptoms.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 18:11:49__

> Initially worked really well with a daily reminder to report but the reminder has stopped working since one of the updates. Otherwise it's really easy to use and has a lot of information on the study, symptoms, developments re vaccines that's useful and interesting.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 23:40:20__

> Nice and well developped Covid-19 tracker app. The exposure map in regard with the region is very useful, although it cannot be zoomed in too much and it's difficult to select adjacent regions. Update: Initial Area Map is not updated as it seems, giving false current estimates (for long). UK map displays totally different estimates per area and should be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 22:39:51__

> Please reassure me that my data is actually being recorded. The app says I haven't entered any for 4 days. That simply isn't the case. I have missed a day as I forgot to charge my phone, but I entered data Yesterday afternoon. This inaccuracy has been there from the beginning. I want to be sure it is worthwhile continuing. Have you even seen this? Why don't you respond to my numerous contacts about this? I entered yesterday. The app says 5 days.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 12:17:00__

> Doesn't appear to work. It asks you to report symptoms even if well but the 2 drop down questions are both not applicable and you cannot proceed further.

> The app is making a massive contribution to the fight against Covid-19, and on a day-to-day basis it works fine. The downside is that it breaks when it's updated. After the last three updates I've either been unable to login (despite getting a password reset), or the daily notifications have stopped. In all cases the only fix was to uninstall the updated app and reinstall from scratch. The update process needs more testing before new versions are released otherwise users will give up.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 15:06:18__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

> Covid test question needs an 'unknown' option. I've been tested before, with negative result, but months ago, so saying my 'current status' is negative is misleading, but I can't say I've 'Never' been tested. Could also be used by those who've had a test, but awaiting results. There should be a definition of what 'current' means too. The question on whether you think you've had Covid needs a 'Maybe' option. I think I may have, but mildly & not the obvious symptoms so not confident to say 'Yes'.<br> :date: __2021-01-13 02:47:12__

> So, well, this app only gets your data: you send your talk, your cough, your data, and that's it. It gives you back nothing. You contribute to science. The problem here is: why don't they give me back the result of my data, based on the data they accumulated? This is not fair, no matter how much the data is valuable/correct. Just give me the output, even if just for curiosity. You state that the app is 98% correct. So there's no reason to be so shy. Also: this app would render the swab completely useless. Maybe the app doesn't give back the results so to not destroy the market of a perfectly useless device like the swab? I can see no other reason.<br> :date: __2020-12-31 18:10:40__

> The app asked me to complete the same survey every morning. I would have been happy to provide weekly responses, but found daily prompts too stressful given my very limited understanding of how this might help.<br> :date: __2020-11-27 18:27:29__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Installation and verification of identity were fairly straightforward. Verification of identity involved several steps and was quite convoluted but it all followed through and was logical. I am reassured that such rigorous steps are required to access such sensitive personal data. I have yet to make substantial use of the app so I can't comment on that yet.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 19:17:41__

> Works for me. Has all my record's up to date.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 11:12:27__

> Been using this NHS app for a long time. Great for booking appointments and ordering repeat prescriptions. I've not had any of the problems other users have mentioned. With more features and refinement this will be a 5 star app IMHO.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 10:22:32__

I can also see if a meds request has been actioned and see my appointment history ...

> The back button should return to the previous page rather than prompt to log you out on any screen you press it. Would also be nice if it used the Android 10 biometric API, to allow other login types than just finger print.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 16:46:25__

> It's got better, but still run by people who REALLY don't understand CUSTOMERS.

> Tricky to register on this if you are a non-driver without a current passport (and who needs to renew a passport in a lockdown?). I've yet to make this work. I was discouraged by this and abandoned a previous attempt, but still pressing on for now this time. And, incidentally, though I can download this to my tablet, the Covid NHS one is incompatible. The benefits to all in better accessibility must be obvious, surely? Way to go with improving the reliability of your statistics!<br> :date: __2021-02-20 00:45:31__

> Tried to update the app and it won't work. Uninstalled the original to start again and that won't load. Is there a problem I a ready had the app on my phone and have been using it satisfactorily for months. It was only when I was asked to update it and it wouldn't let me use it until I did, that I had problems with it. My phone is up to date and has plenty of storage and memory. It is the app which has the problem. It was fine until the update.<br> :date: __2021-02-12 02:53:10__

> Not the best app I've ever attempted to use, insists on telling me there's a problem with my connection, strangely everything else on my phone works! Of course UK gov can't be their fault now can it. Could be a very good app with a bit of knowledgeable input<br> :date: __2021-02-09 14:18:03__

> The log in took over four hours to complete. It will not load on my laptop. Once everything is up loaded on to a smart phone. you log in to check perscriptions all you get is an error message. I still do not know if they have been ordered and they have just ran out, so now still have to ring to find out. the phone charges are now over forty pounds. A complete waste of time and money !!!!!!!! I now have no error messages so all is working at the moment, fingers crossed up the star rating .<br> :date: __2021-02-03 16:12:08__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | SPOTTERON |
| **Website**  | [https://www.spotteron.net](https://www.spotteron.net) |
| **Email** | office@spotteron.net |
| **Physical address**  | [Faßziehergasse 5, 1070 Wien](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Faßziehergasse%205,%201070%20Wien) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=6074809323558115618) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great,easy to follow<br> :date: __2021-02-26 12:12:05__

> As user friendly as a running app can get. It is informative for when you are starting out, and tries to keep you motivated with lots of positive encouragement. The addition of celebrities as coaches was a welcome addition. Not 5 stars as all of the coaches go through the same script, and some of the useful advice seems to be hidden behind different weeks. Overall though, very good, would recommend.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 18:57:47__

> Brilliant app.motivayes and inspires, I am.not a runner at all however this allows you to build up your stamina slowly. My only irk is that I cannot hear the trainer<br> :date: __2021-02-24 23:06:15__

> Keeping me motivated<br> :date: __2021-02-24 21:03:01__

> Love having a structure and goals to work to. Would like each day to have a different commentary rather than the same one all week. I think it should recommended that you should be able to do a brisk walk for 40 minutes before you start week 1. If you are seriously unfit it's quite a lot of running.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 20:00:32__

> I find this app a bit 'basic' so good if you dont want it personalised and just want something to keep time while you run. I also find I have error messages frequently and have to keep changing coach voice.<br> :date: __2021-02-27 11:54:07__

> Wd have liked to see distance covered in time spent<br> :date: __2021-02-25 15:27:15__

> Overall a nice app, the podcasts are positive and concise and the goals are manageable for a beginner at running. There are some irritating issues though, mainly involving it sometimes failing to cue up - sometimes I just find myself running and running, knowing full well I've run for well over the full amount of time but not having been told to stop yet. Sometimes the podcast runs perfectly in the background but sometimes it fails randomly, despite all my phone settings seeming to be correct.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 01:10:54__

> Good workout, however it doesn't tell me when my cool down walk is finished or save my progress at the end of each run<br> :date: __2021-02-22 15:02:22__

> Good exercise program, got me up and running. App constantly crashes recently, not sure if there's compatibility issues with Strava but it hasn't worked properly for the last couple of months<br> :date: __2021-02-20 21:34:54__

> Really helped me go from not being able to run at all to going over 7k by week 8. I'm not ever going to be a runner but I feel fitter. It was really annoying that you couldn't always select the presenter you wanted. Also if the phone rang then the app stopped working, and I didn't realise so had to start again!<br> :date: __2021-02-20 18:01:28__

> Sometimes difficult to hear trainer over music. Regularly have to change trainer due to issues<br> :date: __2021-02-19 21:19:59__

> V V easy to use. Running time is irrelevant, as distance covered depends upon pace....? But its perfect for motivation! Recommend it, yep!<br> :date: __2021-02-16 22:16:29__

> Great app when it works. I frequently have to reboot the app multiple times before the audio etc actually comes through.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:10:45__

> Somehow, I managed to have 4 copies going at the same time, out of sync. There was no way to stop them. It shouldn't be possible to start it while a copy is running.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 13:00:41__

> I'm sad to give this such a low review. Because if it worked properly it would easily be the best app available for this. Unfortunately no matter what I do or how I alter the settings as soon as the screen is locked and the phone is in my pocket this app stops working. It requires my phone screen to be unlocked and the app to be open in order to work and that simply isnt compatible with running. I hope they fix it because as I said if it's working properly its way above all other alternatives.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 13:19:25__

> Good at first and helped me get running but the app was constantly crashing. Ended up using the plan but not the app.<br> :date: __2021-02-15 21:14:57__

> Keeps crashing mid-run. Incredibly irritating.<br> :date: __2021-02-11 07:47:58__

> In my previous review I gave it a 3 or 4 stars, but now at the end of Week 3 I'm ready to switch to another App. The problem is that it keeps closing whilst I'm running, so I'm not actually running or walking for the time it says to. About the only time I found it didn't close was the first couple of runs when I held the phone in my hand. This latest run, I switched it to Flight to mode to try and avoid notifications confusing it and switched off some of the easy open settings! No good.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 09:48:59__

> It's a great concept and I enjoy using it for the most part but I am sick and tired of the app crashing mid run. Edit - 8/2/21 still crashes mid run. Absolutely useless!<br> :date: __2021-02-08 19:00:46__

> Got the app last weekend been out on 2 runs inbetween gym sessions and on both runs the app has just stopped!<br> :date: __2021-02-07 20:28:50__

> The running schedule is great and I'm really enjoying it. Michael Johnson's audio is motivational without being cheesey. I have an Honor phone so the app shuts down part way through a run, apparently there's nothing the developers can do about this. I have downloaded a free interval timer that does the job and runs successfully in the background without issue, and just use the Couch to 5k app for the schedule and to log my runs.<br> :date: __2021-02-07 17:33:40__

### Description
> The Ministry of AYUSH presents the “Ayush Sanjivani” mobile application for understanding the measures adopted by public for enhancing immunity and keeping themselves healthy in the difficult COVID-19 situation. The app is designed as a simple but effective mechanism of electronic documentation for studying population behaviour. Response of the public to the advisories issued by the AYUSH Ministry on immunity enhancement will be an important area of examination. In addition, provision is also made for recording other measures (if any) propagated by AYUSH practitioners and adopted by general public for immunity enhancement and disease prevention. Data collected through this app will be analyzed to find out usage of AYUSH interventions and its efficacy in maintaining health by enhancing immunity.
<br>This app is at the centre of a massive exercise to study specific health seeking behaviours of the public in which the Central Research Councils of AYUSH, the National Institutes of AYUSH, numerous AYUSH educational institutions and state governments bodies collaborate. The Ministry has a target sample size of 1 million people for this study, making it one of the largest in any discipline of medicine. All those who volunteer to furnish information through this app will be making a significant contribution to the study of public health in the country.
<br>Data collected will be analyzed and will be useful for the AYUSH systems, and will establish their viability as health-assuring practices globally. This would also add momentum to the growth of the AYUSH Sector.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.

> I use primarily for tracking incoming and outgoing parcels. Cannot edit description when inputting data which leaves me with columns of meaningless numbers until I am eventually allowed to manually edit once RM have clocked the item in system which is very slow and tedious. Unedited numbers are also duplicated in list and shuffled around making even more work! And whatever happened to push notifications?

### Description
> The City of Corona app provides simple methods for the community residents to engage and be part of this wonderful community. It provides ways to pay bills, sign up for recreation activities, call departments with one click, as well as Live Video feeds from many traffic cameras throughout the city. Through GPS maps, users of the app will be able to find their way to many official City offices, parks, and other locations. When looking for something to do, a calendar has events with the ability to have push notifications with instant alerts on crime, traffic, events, and more.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on "duty" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four "shouts" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a "chat.

> I just updated as there should be a new task tab for vaccination steward volunteers. I see nothing different<br> :date: __2021-01-14 18:39:42__

> Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a "double ding" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the "accept" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the "bypass silent" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one "ding" now as expected - thnx!<br> :date: __2021-01-13 12:48:32__

> Update: issue now fixed with a distance slider on the 'me' tab, the app now works fine. ----- I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.<br> :date: __2021-01-11 18:50:43__

> Early experience so far is fine. Though when I select 'find a route' in simulation mode Uber opens rather than Google maps. Any ideas on how to correct this?<br> :date: __2021-01-06 19:02:09__

> This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications.

> As a volunteer, can I request an option that allows volunteers to log in the app that someone isn't picking up their phone despite 3 attempts by 3 other responders? I can see i'm the 4th responder. It would be useful to have a 'tried to contact but no response' action without having to call the 0800 number each time.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 17:50:15__

> 1. I uninstalled the Goodsam app from my Android v10 tablet as the Task tab didn't show like on the smartphone. I was planning to reinstall to fix this bug. Now it says my tablet isn't compatible. WHY!!? It seems perverse to withdraw the tablet version. It was useful if my wife borrowed the phone. 2. I am signed up as a stewarding volunteer. It would help if you could add an alert when a task comes in. This could be the siren already in place. But as the "tasks" are less urgent an email would suffice.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 20:16:22__

> Buggy, clunky UI. Clicking on 'Show details' of a booked task closes the app every time. The details can only be seen by restarting the app. No way to go back to the homepage without clicking back through every page of the 'tasks' section. Can't copy text, eg task addresses.

> Completely ineffective,I haven't had a single alert since I downloaded the app. No tasks have shown up either. I have logged out, uninstalled the app, reinstalled it and logged back in but still nothing. What is the point of volunteering if the app doesn't work properly. Really frustrated! GoodSAM LTD Thanks for your reply.I'm not asking you to generate an alert just for me, simply stating my experience.The one time when tasks appeared the app wouldn't allow me to accept so somethings not right<br> :date: __2021-02-27 00:44:01__

> Never had any notification since April 2020 to end Feb 2021. Hours clock up but not heard anything. Don't think it works.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 17:48:54__

> This app won't let me download at all I have a Samsung A20E.<br> :date: __2021-02-24 13:22:40__

> Wow, OK, so the developer response to reviews that calls out a forced square crop on the licence says "take a photo of your licence and the table it is sitting on, so you can crop a combination of the license and the background it to a square". See Richard M's review below as an example. Yet the photo of the AED allows for any size and shape crop. So the developers have figured out how to allow an any size crop for selecting one photo, but don't want to apply that to another? I'm betting that the reason I can't save my AED location is because the app doesn't just select a photo, it selects and forces a crop, and in cropping it, it probably loses the location data that is in the Exif information that I have confirmed is embedded in the original photo.<br> :date: __2021-02-18 07:00:49__

> Had so much Grief with this app. Had no alerts for so long is forgot it was installed. My circumstances changed so needed to edit what I was able to help with, app wouldn't allow this. Regrettably had to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 10:54:55__

> My brother's android go mobile "incompatible" with this software Guess that's the price of volunteering So that's one person wishing to volunteer but excluded from doing so by this gatekeeper..<br> :date: __2021-02-15 19:22:38__

> The installation is clunky. If there's anything going to stop somewhere using an app, that'll be it. (I test and write software as a profession.) It's hard to scroll the page without hitting a selector (such as the country). The image crop allows only a square and could not set to the width of my driver's license, so part of the license was cut off. After several attemps of that, I was forced to select Work ID instead of Drivers License. And please fully capitalise countries' names! Edit: Thank you for your reply. I know how to use a camera. The image I was trying to use had the full driver's license - it was the cropping that did not allow me to use any more than 2/3 of the image that was previously taken by the camera. Edit 2: As noted, it can get into a state where a community responder cannot select 'drivetrs license. Was this app tested by devs?<br> :date: __2021-02-15 10:49:38__

> I got another siren today at 11:42. I immediately opened the app to accept, but a message told me as I had not responded it had been given to someone else. Again the alert came 40 minutes AFTER the request. I got a "siren" on my phone for the first time the other day at 13:50. I responded straight away, however the task was requested at 13:10 and was given to someone else as they stated I hadn't responded. Why did I get the alert 40 minutes AFTER the request? Very disappointed!<br> :date: __2021-02-14 12:52:08__

### Description
> Campus is the Airbus app that helps you quickly locate where you are and what is around you whilst visiting an Airbus site. The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> Active 10 is a free and easy to use walking app that tracks your walking and shows you how you can increase your intensity to benefit your health. The app is designed to support you every step of the way to increase your daily level of physical activity, with simple and achievable milestones and rewards along the way.
<br>Key features:
<br>* Tracks all your walking and how many minutes were brisk
<br>* Rewards every brisk minute achieved throughout the day, so perfect for those starting from low levels of activity
<br>* Promotes goal setting to help keep you motivated and help you progress
<br>* Store and view up to 12 months of your walking activity, to see how far you have come 
<br>* Discover loads of hints and tips on achieving a healthier lifestyle
<br>BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH
<br>We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!
<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great app for beginners or return to fitness users. I have used this app to measure my gradual return to form following long Covid symptoms. I could compare how much walking I did before and after. I am glad to say I am almost back to my pre-covid form. Thanks goodness!<br> :date: __2021-02-26 16:48:24__

> Brilliant<br> :date: __2021-02-26 08:26:46__

> Very good motivator.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 21:43:48__

> Encouraging<br> :date: __2021-02-24 09:10:14__

> Excellent app keeps you motivated<br> :date: __2021-02-23 16:54:36__

> Easy to use and really focuses the mind on brisk walking 🚶‍♂️rather than just strolling<br> :date: __2021-02-22 09:45:07__

> Great app. Try to use it everyday. Unlike other mere step counter apps, it actually encourages you to do worthwhile effective walking.<br> :date: __2021-02-22 02:32:36__

> This is a very useful app. Only recording the target you choose.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 19:28:04__

> Great motivator. Amazing to see how walk times add up over each day.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 14:12:51__

> Good tracker and motivator to get up and get out. So easy to amble around and kid yourself that you're doing some good. While you might well be, it helps to focus on brisk minutes (set your level) to get yourself moving. I feel I am pretty active but achieving three sets of ten 'briskmins' in a day can still be a challenge... which I work to achieve. So it works! Easy to set up and use. Good luck.<br> :date: __2021-02-20 11:32:39__

> I love this app and use it daily. Only gripe is that you can only have a target of 30 minutes maximum.<br> :date: __2021-02-26 01:48:55__

> Measures brisk walking via GPS. I feel better having completed a few active 10s. 10 minutes brisk. Apparently very good for you. Gives award icons.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 08:54:00__

> Like using this app. It stopped for several weeks and wasny recording the minutes walked. Its seems to be ok now . Nit sure if I like all the new format though. Too many different targets, rewards etc .<br> :date: __2021-02-24 17:45:43__

> Morale booster<br> :date: __2021-02-24 15:14:12__

> Really good would be even better if it could tell you calories burnt aswell.<br> :date: __2021-02-23 21:09:47__

> Motivational, but I think it's definition of brisk pace is a bit harsh on those with short legs or buggies to push!<br> :date: __2021-02-22 22:12:00__

> Engourages me to walk faster<br> :date: __2021-02-21 19:26:03__

> Self conscious about how energetically I walk<br> :date: __2021-02-20 19:29:01__

> Useful for setting targets and rewards but a bit basic. Pedometer and distance tracker would improve progress monitoring<br> :date: __2021-02-20 12:45:20__

> Would like a bike app as well<br> :date: __2021-02-19 14:40:45__

> Downloaded this to measure what I do. As a person with a disability it is slightly disappointing. I walked for 15mins as briskly as I could and it left me out of breath, however, this apparently wasn't good enough to register as brisk. Trust me, for me it was very brisk. It needs to be able to be adjusted to take these things into account.<br> :date: __2021-02-21 16:50:12__

> It's an ok app to get you motivated and doing a daily walk. Like others have said it only seems to monitor the really brisk walking. Doesn't take into account inclines. It has made me move more alongside the NHS 12 week plan . Say if you set off to do 20 minutes and it hasn't monitored the slower walk due to a hill. It might only have registered 18 minutes of the brisk walking. I have then found myself going out again to complete the full 20 minutes. So I suppose it does work hahaha<br> :date: __2021-02-20 12:43:42__

> Good idea but a little glitchy<br> :date: __2021-02-20 12:20:44__

> Useful when working properly but not reliable. Sometimes only registers 12 minutes walking on a 30 minute walk. The brisk count seems to be okay now.<br> :date: __2021-02-17 09:53:54__

> Does encourage me to walk faster for longer. However doesn't always count brisk steps which is really frustrating and annoying.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 09:02:41__

> Not easy to understand.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 21:00:39__

> I find it helpful when it works but some days it doesn't .<br> :date: __2021-02-08 14:16:50__

> The new version isn't as good as the old one. Not as easy to track down he month's walking. Can we have old one back?<br> :date: __2021-02-07 13:43:58__

> It was working great keep me motivated until it stopped registering any steps that I had done. Also showed steps one day but were not there the next.<br> :date: __2021-02-04 07:12:57__

> It's great for motivating me to just do 20-30 mins brisk walking each day. But the minutes it records changes later in the day - reduces! So it may say I did 33 mins brisk, then suddenly it changes to 28 mins brisk - which is very annoying. If they could iron that issue out it would be great.<br> :date: __2021-02-02 09:15:50__

> My phone came with this app installed & I used it for years. Sadly it now requires me to enter a password for a samsung account which I don't have. My phone is quite old, & I imagine this is something which has come in since I got it. There seems to be no way through this, so I cannot use it any more & have lost my data. If not for this I would have given 4 stars. I found it very useful.<br> :date: __2021-02-16 19:39:53__

> Doesn't take into consideration somebody's starting fitness level or age. I went for a walk for 40 minutes in the snow came back sweating and out of breath. My doctor says that is a brisk walk and good for me the app size I did 5-minutes. I feel that you need to be jogging for it to say you're walking briskly. Not all bad it does tell you how long you've been walking for.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 17:04:25__

> Very disappointed that the app doesn't always count the brisk steps. If I put my phone in my pocket it counts steps but not brisk steps. I have to hold the phone in my hand for it to work properly. It took me a long while to work this out. It was helpful to read that other people had experienced the same problem and I tried holding it as a result. Nowhere on the app to discuss problems like this. When it does count accurately I find it very useful and motivating.<br> :date: __2021-02-10 13:31:15__

> A 20 minute walk is apparently 40 minutes. Unsure if this actually measures the time of the walk correctly however it definitely encourages you to be more active. I'd give it more if it was more accurate.<br> :date: __2021-02-06 21:27:37__

> Recently has consistently failed to record what I know must be brisk walking given the number of people I overtake, and the distance. Am going to uninstall. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2021-02-05 16:21:50__

> Sometimes works sometimes doesn't.. Bit more than frustrating at times... Still the steps are done which is the point..<br> :date: __2021-02-04 12:38:59__

> Doesn't recognize brisk walking on my HTC desire 530, even if I jog and I've tried it in every pocket.<br> :date: __2021-02-01 19:11:34__

> Although it's an encouraging app, I've noticed it's not completely accurate but helps general motivational. I would be really happy if it actually measured the distances walked or run.<br> :date: __2021-01-28 14:56:11__

> Regularly does not track my brisk walking unless I hold the phone in my hand while I walk.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 10:53:20__

> I walked, and my walks were measured and I got a badge , great! Then walks disappeared😐uninstalled and re installed.. same thing🤷👎 Good idea, but its not working properly<br> :date: __2021-01-17 15:35:42__

> The app suddenly stopped working after 6 days. I have reinstalled it, but very disappointed as it was quite motivating.<br> :date: __2021-02-25 08:17:55__

> Easy to use app but totally inaccurate. After my last positive review I have changed my opinion. My watch and mobile can say fir instance I gave walked for two hours yet the app will say I have walked 41 minutes with 10 minutes of it brisk, it makes no sense. Initially it was accurate now its pretty useless.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 18:39:00__

> Been using this for several weeks. Opened it this morning, empty, no history, nothing retained. Pissed off.<br> :date: __2021-02-19 08:21:19__

> For a supposedly motivational app, this one is astonishingly demotivating! Regularly removing "Active" minutes a few hours after awarding them is not good. It has now started not recording anything about 1 day in 3 - just pretends my brisk walking didn't happen!<br> :date: __2021-02-11 12:49:37__

> It hasn't registered my walks for the last few days, definitely walking 'briskly' enough! Disappointed.<br> :date: __2021-02-09 13:42:28__

> I have no idea what you have to do to register brisk walking. I was walking at a pace to make me breath hard and built a sweat keeping the pace steady up and down hills. Result 31 minutes 0 brisk. Tried it again. This time despite walking for a couple of hours at the weekend and one again today, the app failed to record that I had walked at all, let alone briskly. It is therefore useless. Time to uninstall.<br> :date: __2021-02-03 12:30:13__

> Very poor app. Have installed and used it twice now. Both times my fitbit tracker recorded over 100 minutes brisk walking. This app recorded 3 minutes the first walk, and 19 the next. I have deleted it and won't bother again.<br> :date: __2021-01-31 12:59:27__

> Hopeless. Now worse. Keeps saying I might lose data as I need to log in every 30 days. I am pleased to see the return of rewards but when are you going to get the basics to work properly? It is showing 42 mins brisk walking today though I've only just got up but nothing at all for yesterday when I went for a long brisk walk and my data for 12 days ago never did appear.<br> :date: __2021-01-26 11:21:17__

> Installed first time and registered brisk walk, next few days nothing. Unistalled the Installed again and still not registering brisk walks or steps. A good idea but not working. Now unable to register as will not accept my Post Code / email address.<br> :date: __2021-01-23 09:01:21__

> This use to work, it's broken now<br> :date: __2021-01-19 16:37:53__

For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

Now I have no way of saving a PDF copy which was the feature I used the most. It hasn't fixed the size problem, trying to print to PDF gives 13 pages for a few page document, not even changing the paper size to A2 works!

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus](http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
