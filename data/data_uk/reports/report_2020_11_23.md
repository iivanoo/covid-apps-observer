Any feedback, questions, and improvements about the project are very welcome, feel free to create an issue or pull request directly in its GitHub repository: [http://github.com/covid-apps-observer](http://github.com/covid-apps-observer).

## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read from external storage. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. 
 **android.permission<br>WRITE_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.

<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.

> Would a regional breakdown of new cases<br> :date: __2020-07-31 00:38:27__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.
<br> 
<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages. 
<br> 
<br>Download the app now, and join the OpenWHO community.
<br>This app is developed in cooperation between the Hasso Plattner Institute and the WHO. The learning content is provided exclusively by the WHO.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The new NHS COVID-19 app is the Official NHS contact tracing app for England and Wales. 
<br>It is the fastest way of knowing when you’re at risk from Coronavirus. The quicker you know, the quicker you can alert your loved ones, and your community. 
<br>The more of us that use it, the better we can control coronavirus. 
<br>The app runs on proven software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. And you can delete your data, or the app, at any time.
<br>It has a number of features: 
<br>- Trace: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have tested positive for coronavirus
<br>- Alert: Lets you know the level of coronavirus risk in your postcode district. 
<br>- Check-in: Get alerted if you have visited a venue where you may have come into contact with coronavirus, using a simple QR code scanner. No more form filling. 
<br>- Symptoms: Check if you have coronavirus symptoms and see if you need to order a test. 
<br>- Test: Helps you order a test if you need to.
<br>- Isolate: Keep track of your self-isolation countdown and access relevant advice.
<br>Available in English, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish, Urdu and Welsh.
<br>The app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.
<br>Protect your loved ones. Please download the app. 
<br>The App is CE marked as a class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with European Commission Directive 93/42/EEC for class I devices.


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Department of Health and Social Care |
| **Website**  | [https://covid19.nhs.uk/](https://covid19.nhs.uk/) |
| **Email** | NHSCovid-19AppStoreSupport@nhsbsa.nhs.uk |
| **Physical address**  | - |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Department+of+Health+and+Social+Care) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

> I've had no issues other than when I had covid, track n trace called 3 or 4 times a day, each person I had been in contact with meant they created numerous 'accounts' for me and so they were forever trying to update all the accounts, they need to find a way to just have one cos it's not ideal ...but better they ring 10 times than not at all I guess<br> :date: __2020-11-21 11:46:06__

> Check in works well but rumours are that it remains checked-in until you check-in somewhere else or at midnight you're automatically checked out. Is this true?<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:21:17__

> Was hoping that this app would be useful (I've not given up and hope that I receive a response to this review). I have installed the app, entered my details, confirmed my email address and entered the code following that. I then come to the page asking me to accept the conditions of use but the page (apart from the heading) is blank and I cannot get any further than that. I tried going back to the previous page but the app closed. I successfully logged in to the app again but stuck same spot.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 03:00:20__

> So far so good. Husband had report when his best friend tested positive (although friend told us) very quickly and we isolated for his 14 day countdown clock. Unfortunately, the other friend who was with them all evening was never contacted but we would all inform each other in our village. This would have been a big error in an Urban area. So more needs to be done on this app.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 23:54:32__

> It would be nice to be able to change the postcode. I've recently returned to the UK and entered the postcode of where I was staying for quarantine, but now I am unable to edit the postcode to reflect where I am currently living, which is a bit annoying. Particularly if we move back to the tiered system.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 20:03:04__

> I've had a few of the false 'possible covid exposure' notices and a self-isolation alert for an anonymous user but now that a work colleague has actually tested positive for coronavirus, the app isn't telling me to self-isolate. We lunch outside together every day so I know we've been less than 2m away for more than 15 mins many, many times in the last 14 days. Both of us had the apps on, so why no notification?<br> :date: __2020-11-21 18:45:04__

> So I've just literally downloaded this about 20 minutes ago and it's still activating . It takes so long<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:36:31__

> Changed phones. Now won't re- download. I have had the wheel of death for three days saying "PENDING ".Tried deleting and reinstalling. Nothing.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:29:31__

> Didn't get to use the app for being under 16. Feel like it would be good for young people to have access to the app as well because of children typically bring asymptomatic carriers of COVID<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:52:06__

> Seems to want to track me while at home, I don't leave my GPS and Bluetooth on 247 which makes the app kind of flawed.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:42:28__

> Now seems to work, after quite a bit of messing about clearing various caches<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:27:12__

> When traveling to different areas the app dosent update the area alert level<br> :date: __2020-11-18 17:58:15__

> Woke up to an exposure notification that disappeared when I clicked on it to yo open the app. Useless, get it together! Wow, yes, the thing uses Google and apple notifications to let us know! Great, now how is that useful information? Are the notifications true? Ridiculous<br> :date: __2020-11-18 16:30:19__

> Easy enough to use, but notifications are awful - "You were with someone with covid but you are fine and we will not tell you anything else" would be a more accurate notification. Could be VERY scary for someone in a high risk group. About the standard of TalkTalk internet. Dido Harding should resign. Edit: Used a custom home screen to change the app icon to the "not helth" meme. A much more accurate icon!<br> :date: __2020-11-22 15:44:46__

> See<br> :date: __2020-11-22 14:53:53__

> In glad ut has started to work however on my Samsung device I'm experiencing "fake exposure notifications on my phone" and when I go on the app nothing appears its quite annoying not gonna lie. This needs to be fixed ASAP<br> :date: __2020-11-22 11:56:24__

> Often crashes on Pixel 3, won't stay running, so basically not fit for purpose for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:26:45__

> App doesn't seem to allow update. Stuck on the September version, even though a November update is apparently available. Won't accept reference provided by the test center and won't allow skipping of the question. So app is stuck in 'self isolate' state even though government email confirmed I have the 'all clear'. Seems a waste of taxpayer money that this app is still so poor.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 17:02:12__

> I'm not sure how long the app takes to notify you if you have come into contact with a covid positive person. I did this morning, they have the app that states they are positive. I've had no notification yet. 🤨<br> :date: __2020-11-20 18:28:24__

> Told me to self isolate for 14 days.. I live on my own in a 1 bed flat and have not left the house. Perhaps I got infected through the walls... Doesn't make sense to me! Turn the tracking off when your at home or driving<br> :date: __2020-11-20 14:08:42__

> Asks for your postcode and then reports the risk level based on your local authority. Postcodes are a fairly arbitrary geo-tagging mechanism used by the post office and have little connection to most authorities. Mine is not even in the right county! So far from being informative, it's misleading. It appears that the isolation instructions given in the app are DIFFERENT to those given by the NHS. Sadly, this is just one of several contradictions in advice and instructions given.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 10:12:58__

> Would be worth seeing a map based on ones location and those who are using the app around me<br> :date: __2020-11-19 20:49:58__

> They told us it didn't require location tracking, but it does. And the implementation in general has been a shambles. EDIT - The Department of Health and Social Care say below that the app doesn't access our location. And I completely understand why it doesn't need to to do its job (that's why I installed it). But as someone who never has location tracking enabled on my phone, the app very clearly tells me that it can't work unless I turn location tracking on. Try it yourself. Why is this?<br> :date: __2020-11-19 18:09:09__

> Doesn't work properly... stops working without you realising so if you don't go on the app it stops scanning... mine wasn't scanning for 2 weeks without me realising!!!! Also when it does work it sends out 'possible exposure' notifications and then gives no more information causing a great deal of worry.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:05:30__

### Description
> Help Scotland keep the spread of coronavirus under control by downloading and using the free Protect Scotland app from NHS Scotland’s Test and Protect service. 
<br>Using the app is entirely voluntary.  When you use the app, you will be alerted if you have been in close contact with another app user who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive and you enter the unique code sent to you into the app, it will anonymously warn other app users whom you have been in close contact with.
<br>Using Bluetooth, the app will search for other devices with the Protect Scotland app installed, which are within 2m of your phone. You don’t need to have a WiFi connection. The app uses a very small amount of your mobile phone data.  
<br> Once you’ve downloaded the app, encourage your friends, family and colleagues to do so too. The more people who download and use the Protect Scotland app, the more likely we are to keep coronavirus under control. . The benefits of using the app are:  Speeds up the process of identifying and notifying people that have been at risk of catching coronavirus, particularly of unknown contacts Slows the spread of the virus Reduces the likelihood of further lockdowns Helps protect the health service, your family and friends, yourself and the people of Scotland
<br>Ultimately, you can help to stop the spread of coronavirus in Scotland by downloading and using the Protect Scotland app.
<br>Privacy and Data
<br>The Protect Scotland app is designed to protect the privacy of all users. It doesn’t store or share any personally identifiable information, like your name or address. Nobody can track your location by using the app or tell who you are.
<br>You can remove the app from your device at any time, and all the data stored on your phone will be deleted.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> I have not, thankfully been exposed to anyone who have tested positive for covid, but I have friends who use this app who have. From listening to them and hearing their experience proves that the Scottish app works<br> :date: __2020-11-15 03:26:08__

> YES I KNOW ITS MENT TO PROTECT SCOTLAND FROM COVID BUT im 12 in secondary school and This app was recommended by google play its self it said Pegi 3 so i downloaded it yesterday i forgot about then went back into it today and it came with two options im over 16 or under i said under as I am it said you are not entitled to use this app so undownload it so i did the point to this is *what is the point of making this a pegi 3 and only 16 are entitled to use this app* Thank you goodbye.............<br> :date: __2020-10-22 22:52:46__

> The app is great the alerts go off all the time outside the parligment building Edinburgh so who's not telling they have it<br> :date: __2020-10-19 18:17:39__

> Having issues with it not doing exposure checks unless I kill and restart the app. Apart from that, the app works.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 19:45:35__

> Beware software updates. I have a Samsung phone onto which I downloaded this app. 2 days ago I received an android/Samsung software update message and installed it. This app was shut down in the process which I had not noticed and was therefore not working for the last 2 days. I had no warning this would happen and as a result I have either put myself or someone else at risk. BEWARE.<br> :date: __2020-10-10 10:00:43__

> Dead easy to instal and setup.And after reading reviews that it drained battery power, all was fine. Shame it doesn't have a venue check in tool like the England and Wales one, instead you are relying on venues to gather details via their sometimes dodgy third party sites who can cash in on signing you up for marketing data. Or worse still, paper and pen. Issue is cross-border using alongside the England & Wales one and disappointing had no reply back by email when I asked this point especially since I was encouraged to install it for a short visit. I was in Scotland up until 3rd October for three nights. Switched back to the NHS England & Wales one when I stepped off the train in Carlisle. But other than going in a couple of times a day switching the Exposure Notifications to the Protect Scotland App I won't know if I get any app notification. And again if I get tested in England and unfortunately it's a positive, I would really like to do my bit and notify Protect Scotland app users I may have been in close contact with. But I understand the codes issued aren't compatible.<br> :date: __2020-10-05 12:22:27__

If I pass by someone who's marked they have Covid on it and it beeps me, I don't imagine anything different would happen.

> I have the app on my phone but it keeps randomly turning the tracing function off? I check it every few days and often find that the tracing is black and informs me that I need to turn it on.

### Description
> This is the official digital contact tracing and exposure notification application provided by Public Health, Government of Jersey for visitors and citizens on the island of Jersey.
<br>By using the app you can help prevent and contain outbreaks of COVID-19. 
<br>The app will warn you with an Exposure Alert if you have been near someone who has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.  If you choose, you can ask the Contact Tracing Team to call you for specific advice and support if you get an Exposure Alert.  
<br>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, the app lets you anonymously warn people you were near to before you became aware that you were infectious. Only people with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can do this with the support of the Contact Tracing Team.
<br>Your privacy is protected:
<br>•        No personal information needed to sign up
<br>•        The app does not record your location and does not use GPS. 
<br>•        The app is built with strong privacy protection. 
<br>•        Use of the app is always voluntary. 
<br>•        The app will ask your permission to share any data. 
<br>•        The app can be uninstalled at any time. 
<br>•        It is extremely unlikely that you could be identified by other users while using the app. 
<br>Developed on behalf of Public Health (JHA) by Digital Health (HCS) and Digital Jersey.

I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!<br> :date: __2020-11-14 21:29:22__

### Description
> If you are 11 or older and live in Northern Ireland you can use this HSC contact tracing app. By using it you will help stop or slow the spread of coronavirus.
<br>** Support the health services **
<br>** Help avoid more lockdowns **
<br>** Save lives **
<br>How does the app work?
<br>If you are in close contact with an app user who has told their app that they have COVID-19, you will get an alert from this app. You won’t know who it was or where it happened. You must then self-isolate for the period shown in the app. There’s advice on how to self-isolate and answers to common questions about this in the app.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you can tell this app. Other app users that you’ve been close to will then be alerted. They won’t know that it was you or where it happened.
<br>** Works in the background on Bluetooth, not GPS, and uses very little battery **
<br>** Please keep Bluetooth on so the app can work properly **
<br>How is my privacy protected?
<br>** This app never knows your name or where you are, so it’s completely private **
<br>It uses the ‘Exposure Notification API’ developed by Apple and Google in a joint effort to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, with user privacy and security core to the design. This is sometimes called the ‘decentralised’ model.
<br>If you test positive for COVID-19 you will get a code by SMS text message from 'HSCresult'. When you put your code into this app you will be asked to share the 'Random IDs’ that your phone has been swapping with other app users over the last 14 days. This will allow us to tell those people that they have been exposed to COVID-19. 
<br>** We will never ask you to reply to the SMS text message **
<br>** Please ignore any message if it asks you to reply or send information **
<br>So that you can use this app when travelling abroad we will securely share 'Random IDs' with other countries. This also means that apps used by visitors from those countries will work here.
<br>** This app will never track your identity or location **


### User interface
The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

> Just discovered the app had been "Auto Disabled" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).<br> :date: __2020-10-21 23:33:44__

> Please add the capacity to scan QR codes like the NHS app does, not having this function leads to confusion in dealing with GB businesses in NI<br> :date: __2020-10-10 08:57:01__

> It seems to work, and I really hope it does.. it is simple, and not intrusive. I look forward to seeing his it pans out.<br> :date: __2020-10-08 01:00:45__

> This app only checks exposure if it comes within a short distance of someone else who has the app. No exposure checks mean you havent been close enough to someone for it to check.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 20:06:28__

> QUERY! If having to move devices, how are you supposed to transfer the existing exposure checks from the previous 14 days to the new device, in case any of those report a positive case?<br> :date: __2020-09-21 22:39:02__

> Once running, seems to be very good. But was hard to find. Wasn't immediately clear if there was a background daemon service running or the app had to be "minimized" but not closed to work. Samsung Galaxy 8 running Android 9: It seems Samsung's battery optimisation service was killing the app. After a reboot, it seemed OK, though. Closing/swiping away the app and then toggling bluetooth on/off showed it was still running (I got an alert from the app saying bluetooth needs enabled).<br> :date: __2020-08-13 21:40:20__

> No problems downloading and it appears active on my Samsung S10. Would love to understand more about the keys as we're registering them without leaving the house!<br> :date: __2020-08-12 22:11:42__

> Seems to work just fine, but the interface is slow and it's hard to know if this is actually running or if I have to load up the app manually every time.<br> :date: __2020-08-07 11:52:24__

> I found it easily, I just typed in covid and found the app. But like others have said, when you close the app and open it it says tracing not active then changes to active. Unsure if it is working when the app isn't open.<br> :date: __2020-08-04 11:47:01__

> I don't know<br> :date: __2020-10-11 18:11:48__

> Downloaded this when it became available, but after the last update, it keeps pushing me to turn my bluetooth on and restart the app; my Bluetooth has been on, and restarting the app doesn't help. Only had this issue since the update, but makes having the app pretty much useless.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 15:06:04__

> Mine barely checks (once in 14 days) but my friends checks multiple times a day. I'm nearer much more people than them so I don't understand.<br> :date: __2020-10-11 11:19:25__

> I downloaded the app. I get that someone will notify me if I come into contact with someone who has the app and then tests positive. However, I feel it should give people either daily or weekly updates of places that the person has been and I wonder when two mobile phones that have the app downloaded on the phones - do they react to each other. Another thing is people on the island of ireland both north and south of the island should be able to use both apps together.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 23:59:37__

> Whose bright idea was it to remove the statistics section (daily number changes etc.) from the app, and not adding a link to where the information can be found?<br> :date: __2020-10-05 18:42:45__

> It took a while to download and install. However when you first open the app it says "tracing not active " this suggests the app is not running in the background. Working great now.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 21:30:20__

> I don't see the point in this app. As I checked today 2nd November as I'd accidentally knocked off Bluetooth. Seen it last checked on 12th October.

> So, I downloaded this app to complain... about the idiots who have downloaded the app then given it a 1 star review for not being made for the UK 1. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory, as such it is relevant to the UK, you imbaciles. 2. It does tell you it is made specifically for Gibraltar, check the name of the app, you uncultured swine. 3. If you are not from Gibraltar it isn't relevant to you. This does not mean you should give it a negative review, as that does not make it a bad app.<br> :date: __2020-09-27 14:21:48__

> Ok, I only downloaded this app last night & although the reviews seem ok. This was the 1st & main app for COVID-19 tracking. Yes I realise Gibraltar is it's main domain, I get it. But seeing as this was my only option really, Am I just meant to look at the compass tracker, watching random green dots faintly appearing, with the blue screen just saying "Active"/click if i tested positive? How do i know? I don't! We can't just ask 4 test. Bluetooth is always on. So do i just wait 4 an alert? 🤷🏻‍<br> :date: __2020-07-31 22:24:09__

> This App is not designed for th UK, it is designed only for Gibraltar the app is useless, contact the developer like i did, UK citizen you will be told we can't use it in the UK 🇬🇧 This is their response "This App has been developed specifically with Gibraltar in mind. It is open for download by anyone, including cross-frontier workers and persons who regularly visit Gibraltar. If you are not in Gibraltar (whether residing, working or visiting) this app is of no real use to you"<br> :date: __2020-07-30 22:25:30__

### Description
> Take 1 minute each day and help fight the spread of COVID-19 in your community
<br>* Report your health daily even if you feel well
<br>* Get a daily estimate of COVID in your area
<br>* Help slow the outbreak near you
<br>Join millions of people supporting scientists at Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and King's College London to help fight coronavirus by identifying:
<br>* How fast the virus is spreading in your area
<br>* High-risk areas in the US
<br>* Who is most at risk, by better understanding symptoms linked to underlying health conditions
<br>You will contribute to advance research on COVID-19 in partnership with leading health researchers globally like TwinsUK, one of the most clinically detailed studies in the world.
<br>This app (formerly known as the Covid Symptom Tracker) allows you to help others, but does not give health advice. If you need health advice please visit the CDC website at: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
<br>This app has been designed for everyone to report their status not just those who are ill.
<br>It was designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas’ Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company.
<br>In the US the app is being used by the Nurses' Health Study to identify symptoms in active healthcare workers who are treating people with COVID across the country and risking their own health to help us.
<br>In response to recommendations by Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), the app also includes questions for cancer patients and survivors, such as if they are living with cancer, what type of cancer and what treatment they are receiving.
<br>If you would like to help out in this difficult time, then you can. Download the app and share daily your own status, even if you are well. With your help we can understand much better the situation across the nation, how the disease presents itself to different people, and how it progresses.
<br>This is a new virus which the world has never seen before. There are a wide range of symptoms, which differ between people. With your help we can understand better how the disease presents itself depending upon individual factors such as health and age.
<br>No information you share will be used for commercial purposes.
<br>There are two parts to the app:
<br>HEALTH INFORMATION
<br>You will be asked to share some general information, such as your age and some health details, such as whether you have certain diseases.
<br>SYMPTOM TRACKING
<br>We will ask you every day to let us know how you feel, so you can share your symptoms. We will also ask whether you have visited the hospital, what treatment you received there, and whether you have been tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Zoe Global Limited |
| **Website**  | [http://covid.joinzoe.com/](http://covid.joinzoe.com/) |
| **Email** | covid@joinzoe.com |
| **Physical address**  | [164 Westminster Bridge Road London SE1 7RW United Kingdom](https://www.google.com/maps/search/164%20Westminster%20Bridge%20Road%20London%20SE1%207RW%20United%20Kingdom) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

On the occasions that additional information is requested the wording of questions limit input from those outside the demographic options.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:01:31__

> The app 'forgot' me for a while and resetting the password was not as straightforward as it should be. The 'login' function seemed unresponsive at several points. But overall it feels like a good way to contribute to the understanding of where this virus is heading, so I have stuck with it.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:16:46__

> Easy and quick to use. Now mostly warns if there is no connection. However if connection is later lost whilst reporting symptoms, this is not reported. \*\*\*\* Version number shown on menu screen is stuck at 1.0.0, actual version is now 2.0.1 \*\*\*\*<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:56:13__

> This app has worked well and I have reported most days for several months without a problem. But in the last week, there have been problems logging in, being asked for a password when it already should have it. Then the last few days, the page has loaded to report and then gone blank before I am able to click the report button. I have uninstalled and reloaded the page several times and finally, was able to log in. Will persevere because I trust this app and believe it is worthwhile.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:44:20__

I think you should be including political affiliation and source of respondents news about covid.

> Used to be great and I felt good to be part of helping research. Unfortunately, about a week ago the app disappeared from my phone and I had to reinstall and login which I'd never done previously. And now, this new version doesn't remind me to report either so I quite often forget. Perhaps the Zoe team don't need my input anymore?

> There is no facility to show that I had an antibody test not an antigen test which was positive. So now your data looks like I had covid twice. I had it in march with no test. I had positive antibody test in June and a positive antibody test eight months after the illness in November. Your results will be skewed of the data of antibodies and antigen tests is put in the same question<br> :date: __2020-11-21 11:48:54__

> I fill in the questionnaire every morning, the icon shows that I've done it today, yet later I get a notification and when I check in the app it says I haven't done it, so I do it again.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

### Description
> This app is part of a research project at the University of Cambridge. The aim of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms to automatically detect if a person is suffering of COVID-19, based primarily on sounds of their voice, their breathing and coughing. 
<br>In order to enable this research we are launching a large scale, crowdsourced data collection through a mobile app. The app will collect some basic demographics and medical history data, as well as some voice samples (while you read text on the screen) through a questionnaire and a few seconds of breathing and coughing through the phone microphone. We will additionally collect one location sample. The app will also ask if you have tested positive for the virus. The app won't be tracking you and only collect this data when you actively interact with it. 
<br>The data will be stored on University servers and be used solely for research purposes. We hope to release the dataset we are collecting to other researchers after the initial analysis. 
<br>The app will not give medical advice and any reports of symptoms will not be responded to by medical assistance.
<br>This app is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Greek, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.

The developers of the app provide the following screenshots in the Google play store.

### Description
> <b>This is not the NHS COVID-19 app. To download the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app, go to covid19.nhs.uk</b>
<br>Owned and run by the NHS, the NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of NHS services on your smartphone or tablet.
<br>To use the NHS App you must be aged 13 and over and registered with a GP surgery in England.
<br>You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer. Go to www.nhs.uk/app
<br>Use the NHS App to:
<br>•	get advice about coronavirus
<br>•	order your repeat prescriptions
<br>•	book and manage appointments at your GP surgery
<br>•	get health information and advice
<br>•	view your health record securely
<br>•	register your organ donation decision
<br>•	find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>If your GP surgery or hospital offers other services in the NHS App, you may be able to:
<br>•	message your GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
<br>•	consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
<br>•	access health services on behalf of someone you care for
<br>•	view your hospital and other healthcare appointments
<br>•	view useful links your doctor or health professional has shared with you
<br>•	view and manage your care plans
<br>Get advice about coronavirus 
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Get information about coronavirus and find out what to do if you think you have it.
<br>Order repeat prescriptions 
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>See your available medicines, request a new repeat prescription and choose a pharmacy for your prescriptions to be sent to.
<br>Book appointments
<br>--------------------------
<br>Search for, book and cancel appointments at your GP surgery. See details of your upcoming and past appointments.
<br>Get health advice
<br>-----------------------------
<br>Search trusted NHS information and advice on hundreds of conditions and treatments. You can also answer questions to get instant advice or medical help near you. 
<br>View your health record
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Securely access your GP health record, to see information like your allergies and your current and past medicines. If your GP surgery has given you access to your detailed medical record, you can also see information like test results and details of your consultations. 
<br>Register your organ donation decision
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose to donate some or all of your organs and check your registered decision.
<br>Find out how the NHS uses your data
<br>-------------------------------------------------
<br>Choose if data from your health records is shared for research and planning.
<br>Keeping your data secure
<br>---------------------------------
<br>After you download the app, you will need to set up an NHS login and prove who you are. The app then securely connects to information from your GP surgery. 
<br>If your Android device supports fingerprint detection, you can use it to log in to the NHS App each time, instead of using a password and security code.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | NHS Digital |
| **Website**  | [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/help/) |
| **Email** | nhsapp@nhs.net |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Great APP which any idiot can use me included plus it also saves a lot of time either visiting or phoning Doctors especially when your really busy....5 STARS⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:55:48__

> I have had no problems as yet with the and hoping not to either I love the app I can order my meds I can send messages to my chemist make appointments so so good get my history on the urgent dont need for gp to write anything it is all there<br> :date: __2020-11-20 03:24:04__

> Just so easy to re-order my medicine. The Best app ! I registered while in Spain with a poor Internet connection - I followed the instructions. Just took a little patience.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 14:45:12__

> Thanks for the prompt advice. My mishtake. Works well 👍<br> :date: __2020-11-19 13:01:23__

> Good1<br> :date: __2020-11-18 15:25:36__

> Had no problems...easy registered....It would be great within the app...if your chosen pharmacy, could let you know when your items are ready to pick up. The pharmacy we go to have released their app, similar to Patient Access, with the difference being...the new app lets you know when meds are ready....would be perfect if it was all under one umbrella, without the need to download so many apps 😊<br> :date: __2020-11-18 14:54:15__

> Much easier than doctors web site<br> :date: __2020-11-17 20:42:14__

> Very good useful app.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 19:23:26__

> A really good app - once you've got through the initial setup and proved identity etc, just uses the fingerprint scanner on the phone to log in, and you can order your repeate prescription, look back at your medical notes etc. The functionality is there to book appointments but my GP surgery seems to have turned that off (but that's not the fault of the app).<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:42:11__

> Excellent!!<br> :date: __2020-11-17 12:40:59__

> Was hoping that this app would be useful (I've not given up and hope that I receive a response to this review). I have installed the app, entered my details, confirmed my email address and entered the code following that. I then come to the page asking me to accept the conditions of use but the page (apart from the heading) is blank and I cannot get any further than that. I tried going back to the previous page but the app closed. I successfully logged in to the app again but stuck same spot.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 03:04:58__

> Great app for ordering repeat prescriptions, not tried to book appointment as yet.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 18:38:40__

> Easy to use, shame the historic medical history has to be answered every time you need to contact your GP<br> :date: __2020-11-20 09:28:33__

> Second time lucky, first time I installed the app, I got the unresponsive white screen others are reporting. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled the app and all seems fine now, the proving of my identity worked fine too.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 22:19:44__

> I didn't seem to have the same difficulty putting in my I d and personal details as everyone else seems to have. Using app I can see my prescription and my allergy, cannot book an appointment due to Co vid. Was hoping to view test results, but still waiting for gp surgery 4 weeks on. Helpful for ordering repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 11:24:54__

> Access your medical records and order repeat prescription.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 10:40:19__

> Easy to oparate.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 23:45:48__

> I've received an alert to say I have to self isolate as I have been in close contact with someone, but I haven't, last week I went to the doctors (who I called and are okay), a fish & chip shop to collect food, I wear gloves and touch nothing, & I popped into the co-op, in all cases I was not close to anyone, why have I been sent the message ?? Edit.... thank you for your note, sorry, I will contact the website you have suggested 😊<br> :date: __2020-11-17 22:06:03__

> App works absolutely fine for me. Uploaded all information using android phone. Requires NHS checks / approval based on id submission which is understandable given the personal data you'll be able to view. Having 10 digit NHS number to hand probably helps with ease of registration. With the app itself I like what I see.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 10:05:36__

> 2nd Update.. No issues installing the app and verifying my details. Able to order repeat prescriptions without issue. Unable to book/view/manage appointments which the NHS help desk advise me is due to my surgery disabling the function and not the app. In summary, everything working as it should it seems. Any problems reported are looked into and answered within a couple of days. Happy so far, will be happier when I'm able to book and view appointments. Thanks NHS for your efforts.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 11:31:17__

> Just ran an update. When I try to "Continue with NHS login", I just get a blank white page that goes nowhere. Updated review. Completely uninstalled app and reinstalled. This worked. Can login again. Upgraded the rating a couple of stars but can't give it more as it didn't work straight after the upgrade. I had used the app to describe symptoms and got a doctor call back within 36 hours from my local surgery.

> My initial review of this was far from flattering. Would NOT allow me to register using passport and video upload. Seems to be a common problem judging by other comments. Avoid this by using the alternative route and get your GP surgery to provide passcodes etc. Having finaly managed to register using these data, the App seems fine but it was a very stressful experience.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 13:26:32__

### Description
> C19 CONTROL is the fast and simple way for care providers to record and report COVID-19 status and PPE use on the frontline of care.  
<br> 
<br>Care staff can view a list of people being cared for, and for each person they can record the advice given by the official NHS service in their region; the relevant symptoms; and the appropriate COVID-19 status.  Care Staff can also record their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply levels, giving their Care Managers a real-time view of PPE needs across their team.
<br>Care managers can use the app to record the COVID-19 status for each of their care staff, and can quickly add new people to the list of care receivers and care staff.  Care Managers can also record the overall PPE levels for the care service, to help when re-ordering stock.
<br>Using the C19 CONTROL web portal, care managers can set the dependency level of people being cared for and can run reports of COVID-19status and dependency level for people being cared for, and COVID-19 status and PPE levels for care staff.
<br>The data recorded by C19 CONTROL will help both care providers as well as local, regional and national government organisations to gain a better understanding of the cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 across health and social care systems so that they can better anticipate health needs and plan resource requirements.

### Description
> This app has been developed for UCLH as part of their COVID-19 response. 
<br>The guidelines in this app have been authored by a wide range of clinical and staff, who have worked closely with our operational teams at UCLH and draws on all their invaluable expertise. It contains guidance on staff and patient protection, clinical care, clinician-facing standard operating procedures and educational materials.
<br> 
<br>The guidelines are based on:
<br>• The expertise of our teams
<br>• Existing best practice
<br>• Experience from colleagues working in organisations, cities and countries dealing with the COIVD-19 epidemic
<br>• Published research
<br>• Content released from professional and speciality organisations and associations
<br> 
<br>Content will expand rapidly over the coming days in response to clinical need for guidance, our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and as our approach adapts. The guidance will be made available through a release cycle. Each release will describe key changes since last time, this information can be found via the "version control" button.
<br> 
<br>Content has been approved UCLH COVID-19 clinical guideline committee.
<br> 
<br>Some of our guidance may be relevant to clinicians working in other organisations and we are keen to share approaches to clinical management and service design during this pandemic. Please refer to your local clinical and governance leads regarding adaption of any guidance locally and contact for any information about the guidance. We would also be keen to hear from non-UCLH clinicians regarding their learning, expertise and how we might improve our approach.

### Description
> CoronaReport is a citizen science project developed by the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy (SCPHRP), and the University of Edinburgh. Citizens can record their experiences of the disease, and the effects on their lives. The app is not intended to be used for/in emergencies or for diagnostics/medical purposes.
<br>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the viral pandemic affecting communities worldwide. The pandemic’s impacts are varied and substantial. CoronaReport is a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens. You can create public reports about your experiences, including how the virus is affecting your area and the way your community functions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, and businesses).
<br>About the project
<br>The collected and anonymized data from the reports will then be shared on the CoronaReport platform enabling you and other citizens to see first-hand accounts about how people are feeling and experiencing the impact of coronavirus. You can choose how much information you want to contribute to your reports and if you want to connect with others to share experiences. By working together citizens can build a real-time and vivid picture of how coronavirus is influencing the way people live and work. For example, we do not know the extent to which countermeasures like social distancing are being practised and how this, and other countermeasures, are affecting people’s well-being. Find out more about the project on the website: www.coronareport.global
<br>The project is running on the SPOTTERON Citizen Science Platform.

> It motivates but would like more encouragement and also on week 9 Michael Johnson said goodbye to me 3 times. Would like individual commentary for individual runs not the same spiel for evry run in a week.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 23:39:22__

> Love it, running with Michael Johnson 😍, perfect. The app builds you up and never pushes you further than you are able. I was coming back to running after a bout of Sciatica and working stupid hours in lockdown impacted on my running, i.e. I did none! Am now happily running for 30 minutes again 😀, and got my running mojo back.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:04:05__

> The program itself is great and I'm really enjoying it but the app keeps crashing. I have to keep restarting it which is frustrating when I'm trying to get into a rythmn and flow with my running.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 01:09:53__

> Jo is off putting talking nonsense and making you think its time to stop running, twice now she's ruined my run. So annoying! Only talk when it's time to stop.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 20:43:51__

> Its great but app keeps on stopping when im using it.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:50:05__

> App is good for workouts and motivation but it does keep crashing<br> :date: __2020-11-20 17:38:08__

> Great app but the annoying bell half way needs to be removed.<br> :date: __2020-11-18 03:18:07__

> It's a fantastic app, really encourages me to get out and I love how clever it is to interact with your music. However the only problem is it crashes 3-4 times each run so I end up walking or running much longer than intended<br> :date: __2020-11-17 11:43:00__

> I absolutely LOVE the actual guide - it has given me the ability to run, which is something I never thought I'd be able to do. 5/5 However, the app itself is incredibly frustrating. Sometimes when I trybto save my runs it just starts them from the beginning, which is inconvenient. Every time I start a new week the app tells me my selected trainer is 'unavailable', and I have to choose a new one. I've cycled through all options now and none of them work for longer than a week! Frustrating<br> :date: __2020-11-16 14:36:44__

> Very good when it doesn't crash. So annoying when the app crashes half way through a run.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:59:51__

> App closes randomly during the run<br> :date: __2020-11-15 17:20:26__

> Like the programme, but am finding that when I put my phone in my running pouch/waste belt it seems to pause itself so I have to keep taking it out and I eitherende up running or walking too long! I've tried switching my screen off but somehow it keeps pausing unless I hold my phone which is not desirable when running!<br> :date: __2020-11-12 20:37:54__

> Pretty much the shonkiest app out there, crashes 2/3 times per run and has failed to log the last 3 runs. The principle is fine, the execution is very poor.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 18:05:34__

> The apps only purpose is to ensure you get a clear instruction to run, or to stop running and walk. I've had to reinstall twice before week 8 because the trainer became mute. My music dips, but that's it.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:34:45__

> I have the app installed on my Huawei P10 and although I have adjusted the settings as recommended, the app often closes mid run. I also completed up to week 7 with Michael Johnson but now an error message appears and prevents this audio. Since installing the app back in July, I have had to uninstall and then reinstall because of these reoccurring issues.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 11:34:03__

> Idea is great, just finished 2nd run, same as 1st app reset numerous times.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 20:57:57__

> Unfortunately the app kept crashing making it incredibly difficult to use however the features of it seemed very promising.<br> :date: __2020-11-11 10:04:38__

> Keeps crashing on the journey. Spotify plays perfectly and the one you app turns it's self off<br> :date: __2020-11-09 19:48:10__

> Great idea. You had very high hopes of my fitness for the first run but I've kept at it, occasionally walking a running part until I could do it. End of week 4 now and twice your app has crashed while I was running. If I were walking it would be less of an issue but it isn't great when I am about to collapse before I realise I should have stopped running a while ago! Stop the crashing and I'll up you to 4 stars, give me a warm up so I don't damage my ankles again and I'll go up to 5.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 14:29:34__

> I've used this app in the past and it does the job well. BUT the audio is shocking. Can't hear what they're saying over my music,so am basically guessing I'm stopping and starting in right place!<br> :date: __2020-10-28 22:09:07__

Do an app that helps people lose weight not kill themselves running marathons.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:57:36__

> Broken and frustrating app, works for 5-10 mins then it stops and closes the app with out warning. I've double checked the settings on my phone to make sure it's set right but still doesn't work. Plenty of other apps that do C25k I'll try them<br> :date: __2020-11-07 12:10:51__

> Terrifible experience. Used it for the first time, built up the confidence to go out and the app kept crashing or the audio didn't come over the music. It was raining so I couldn't keep getting my phone out to restart it so after about 30 minutes (in which time I had only got about a quarter of the way through due to keep stopping to re-boot the app) I gave up and went home. Unfortunately it seems all the one star reviews are for the same thing so it must be a common problem.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 19:27:29__

> Really wanted to love this app as it's really clean and well designed, but I just can't get voice instructions to work. The music dips but there's no voice, so you have to keep looking at your phone. Not sure if I'm missing something or if this is the design of the app (or just a bug on my phone, Pixel 3).<br> :date: __2020-11-01 19:08:23__

### Description
> The Ministry of AYUSH presents the “Ayush Sanjivani” mobile application for understanding the measures adopted by public for enhancing immunity and keeping themselves healthy in the difficult COVID-19 situation. The app is designed as a simple but effective mechanism of electronic documentation for studying population behaviour. Response of the public to the advisories issued by the AYUSH Ministry on immunity enhancement will be an important area of examination. In addition, provision is also made for recording other measures (if any) propagated by AYUSH practitioners and adopted by general public for immunity enhancement and disease prevention. Data collected through this app will be analyzed to find out usage of AYUSH interventions and its efficacy in maintaining health by enhancing immunity.
<br>This app is at the centre of a massive exercise to study specific health seeking behaviours of the public in which the Central Research Councils of AYUSH, the National Institutes of AYUSH, numerous AYUSH educational institutions and state governments bodies collaborate. The Ministry has a target sample size of 1 million people for this study, making it one of the largest in any discipline of medicine. All those who volunteer to furnish information through this app will be making a significant contribution to the study of public health in the country.
<br>Data collected will be analyzed and will be useful for the AYUSH systems, and will establish their viability as health-assuring practices globally. This would also add momentum to the growth of the AYUSH Sector.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [https://www.ayush.gov.in/](https://www.ayush.gov.in/) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>WAKE_LOCK** | Normal | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.

### Description
> This app is designed by medics and scientists from Imperial College London with one intention: to stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising your privacy.
<br>It will let you know if any app user that you have had close contact with in past 14 days goes on to develop symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19.
<br>For example:
<br>If someone you waited next to in the supermarket queue last week gets a diagnosis of COVID-19 and records this in their app, you will be anonymously informed that someone you have previously been in close contact with now has the virus.You are now free to use this information about your potential exposure to make more educated decisions in your day to day life in order to limit the spread of the virus, protecting those that are most at risk. 
<br>You can also use this app to help others, by anonymously informing them if you get symptoms or a diagnosis relating to COVID-19. This will enable them to take appropriate action and minimise their risk of infecting others. 
<br>This app is an example of "privacy by design" as we believe the safest way to protect your personal information is by never collecting it in the first place. That is why this app will never even ask for your name and has no sign up whatsoever. We will also never use location data. You are completely anonymous. Neither us nor the government will ever be able to figure out who you are through this app.
<br>We use Bluetooth technology to register close contacts and use randomised anonymous IDs that refresh regularly as a substitute for names. For added privacy, this is all stored locally on your own device and only uploaded to the server if you report symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, only your personal device knows what IDs you have previously had, and hence only your personal device will be able to check if you have been exposed to someone with the virus. 
<br>We believe that the best way to do contact tracing is to collect only the absolute essential information. 
<br>No Names
<br>No Location
<br>No Log in
<br>Just contact tracing.

> Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 09:40:21__

> A bit iffy. Sometimes info is spot on, other times non existent, or plain wrong. Not really good enough for what they consider to be a Premium Brand. Sort yourselves out!<br> :date: __2020-11-20 11:01:26__

> Overall a very good service<br> :date: __2020-11-17 17:21:54__

> The first time I used this app it was awful and I gave up, it's now at least useable, but still needs a lot of work<br> :date: __2020-11-14 13:18:20__

> App is useful by some bug. The tracking pages need looking at badly<br> :date: __2020-11-13 19:39:37__

> Please allow the option to reference name a parcel/tracking number provided by a seller, even before it has a status attached.<br> :date: __2020-11-03 15:49:49__

> 3 * because I have tried to get a redelivery for a item and it won't allow me to redeliver keeps saying "validation error if this persists contact the site provider" brilliant idea but whats all that about?<br> :date: __2020-10-31 15:50:42__

> No collection service option. Was expecting to purchase my postage and select a collection in one simple app. But no, the new parcel collection service doesn't seem to be available as it is on the desktop site. Very disappointing as their competitors make it so easy.<br> :date: __2020-10-26 21:57:33__

> I don't use snail mail very often so don't buy stamps. For me this app is very welcome since it means not having to go online to buy postage. What it lacks and needs is the ability to print straight to an envelope rather than a label (their old service had this). It would be good if it could store your information so that you do not have to enter it each time. So good start Royal Mail now develop it further<br> :date: __2020-10-17 17:46:24__

> This app is generally useful but has two flaws. It doesn't remember your name and address, so every single time I print postage for a letter I have to re-type my it. Plus the need for a title when I only know someone's forename and surname is frustrating.<br> :date: __2020-10-16 14:13:11__

> Really good idea but be so careful when printing out labels.....the app tends to hold onto the last label bought so you may end up sending the item to the wrong person as I did<br> :date: __2020-11-17 21:38:40__

> I have received text messages from you saying that my parcel is due today at a certain time, and it's showing me that it has been delivered today, but i don't have any parcel, so can someone tell me what is going on with my parcel please, thanks.

> This app stresses me out lol<br> :date: __2020-11-06 12:42:20__

> You should add options for our tracking items where it should be if we're not at home. For example , where should we leave your package? In the shed etc.<br> :date: __2020-10-31 04:04:45__

> Want too much info and password setting is a joke<br> :date: __2020-10-30 00:09:31__

> Ok to track parcels, completely useless to alter delivery. Tried it twice so far, both times the request was ignored and I was bombarded with texts and e-mails advising me parcels couldn't be delivered on the day I'd already said to not deliver on. Then had to rebook the already rebooked delivery as the original request had been deleted! The app looks nice and is easy to use. Shame it seems to have absolutely no use other than that.<br> :date: __2020-10-29 21:08:28__

> Why does RM require one to sign up just for tracking a simple item? I don't see the point of making an account with RM app for such a simple thing. RM needs to change this feature on their app wherein you can track status of an item without having to sign up / log in<br> :date: __2020-10-27 11:51:31__

> Worthless. First off why do I need a app to book a redelivery. Secondly why do I need a app to book a delivery that can't even work.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 21:30:42__

> Absolutely shocking that an app of this quality has been released by Royal Mail. This would fail as a GCSE Computing project, it is that bad.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 17:14:12__

> Absolutely Rubbish, constant error message trying to book a redelivery.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 21:06:47__

> Terrible, wanted to pick up a parcel I missed while at work, went after work the next day since Google and their website said they were open but no. After calling them THE ONLY WAY TO TELL IF THEY WERE OPEN WAS BY DOWNLOADING THE APP SIGHNING UP AND CHECKING THAT WAY. Now I try to get onto the app again it refuses to allow me to do anything unless I go onto the website and scan a QR code. How the hell can royal mail think this is acceptable during covid, update your times on google.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 20:47:54__

> It's unacceptable to make you download an app to use their redelivery service. The app crashed multiple times and was very slow when trying to sort the redelivery as well so its not fit for purpose. You want people to stay home, well let them organise on the website, or at the very least get some better programmers.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 16:55:03__

### Description

It provides ways to pay bills, sign up for recreation activities, call departments with one click, as well as Live Video feeds from many traffic cameras throughout the city. Through GPS maps, users of the app will be able to find their way to many official City offices, parks, and other locations. When looking for something to do, a calendar has events with the ability to have push notifications with instant alerts on crime, traffic, events, and more.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | City of Corona |
| **Website**  | [http://www.discovercorona.com](http://www.discovercorona.com) |
| **Email** | Brittanyr@ci.corona.ca.us |
| **Physical address**  | [400 S Vicentia Ave Suite 310 Corona, CA 92882](https://www.google.com/maps/search/400%20S%20Vicentia%20Ave%20Suite%20310%20Corona,%20CA%2092882) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=City+of+Corona) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> The ALHOSN UAE app is the official COVID-19 testing channel for health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, by the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
<br>By using the app, everyone can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep their family and friends safe.
<br> 
<br>You can receive your COVID-19 test results directly on your phone with a unique QR code that is proof of your status and that of everyone else around you who also have the app, giving you peace of mind that you can safely interact.
<br>The app can also help trace people who may have come within close proximity to confirmed COVID-19 cases for an extended period of time. It uses short-distance Bluetooth signals to determine when your phone is near another phone that also has the app installed.  Both phones exchange anonymized IDs which are then stored in encrypted form on your phone. Using the anonymized IDs, health authorities can quickly identify and contact people at risk of infection so they can be retested.
<br> 
<br>Put your health in your hands with 3 easy steps:
<br>1.      Download the ALHOSN UAE app
<br>2.      Authenticate with your Emirates ID and phone number
<br>3.      Turn on Bluetooth and push notifications on your smartphone
<br> 
<br>Download the ALHOSN UAE app today and share it with your family and friends.
<br>Together, we can stop the spread of COVID-19
<br>Safer Together.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |

| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> The latest update is unstable (frequently hanging) and also no longer shows how many days have past since the last testing date. With the previous version, the user/inspector can easily see how many days have passed since the last COVID19 test. In latest version, if you access the result after some time (4 days in my experience) it will just say "Negative - Expired".

> Please give us a volume control for that dreadful siren<br> :date: __2020-09-26 15:13:11__

> Well after not bothering to log on much over the summer due to never being called on, I received an email saying more people were needing help. Plus I felt I should do something to say thank you for early access to the Track and Trace app. I logged on half an hour ago and just had my first call! She's already received help from a neighbour but was very grateful for the call.<br> :date: __2020-09-25 11:51:16__

> The app work good. But the notification siren (which I am not able to change) puts me off. Think about a loud siren in the middle of a restaurant, quite house/work place. Ability to choose between a couple of notification tones/ringtones will be of great help. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-08-20 12:13:07__

> Seems to work fine, gives plenty of information. Has been disappointing the number of requests that have come through though. Maybe it is a good thing and very few locals need support during the Pandemic.<br> :date: __2020-07-01 14:54:44__

> I have had alerts, accepted job, contacted person and yes help required. Rang surgery for collection of prescription and was already collected. Some time previous, so why had alert come through after collection. Needs more info as to progression of job. i.e Accepted, collected, delivered maybe?

> Good app but siren way too loud, it's driving my neighbour mad ! Apart from that, as others say here, 90% of people I ring have no idea why I rang, or how or why somebody put them on list. That needs addressing . On top of that some of the alerts are days old ,their prescription or shopping done days ago.Im becoming a bit disheartened wasting my time every day. I'm more than happy to run around for folks but less happy with wasted calls<br> :date: __2020-11-19 16:11:24__

> Doesn't work. I try to register using my St John certificate and the swirl of doom just spins foreverrrrrrrr; by which I mean 20 minutes over WiFi. Was able to register via the Web then log in to the app. But app registration just did not work.<br> :date: __2020-11-17 22:19:48__

> I've responded a couple of times to find that the chat request was for the previous day and had been dealt with? Embarrassing and unnecessary and the siren is excruciating why not a special phone sound kinder on the ears<br> :date: __2020-11-03 13:24:23__

> The app is ok however this Sunday I received 6 requests in quick succession. All bar one needed no help, and most requests I get end up being no help needed. My main criticism of the app is that once an alert comes in it sets my notification volume to max. I don't want or need to be notified each time normal messages come in which is why it is set to mute. Please can you make sure the app doesn't change my notification settings<br> :date: __2020-10-09 21:17:20__

> I am getting alerts but am unable to accept or reject them, have reinstalled app as advised by volunteer helpline & this has made no difference.<br> :date: __2020-10-02 15:18:13__

> App works well, though it does not always record your time. Cannot make contact with any app designers to help resolve the problem. Tried a re-install but it didn't help.<br> :date: __2020-08-20 14:13:43__

> Always crashes for no apparent reason. Had no alerts in thousands of hours. Crash report sent<br> :date: __2020-08-16 21:21:10__

> Worked perfectly before the update.<br> :date: __2020-08-05 18:58:39__

> Tempremental, freezes on occasions?<br> :date: __2020-08-05 17:55:09__

> Only just come back to the app...but now i know why I deleted it! The siren is just too loud! I have to have my phone on silent now to stop it going off. I can understand why it was there during the apps initial use, for first responders calling to medical emergencies, but check in and chats or collecting groceries and prescriptions are hardly medical emergencies that need to be completed that precise minute. I cannot have my phone on silent constantly, so think I will have to delete it again...<br> :date: __2020-11-10 10:38:35__

> Goodsam can u explain as to WHY today their was a serious cardiac arrest which happened litrally 2mins from where i live....why wasnt the alarm raised and i could of potentially saved this old gents life,but because nobody knew were the nearest defibrillator was,by time ambulance etc got to him he had passed away...This absolutely breaks my heart because i could of saved this gent potential, but was not alerted.....its a disgrace really is....<br> :date: __2020-11-04 00:24:36__

> When volunteering in SE London I get a lot of requests which are 4-8miles away. This is too far in a city and unnecessary given the number of volunteers that must be available (e.g 15 within a few hundred yards of me). I therefore waste a lot of time with the siren continually blarring and rejecting 9 out of ten requests before accepting a request within a reasonable distance. It should be easy add a setting so that requests beyond a certain distance are not referred.<br> :date: __2020-10-21 17:04:53__

> App is obviously for a good cause, but I keep signing myself out as off duty to avoid the ear splitting notifications (which are unaffected by muting your phone) 3x a minute for requests that are way out of my range. Needs location restrictions and notification adjustments ASAP!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 16:46:43__

> I don't seem to be the only one having trouble with the app. Firstly, the alarm is ear splitting, is there any way to turn it down please? I've just called a lady (I only do chats, as I'm stuck in too) she had no idea what it was all about, & didn't know why I was calling. I've had this before, but I chatted with her anyway, and she was ok. Also, I've been logging in 9-5 every day bar Sun, since lockdown started, but my hours are stuck on 388 and never change. This doesn't show all I've done.<br> :date: __2020-10-14 16:32:01__

> App is OK apart from: (1) the ear splitting siren which I've now turned off by going into the Responder settings via my phones Apps option. The downside is I mow miss most requests! Need an alternative noise. (2) I didn't sign up for chats (I'm rubbish at them) so either don't send them (most requests are chats) or enable me to see what the request is so I can decline if its chat. At the moment the alert does not indicate what its about. Until changes made the app remains set to Off Duty.<br> :date: __2020-10-09 16:21:58__

I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.

### Description
> Campus is the Airbus app that helps you quickly locate where you are and what is around you whilst visiting an Airbus site. The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the “world icon” to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Airbus Group |
| **Website**  | [http://www.airbus.com](http://www.airbus.com) |
| **Email** | support.campus@airbus.com |
| **Physical address**  | [B02 Building 2, rond-point Dewoitine, BP 90112 31703 Blagnac Cedex - FRANCE](https://www.google.com/maps/search/B02%20Building%202,%20rond-point%20Dewoitine,%20BP%2090112%2031703%20Blagnac%20Cedex%20-%20FRANCE) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Airbus+Group) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** |

<br>Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.
<br>Active 10s are simple to fit into your day. From taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lots of opportunities to introduce brisk walking into your daily routine.
<br>This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.
<br>If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to oneyou@phe.gov.uk.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Public Health England Digital |
| **Website**  | [http://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10](http://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

</p>

> I've persevered with the app and it improved to 5 star standard. It was used in conjunction with a Fitbit; they gave comprehensive information together, particularly when used for backpacking or trying new walks. Unfortunately the comprehensive output of the original, where you could see where active minutes were lost due to using gates, stiles bogs etc., has been replaced with a trophy icon for every 10 mins that reduces it usefulness quite considerably, without losing its core purpose.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 10:23:10__

> Very useful and encouraging to exercise.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 09:53:41__

> Wonderful software.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 15:42:45__

> Motivating to move. This app allows me to track how much brisk walking I've done without any kerfuffle. And keeps a record so I can see day by day week by week.<br> :date: __2020-11-20 16:45:16__

> Helps me stay on track<br> :date: __2020-11-17 13:41:04__

> Very useful. It has helped my husband immensely to recover from a heart attack in our first lockdown. As he could not have proper rehab at hospital, his recovery was very much in his hands with just telephone consults as guidance. He could track how much of his walking was brisk and improve in a sensible and safe timeframe as dictated by the hospital.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 13:12:22__

> Clear and not fussy.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 09:32:11__

> I have a problem with pedestrian crossings as I have to pause which makes it hard to do 10 minutes without stopping<br> :date: __2020-11-09 22:26:43__

> Good at recording brisk walks but overestimates normal walking. New edition much more accurate.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:23:28__

> It's quite motivating but doesn't differentiate between e.g. walking up a really steep hill and walking on a flat smooth path.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 13:16:45__



#### 3-star reviews

<p align="center">

</p>

> OK ish<br> :date: __2020-11-19 17:11:19__

> If you exceed your target the app doesn't recognise that and tells you 'keep going' for the target.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:42:09__

> Loads quicker than the earlier version, but otherwise inferior. Needs to allow more than 30 minutes as a target, also appears to under-record brisk walking.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 18:47:51__

> 9 November 2020: it works better than it used to, except I keep getting messages to update, I click the update button but the update doesn't happen. So annoying. Still, this app got me walking, and I've got healthier because of it.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 11:15:39__

> Active 10 just did an update and got rid of all my walks! Very annoying<br> :date: __2020-11-05 14:23:04__

> Why does it ask, every time it starts, to get the latest updates, when it has the latest version?? It'll be removed if it continues to annoy me.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 10:02:55__

> It is a good, useful and simple tracker. I like the use of time. Would prefer if it allowed you to set higher targets but it's good enough for me. I gave it 4 stars when I left that review but for some reason it now asks to be updated every day!! I reinstalled it to try and stop this but it wiped all my data! So now downgrading to 3 stars.<br> :date: __2020-11-02 20:04:34__

> Very useful for motivating me to exercise more. Clear and easy to use. Results are presented in a clear way. Sometimes the notifications get lost. Update November 2020: for the last few weeks it's been asking me to update every time I open it. Also reported by other users. Any plans to fix this issue?<br> :date: __2020-11-01 13:43:54__

> It used to be much better. Recently it has been telling me lies about my walking which it did on a previous version but I thought had been fixed. Such a shame. Also why does it ask me to update every single time I open it now?<br> :date: __2020-10-30 10:08:52__

> The latest version of this app is, in my opinion, inferior to its predecessor. It seems to have bugs and is less accurate in tracking brisk walking. Disappointing.<br> :date: __2020-10-18 18:48:02__

> It does not work offline and i hate that<br> :date: __2020-11-17 08:29:56__

> App needs tweaking. Just walked for 25 mins app says 8 mins active that's all, not recorded the other 17 mins at all, I know phone senser is working as samsung health has recorded correctly. Also it can't add up,yesterday the daily "today" says I've done "32" mins of brisk walking then tells me I've NEARLY achieved 3 x10min awards, but it shows 3 gold cups. I also get fed up of it asking me to "update" everytime I open the app, if I choose "ok" there is clearly no new update<br> :date: __2020-11-13 12:01:01__

> I like the app, it's simple and tells me exactly what I need to know. But the latest version keeps prompting to update, very annoying!!<br> :date: __2020-11-08 20:04:35__

> Keeps telling me an update is available. As far as I can tell Ihave already downloaded it<br> :date: __2020-11-05 13:45:47__

> Very basic, but good enough. Been using for a year now and no major problems. A few extra features would make it more useful, but then I guess complexity could compromise the quality and reliability. UPDATE: New version is buggy. It keeps saying there is an update when I am on the latest.<br> :date: __2020-11-05 10:13:24__

> App does not give distance travelled, constantly reminds about an update but if you try to update your taken to the option to download same version as already installed. Not good.<br> :date: __2020-10-23 23:50:09__

> Doesn't register cycling big disappointment,wants to update every time I open the app.<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:45:49__

> Seems a bit hit and miss since upgrade, probably by Serco. 2 people did same walk and it registers 130 mins for 1 and 237 for the other ??!<br> :date: __2020-10-17 01:08:09__

> 1850's patronising user interface<br> :date: __2020-10-09 08:02:49__

> Third time losing my progress data. I've been using app for several years and check it many times a day to see how I'm doing. (I preferred your older format which showed how much/what time each walk consisted of). No response to queries about moving my several years of data to new android mobile. (Data had previously been lost from my old mobile and took ages for me to get it reinstated.<br> :date: __2020-10-07 08:50:27__

> I only have a 26inch leg so my strides are short, to get it to register as a brisk walk on this app i had to jog for the10min<br> :date: __2020-11-18 12:46:23__

> Previous version was very good and accurate. Walk the same route at the same speed. Previous version 20 minutes brisk new version 5 minutes brisk. Going to uninstall. It is a waste of time.<br> :date: __2020-11-10 20:57:41__

> Since I've updated a few weeks ago, it's just not logging anything. Just keeps giving me an annoying 'oops' message.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 21:59:28__

> Walked very briskly for 40 minutes, and this App didn't register a single movement. It worked well for about two weeks. Very disappointed. Don't bother with this App.<br> :date: __2020-11-09 18:02:58__

> Not working.. constant update ..walking speed faulty..someone has being adjusting the app parameters.. brilliant app the way it was (pre Nov 20)<br> :date: __2020-11-09 10:09:06__

> Keep getting update pop up even though it has been updated to latest version!!<br> :date: __2020-11-02 22:49:36__

> Normally good but lately it wants to constantly update despite my changing settings on my phone. Very annoying.<br> :date: __2020-11-01 09:25:30__

> Stopped working - had been great - but all old walks lost, isnt tracking any walks just keeps saying loading or cant upload data. Nothing on the app in FAQ or help Shame as it was a useful app before it stopped working.<br> :date: __2020-10-25 11:50:05__

> Does not record brisk walking, I was almost running and it didn't record it as 'brisk'.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 23:06:28__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Innovatise GmbH |
| **Website**  | [http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure](http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/leisure) |
| **Email** | leisuremembership@rctcbc.gov.uk |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | Fuller and Forbes Healthare |
| **Website**  | [http://www.bramleyonline.co.uk](http://www.bramleyonline.co.uk) |
| **Email** | bramley.village@nhs.net |
| **Physical address**  | [Fuller and Forbes Healthcare Bramley Village Health and Wellbeing Centre Highfield Road Bramley Leeds LS13 2BL](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Fuller%20and%20Forbes%20Healthcare%20Bramley%20Village%20Health%20and%20Wellbeing%20Centre%20Highfield%20Road%20Bramley%20Leeds%20LS13%202BL) (Google Maps) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.1.x (API level 16) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

### Description
> 💚 Order repeat prescriptions to your door
<br>💚 Book GP appointments
<br>💚 View your GP medical record and carry it in your pocket
<br>💚 Discover your Wellness Score and get practical insights into your wellbeing
<br>💚 Build your most accurate health record
<br><b>NHS-ASSURED GP ONLINE SERVICES</b>
<br>Available at all GP practices in England:
<br>• Save yourself time by booking and cancelling GP appointments ⏰
<br>• Order your repeat prescriptions directly to your door, so you’re never without your medication 🚚 💊
<br>• Stay informed with 24/7 access to your GP medical record, including test results, immunisations, allergies and medications 📁
<br><b>ONE HEALTH RECORD. WHEN YOU NEED IT</b> 
<br>It may come as a surprise but a central record of your health doesn’t exist - your GP, hospital and other healthcare records aren’t joined up and information is not necessarily shared between them. That can make things pretty tricky, having to remember important information from memory, and explain past treatments and conditions over and over. With Evergreen Life, you can be in control and keep all your health data, including all of your GP records, in the palm of your hand - building a fully accurate and up-to-date record that you can carry with you all the time.
<br><b>WHAT’S YOUR WELLNESS SCORE?</b>
<br>Your Wellness Score can help you understand if you’re doing all you can to stay well. The score is based on your answers to the app’s clinically-researched Wellness Checks in areas such as fitness, happiness, sleep and diet. By discovering your Wellness Score, you’ll get personalised and practical insights into ways you can optimise your health and wellbeing.
<br><b>MEDICATION REMINDERS</b>
<br>Give yourself one less thing to worry about. Never forget to take your medications again with the Evergreen Life medicine app, helping you safely manage your own or your family’s health 💊
<br><b>HEALTH AND FITNESS TRACKER</b>
<br>Track your health and fitness measurements, including blood pressure, body fat percentage and blood sugar levels, so you can monitor your health goals 🏋️‍♂️🤸‍♂️
<br><b>SECURELY STORE YOUR DOCUMENTS</b>
<br>If you struggle to find appointment letters or your health information is difficult to manage, storing all your documents in one app can make it much easier to organise your care 📩
<br><b>SHARE WITH THOSE WHO MATTER MOST</b>
<br>Get the best care possible and give peace-of-mind to your family or health providers with secure access to your shared health information.
<br> 
<br><b>DNA TESTING: UNLOCK YOUR HEALTH SECRETS</b> 🤫
<br>With Evergreen Life DNA testing, you can find out how your genes influence your:
<br>• DIET - Fuel your body with the nutrition it needs
<br>• METABOLISM - Understand what foods will help you feel healthiest
<br>• FITNESS - Achieve better fitness results, faster
<br>• SKIN - Personalise your beauty routine by what your skin needs

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.1 (API level 22) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

> Quite a good app. All your medical info in one place. Only problem is when I send a message, no matter what it's about, I only get 'null' as a reply which isn't very helpful.<br> :date: __2020-11-19 12:17:35__

> Useful!<br> :date: __2020-11-06 23:06:27__

> Update 07-04: Originally gave this app 5 stars then after an update, it didn't work, so reduced the rating. Since 7th April I have had no issues and it seems to be working fine. Just hope this continues. UPDATE 15 Oct: Have decided to use another app, although I have to say there were only a few problems. Trouble is I don't need problems. When you're ordering meds, you want it to be plain sailing and simple. I would tentatively recommend this app but it has to work without hiccups. Thanks<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:01:41__

> I have been using same from almost the first week.off course when you first released the app it had one or two problems, then again which new release does not have problems. Seen a couple of comments saying difficult to understand.all I can say is that they must have a different program open to me.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 22:29:16__

> Could you let me lnow how yo record fitness results<br> :date: __2020-09-29 11:05:21__

> So much easier than waiting on hold to book an appointment :). However, parts of the interface can be confusing at times and hard to navigate. I can imagine it being difficult if you aren't tech savvy.<br> :date: __2020-09-10 12:03:38__

> Have used for a while now and found it very useful, however, recently it has stopped connecting to the server. Does anyone know the cause or have a fix?<br> :date: __2020-08-20 21:30:04__

> I can use this on my phone and laptop. This is useful.<br> :date: __2020-08-02 08:27:46__

> Edit: Although I still have no idea why I couldn't log in last time, the app is now working perfectly. It is very useful to be able to order a repeat prescription and to see medical records. Much easier than trying to get through to the surgery by phone. Evergreen Customer Services were very helpful! I installed the app on my phone but it just keeps scrolling through the 5 introductory screens and won't let me log in. It's a really good idea but no use if it's not reliable.<br> :date: __2020-08-01 14:05:06__

> Getting to know the app... How do I view photos of appointment letters I have taken? I can see the thumbnails, but can't open them?<br> :date: __2020-07-15 08:49:26__

> Edit: this is working again now - but only on my old phone (which is too knackered to sell so ok). My new phone runs colorOS, (realme6), which might have something to do with it. Disney+ doesn't work on it because of this... Edit: I can't get to the bit where you order a precriotion. It just buffers endlessly. 4/5/2020 Works well for me.<br> :date: __2020-11-23 08:25:52__

> good but needs improving<br> :date: __2020-11-22 13:36:15__

> I would like to see my records but they don't seem to be available<br> :date: __2020-11-20 14:19:30__

> Frustrating after the last update it constantly asks for the screen lock code making it very difficult to get access to the app. Is anyone else having trouble<br> :date: __2020-11-13 10:04:33__

> User experience inconsistent, lota if data not available from practition<br> :date: __2020-10-14 14:23:14__

> App is fine but biometric finger scan never worked.<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:52:10__

> Not the best to get the information I need<br> :date: __2020-10-13 20:08:20__

> Works in a basic way but it relies on your GP practice to provide a lot of the connections to other info, which in my case they don't. Also the biometric log in does not work now. It did work to start with, but although it says Fingerprint recognised it cannot log me in?<br> :date: __2020-09-23 19:54:52__

> Can't even login. The linkage number given by my practice is 13 characters (double checked many times) but the app it insists it should be 15!<br> :date: __2020-09-04 13:52:41__

> I've been using this app for quite a while now & l haven't had any issues until this morning & now it's saying its unable to log me in. None of my details have changed its seem since there was an update that its happened. Any chance someone can reply to this to help me out.<br> :date: __2020-08-25 12:52:35__

> biometric logon does not work, and last whole would not order my prescription<br> :date: __2020-11-22 12:22:00__

> Prescription function issues when trying to order. Galaxy S10. Used to work fine, now all but useless to me.<br> :date: __2020-11-08 15:03:43__

> I will leave this rating as '2' as a warning to other potential users that there is an issue. ie that sometimes the App stops recognising your password and that, despite their best endeavours and lots of communications between us, Evergreen Life have not been able to resolve this issue. Hopefully one day they will get to the bottom of it as it is otherwise a pretty good App (and the Web access is good) but there are I know other similar Apps available that are probably worth looking at first.<br> :date: __2020-10-24 11:10:45__

> Having major problems with your app it keeps logging me out I then have to reset my password this has happened twice in a week it's completely unusable now and I can't order my meds really really bad...<br> :date: __2020-10-17 08:38:12__

> This was a good App till it started promoting Pharmacy2u right in the App when we were going through the first Covid peak. Unfortunately I opted for that which never worked out and I had to switch back to my old pharmacy. Since then this App continues to update repeats in a haphazard manner repeatedly bringing up the same data when I request repeats. It is sad that after a long time I am uninstalling it. Business should never be given precedence to the core functions of people using this App.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 11:09:34__

> The app worked fine up until very recently where now I can't do anything in it and the buttons are unresponsive. The Customer Service team recommended reinstalling the app but this did nothing.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 09:19:19__

> Extraordinary initial interface, more like a game for the sharp eyed than a practical aid for those in pain or in a hurry. 'Playful" with tiny print. I suppose you'd get used to it.<br> :date: __2020-10-06 01:08:43__

> Okay when it works, which is not very often.<br> :date: __2020-09-28 09:38:54__

> This app was good, but now can't log on it just goes through the introduction screen its annoying as its the easiest way I order my prescriptions. Can you please fix...<br> :date: __2020-07-31 10:53:50__

> Unable to add more than one medication, and when doing the well being test despite selecting the never smoked option, it the asked questions about how many cigarettes I smoked a day. So not intuitive software. I ended up deleting<br> :date: __2020-06-26 17:47:02__

> don't look at the comments part. sends permissions to wrong place.<br> :date: __2020-11-22 10:43:26__

> AVOID THIS USELESS APP This app is nothing but logging users out, doesn't accept complex passwords, unlinks your GP account and then loads up half the time without any styling. Update 2020 Just just as useless in 2019 but now with 100% more notifications to drive you up the wall. Anything I try to do on this non-functioning app it just crashes. The NHS services are also tucked away making GP services harder to find and use.<br> :date: __2020-11-21 13:03:16__

> Unable to use finger print to log in. Have reset print numerous times and accepted by app - then won't allow print to be used for log on . Amateur Time<br> :date: __2020-11-20 19:51:20__

> Absolutely pants. It was fine originally but for the last year or so it freezes making it useless to me. Reloaded many times to no avail - time for me to move on.... No - I can't be bothered to ring customer services - it's an app - it doesn't work on my old phone or my new phone - plenty of alternatives out there.... Avoid.<br> :date: __2020-11-04 20:26:56__

> Absolute rubbish.I cant even opt out of automatic updates.When I try and update the app, it just says "waiting on download." It won't let me use the app unless I complete the update so now I am stuck.Absolutely stupid way to design an app.Useless!!!!!<br> :date: __2020-10-31 18:14:42__

> Atrocious app. Won't let me log in when I know 100% that my credentials are correct. When I click to reset the password, it does nothing. How can we ever log in then?!? Awful.<br> :date: __2020-10-15 15:30:51__

> Only wanted to make doctor's appointment. Too many extras. Are they mining data?<br> :date: __2020-10-13 21:02:41__

> My phone has facial recognition: does this app? No, don't be silly. It's all in a Google Security API that no 'developer' is able to understand yet. Agree about the interface; it is very poorly thought out. And it's not about me, is it? It's about selling services. Don't you just hate what's happening with our NHS?<br> :date: __2020-10-13 19:25:24__

> Finger print password does not work and it's the default setting<br> :date: __2020-10-08 10:11:52__

> This app is truly awful. Half the buttons don't even work, constantly logs you out and won't allow you to log in again. I've ended up having to use their website instead, which is also awful. If you're looking for an app to connect to your practice, for the love of God don't use this one. 1 star because I can't give it negative stars<br> :date: __2020-10-08 09:50:31__

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Website**  | [http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus](http://edge.oxnet.nhs.uk/bump-plus) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | KitKat, version 4.4 - 4.4.4 (API level 19) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.
