## Data sources and analyses

The analysis of each app is structured around five main dimensions: 
* App metadata  
* Requested permissions
* Mentioned servers
* Androwarn analysis
* User ratings and reviews

In the following we describe the data sources and analysis performed for each dimension.

### App metadata

App metadata includes an overview of the main information about the app (for example, its name, releases, privacy policy, etc.), contact information of the development team, and the various Android versions supported by the app. This information is extracted from two main data sources:
* _Google Play store_: we automatically mined the web page of the Google Play store showing the basic information about the app and we parsed it in order to extract information about the app and development team 
* _Android Manifest file_: in our analysis we decompiled the binary file of the app (it is similar to a Zip archive but it contains the code of the app instead of normal files) and we extracted information about the supported Android versions, as it has been listed by its development team.

The extracted app metadata feeds the _App overview_, _Development team_, and _Android support_ sections of this report.
We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

### Requested permissions

The Android operating system has a permission model which allows users to grant access to potentially privacy-related information. Every Android app has to explictly declare the permissions it needs to properly function in the Android Manifest file.  

In this report we also show the protection level of each permission, which is a key information for understanding how the requested permissions related to the user's privacy. We carefully analyzed the [official Android documentation (v. 29)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission), and it resulted that a permission requested by an Android app can belong to the following protection levels:
* **Dangerous**: higher-risk permissions that would give a requesting app access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system usually does not automatically grant it to the requesting app. For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an app may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding.
* **Normal**: this is the default and most common level in Android; normal permissions are lower-risk and give access to isolated app-level features, with minimal risk to other apps, the system, or the user. 
* **Signature**: permissions granted only if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app that declared the permission
* **Appop**: old permission level, a reminiscence of the App Ops tool that Google introduced in Android 4.3.
* **Development**: optional permissions which can be granted to development-oriented apps.
* **Privileged**: permissions who give higher power to mobile apps w.r.t. other apps, such as binding to incoming calls, interacting via bluetooth with other devices without user interaction, etc.
* **Preinstalled**: reserved only for preinstalled apps
* **Installer**: allow the holder to start the permission usage screen for an app
* **RetailDemo**: permissions related to devices used in demonstrations in shops.
* **Pre23**: permissions automatically granted to apps targeting devices running pre-6.0 Android.
* **Upcoming**: permissions which will be released in the next version of the Android platform. 
* **Deprecated**: permissions belonging to old releases of the Android platform, they should not be used by developers since they will not be supported in the near future.
* **Not for use by third-party applications**: permissions which can be requested only by apps developed by Google.
* **Undefined**: this protection level is not documented by Google.

The permissions dimension of this project is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool.

### Mentioned servers

We decompiled each app in order to look for all possible mentions of remote URLs. The mentioned URLs can refer to remote servers the the app is using for either sending or receiving information, web addresses for directing the user to an information website, and so on. 

:warning: It is important to note that this analysis is not meant to be complete and it is very prone to obfuscation. The servers reported here are simply _mentioned_ somewhere in the code of the app and are meant to just give an indication about the "hooks" of the app towards external resources. For example, for an Android app it is normal to contact Google services in order to send/receive push notifications, or to contact the servers of analytics services for having real-time diagnostics about crashes of the app or bugs.

This part of the analysis is based on the [Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) static analysis tool for identfying the raw URLs mentioned in the app; then, the information about each mentioned server is collected by performing a _whois_ lookup on the first-level domain present in the URL.

### Security analysis

This dimension is based on the [Androwarn](https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn) structural and data flow analysis of Android bytecode. Androwarn is developed by the University of Lyon/INSA (France) and it has been used in several academic studies. According to its documentation, Androwarn targets the following categories of potential security issues:
* **Telephony identifiers exfiltration**: IMEI, IMSI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CID, operator's name, etc.
* **Device settings exfiltration**: software version, usage statistics, system settings, logs, etc.
* **Geolocation information leakage**: GPS/WiFi geolocation, etc.
* **Connection interfaces information exfiltration**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth MAC adress, etc.
* **Telephony services abuse**: premium SMS sending, phone call composition, etc.
* **Audio/video flow interception**: call recording, video capture, etc.
* **Remote connection establishment**: socket open call, Bluetooth pairing, APN settings edit, etc.
* **PIM data leakage**: contacts, calendar, SMS, mails, clipboard, etc.
* **External memory operations**: file access on SD card, etc.
* **PIM data modification**: add/delete contacts, calendar events, etc.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: native code using JNI, UNIX command, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Denial of Service**: event notification deactivation, file deletion, process killing, virtual keyboard disable, terminal shutdown/reboot, etc.

Note: We do not consider this data point in the current version of our analyzers since it is too verbose for our purposes.

:warning: It is important to note that Androwarn is a static analysis tool, and as such it performs a variety of heuristics and approximations in its analyses. Said that, the results shown in this report are meant to provide an indication of _potential_ security issues and should be by no means treated as complete and correct.   

### User ratings and reviews

For this dimension we turn again to the web interface of the Google Play store. Firstly, we automatically mine summary statistics about user ratings from the web page of the app under analysis; then, we automatically download the newest 1000 reviews of the app under analysis. For each level of rating (5 stars, 4 stars, , etc., 1 star) we show:
- a word cloud presenting the main terms used by end users in their reviews in the Google Play store
- the last 10 reviews provided by app users in the Google Play store. 

This purposefully simple analysis is meant to help both future users and the development team of the app in understanding what are the main positive and negative points of the app under analysis.

We make use of the [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper) tool for extracting the raw data related to this dimension of the project.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | World Health Organization |
| **Website**  | [https://www.who.int/](https://www.who.int/) |
| **Email** | dcx@who.int |
| **Physical address**  | [Avenu Appia 20 1211 Geneva Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Avenu%20Appia%2020%201211%20Geneva%20Switzerland) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=World+Health+Organization) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Jelly Bean, version 4.2.x (API level 17) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app. 

| **Permission** | **Protection level** | **Description** | 
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
 **android.permission<br>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | Normal | Allows applications to access information about networks. 
 **android.permission<br>INTERNET** | Normal | Allows applications to open network sockets. 
 **android.permission<br>READ_CALENDAR** | :warning:**Dangerous** | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| **Developer**  | Dave at Ryecroft Community Hub & BITS |
| **Website**  | [http://www.ryecroftnrc.org](http://www.ryecroftnrc.org) |
| **Email** | david.taylor@ryecroftnrc.org |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Pie, version 9 (API level 28) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Eclair, version 2.1 (API level 7) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

As for the risk of malware, some of the more rudimentary so-called security apps will throw up false positives but Kaspersky, AVG and Malwarebytes will not. 🏳<br> :date: __2020-05-02 18:01:23__

### Description
> Overview
<br>The COVIDCare NI app has been developed by Digital Health and Care NI in partnership with Health & Social Care, the Public Health Agency and the Department of Health.
<br>The app has been designed to help the public in Northern Ireland keep up to date with the latest advice on the COVID-19 pandemic, helping you to:
<br>Check if you or someone in your household has coronavirus symptoms.
<br>Access personalised advice based on your answers to the symptom check questions.
<br>Decide if you need clinical advice and how to access it.
<br>Easily find links to trusted information resources on COVID-19 advice and mental health resources.
<br>Self-isolate if you have symptoms by checking the self-isolation timer for both yourself and your household.
<br>Search current advice by using a search function of FAQs.
<br>We continue to update the app with new features based on feedback from citizens in Northern Ireland and will continue to ensure app users get access to the most up to date headlines and changes in the advice and guidance.
<br>Things are moving quickly with the pandemic so you may need to come back to refresh your app regularly. We’ll let you know when this is necessary.
<br>Thank you for your support in helping us project your family, friends and community.
<br>Why use the app?
<br>The app is available for use in Northern Ireland to all individuals who are currently residing in Northern Ireland.
<br>Data Security
<br>The app does not collect any personally identifiable information.
<br>We will collect information related to the postcode and age of the user to help us track the impact of COVID-19 in Northern Ireland.
<br>This will help us to plan services and ensure that resources are directed to the areas of greatest need.

> I don't live in NI, and I don't have any covid symptoms but I was curious to see how this app worked, so I used an NI postcode and 'role-played'. This is great; clear and concise, with efficient links through to local health service info. We could definitely benefit from an app like this in mainland UK. Hats off to the developers! To those giving 1 star reviews, I note many of you do not live in NI & did not notice that the app was, therefore, not designed for you!!!<br> :date: __2020-05-27 19:31:24__

> Seems promising at first glance, easy to use with good range of features. It also let's you use the app on behalf of someone else which might be good for elderly/and or the less technical, visually impaired or less able bodied. What accessibility features does it conform to? One issue I had was when I filled in the symptom checker flow. The last stage presents a blank yellow screen and it's not intuitive that you have to close or go back to see suggestions<br> :date: __2020-07-30 18:59:15__

### Description
> OpenWHO is the World Health Organization's (WHO) interactive knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. OpenWHO enables the Organization and its key partners to transfer life-saving knowledge to large numbers of frontline responders.
<br>With OpenWHO, you have the flexibility to learn at your convenience. Watch the short video lectures and test your knowledge with self-tests when and where you like. The course forum and the collaboration space allow you to get in touch with other participants and experts around the world.

<br>Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by disease outbreaks and health emergencies, or for those with a general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.
<br> 
<br>It features 6 channels:
<br>- The <b>Outbreak</b> channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
<br>- The <b>Ready for Response</b> channel helps prepare personnel who are training for deployment to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
<br>- The <b>Get Social</b> channel focuses on social science-based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
<br>- The <b>Preparing for Pandemics</b> channel brings together courses on various aspects of preparedness, including surveillance, public health measures and risk communication during a pandemic.
<br>- The <b>COVID-19</b> channel provides learning resources in WHO's 6 official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) for health professionals, decision-makers and the public for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
<br>- The <b>COVID-19 National Languages</b> channel provides the same learning resources as the COVID-19 channel but in national languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese and Portuguese. 
<br> 
<br>OpenWHO courses are available in many languages, including WHO's 6 official languages.

## Development team
In the following we report the main information provided by the development team in the Google play store.

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Developer**  | HPI Knowledge Engineering Team |
| **Website**  | [https://openwho.org/](https://openwho.org/) |
| **Email** | openwho-support@hpi.de |
| **Physical address**  | [Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3 14482 Potsdam](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Str.2-3%2014482%20Potsdam) (Google Maps) |
| **Other developed apps**  | [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=7185448023325736337) |

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | - |
| **Effective target Android version**  | - |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Lollipop, version 5.0 (API level 21) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems.

## Android support

| | |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Declared target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Effective target Android version**  | Android10, version 10 (API level 29) |
| **Minimum supported Android version**  | Marshmallow, version 6.0 (API level 23) |
| **Maximum target Android version**  | - |

The larger the difference between the minimum and maximum supported Android versions, the better. A larger difference means a wider audience. For example, old phones have a very low Android version, so a high minimum supported Android version means that the app cannot be used by users with old phones, thus leading to accessibility problems. 

## Requested permissions

In the following we report the complete list of the permissions requested by the app.

And keep up the good work in keeping family's safe from covid 19)and our health services safe to<br> :date: __2020-11-16 02:44:48__

> Does what it says on the tin.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 22:51:10__

> Very simple to use and having read many reviews (including those of the Which? Consumer organisation) I have no doubt that my data is entirely anonymous. Will this make a huge difference in fighting covid-19? Who knows but I am sure it will help and therefore I am sure that everyone with a smart phone really ought to be using it. Your fellow citizens deserve it.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:12:22__

> Very handy to see<br> :date: __2020-11-14 22:57:26__

> Nothing to say which I could print, as none of it would be accepted. Just a pity that various things could not have been done before now. No one's fault, we can all be wise after any event.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 17:29:25__

> I've been working on a hospital ward which now has covid cases should I self isolate as I've been in there rooms before they tested positive??<br> :date: __2020-11-16 08:12:41__

> Helpful<br> :date: __2020-11-15 22:13:51__

> A peace of mind good reminder<br> :date: __2020-11-14 12:58:24__

> Need improving you can't stay logged in location if you receive a phone call it automatically log you out.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 10:26:26__

> Thanks it was helpful<br> :date: __2020-11-14 09:35:16__

> Having to put Bluetooth on my phone all time, it kills the battery so u can't use it all time otherwise its a very helpful and let's u know when to isolate, like my neighbor..<br> :date: __2020-11-14 08:06:21__

> I have downloaded this but not been contacted so far. I think it's a bad idea to call people from 0345 numbers. Many of us deliberately avoid such calls as they may be cold callers.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 17:24:55__

> Overall, does it's job. I have moved to a new area and I can't figure out how to update my address as it's stuck on my old one.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 13:32:37__

> It looks like it's working, I've not had any notifications about isolating. The only downside is it doesn't have a check out so if you scan a qr code it leaves you logged in to that area until you either scan another qr code or until midnight. You might only be popping the shop for a pint of milk at 8am before going home for the day so your logged in as at the shop for 16 hours. I'd like to be able to check out even if I have to enter details manually.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 03:09:35__

> Kept telling me to put Bluetooth on, it was and still wouldn't work<br> :date: __2020-11-16 06:43:56__

> Why is it for people aged more than 16 Those under 16 are free-coronavirus ?!<br> :date: __2020-11-15 20:05:03__

> Ok the app<br> :date: __2020-11-15 15:01:54__

> I've had a notification to self isolate for 8 days this morning, but it didn't tell me where it was that I had been in contact with which is a bit crazy, because I have no idea who I was with at the time in order to notify them about it. Why doesn't it tell you where it was that you may have been in contact, surely its not that hard to do.......<br> :date: __2020-11-15 11:06:06__

> Don't think the close control exposure works when you're close to someone with covid19 as we have a positive result back from our house hold and my phone hasn't picked it up yet<br> :date: __2020-11-15 09:32:11__

> Edit: Absolutely slaughters your battery. I thought my phone was broken, down to 67% charge from 100% by 9am. Uninstalled and the next day my battery was still at 47% by 10pm! The sort of person who is selfish enough not to self isolate when needed to isn't likely to of bothered with downloading and using this app. Quite then why you've revealed that you'll share info with the police is beyond me. All you've done is hurt the success of the app and give the tin foil hat wearers an energy boost.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 07:42:42__

> Has not done for me since installation<br> :date: __2020-11-14 19:44:36__

> This is so unclear to use<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:54:35__

> Worked fine for a bit, but now crashes whenever I try to open it. Uninstalling and reinstalling has no effect. EDIT: So instead of improving the app to prevent crashes, I'm advised to update iOS to 14.2. On the Google Play store.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 09:38:32__

> I live with someone who tested positive for coronavirus but the app didn't notify me. I received an email from test and trace to tell me to isolate.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 01:40:43__

> I have been self isolate by test and trace for 10 days and if I get again exposed will be losing my job no thank you I have unstalled the app.<br> :date: __2020-11-15 23:50:57__

> Only wish there was a section to notify that my neighbours are having parties<br> :date: __2020-11-14 16:20:47__

> This app now keeps crashing (and my Pixel came up with a warning message saying it's constantly crashing). Can't currently even open the app. When it did previously work it was reasonable but the notifications are terrible. Please add a notification history section because it sends notifications and then you tap on them and see nothing but the normal screen in the app. It would be useful to be able to check Covid rates in other parts of the country, not just the area you've set as your home.<br> :date: __2020-11-14 10:36:16__

> The app on my Samsung S10 + has failed to update that I should self isolate after a household member has been tested positive?<br> :date: __2020-11-13 18:04:08__

> I can't really give it more. I have checked in all the places I go and then I get a little shield pop up on top of my screen but then it doesn't show me anything. Does this mean I've been safe all these months and trust it will pop up with full information of where I was if I did go near a stranger who has symptoms ? Also does this only work if the person/persons fills out the form properly because surely the app isn't that smart to predict who has the virus or at least showing symptoms ?<br> :date: __2020-11-13 16:12:54__

> I've not had any problems with the app technically. But going by how badly Test and Trace is going, there doesn't seem much point having the app. I do use it though, and I hope it will keep getting better. Edit: Thank you for your response. Although I don't find the app 'useful', it's something else to worry about. Its more that I just use it.<br> :date: __2020-11-13 16:02:54__

> Garbage, i travel the length of the uk working at service stations, staying in hotels, eating at restaurants and have been in contact with thousands of people in 7/8 months, and it has only notified me when i was at home one day saying someone nearby has symptoms, not being funny but that only appeared after my wife had a test (it was negative)<br> :date: __2020-11-13 11:34:04__

> Went to check the app and had to agree to T&C's again..then told there was 3 days left of my isolation. So missed 7 days. My girlfriands app won't even open. Utterly useless.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 10:14:51__

> app wont open. everytime i click on it nothing happens<br> :date: __2020-11-16 08:12:37__

> Utterly pointless I don't know anyone who is using this app. Every place I've ever gone to noone use using the app. So if it's only being used by a small small minority it makes it utterly pointless.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 06:12:18__

> It's a shame for kids because it's only for 16 year olds<br> :date: __2020-11-16 00:45:45__

> App on my Samsung note 10+ and girlfriends Samsung S9 stopped checking for exposure on the 28th October (both same date) only checked this as have been in contact with a covid positive person. Reinstalled app and its checking again. Im assuming id of got a notification which is now gone.<br> :date: __2020-11-16 00:23:12__
