        "Previously it worked well. However on the 9th dec an update has caused it to crash after the initial page to a white page on my tablet where previously it was fine. I'll reinstall and see what happens. 10\\12\\20. I reinstalled,cleared cache, behaved exactly the same I'm sorry to say. I have logged in since March for two people.",
        "This morning tried to log on but couldn't (blue screen only). Uninstallled/reinstalled on my Samsung phone but my email address not recognised. Tried to use different email address but app buttons don't work. I want to report daily but can't. A bit later - still wouldn't recognise original details but could managed to use a third email address to log on and to use the app/report. Problems solved. 10 Dec. Can't open app again. Have updated today but still won't open. Heading for nil star review!",
        "I'm lucky that i have not gotten sick yet, but I'm glad there's a community app like this to gather data for research. I think it will be a big help to combat covid. One minor criticism, the app shows the number of people who are exhibit like covid symptoms vs the total population of the county. Obviously not everyone in the population report how they're feeling...so it may make more sense to report how many people are showing symptoms vs the number of people that reported.",
        "Really simple app which has been working very well until about a week ago when an update meant that for both me and my partner the icon disappeared from the home screen on our Android phones, we had to log in again, and we have both stopped receiving any daily reminders. (I have checked that notifications are turned on in the app.) Other people seem to have the same problems, which will mean that many will forget to record their daily symptoms. I hope this can be fixed soon as this study has been invaluable.",
        "Great project and good app. My only small annoyance is that if you are reporting for several people (eg you and your kids) then you have to go back to the front page and scroll down to the report others button each time. I sometimes just report for me as it's easier.",
        "Good, but the app has now stopped working, and immediately goes to a white screen on start-up. Tried reinstalling, but the same problem occurs. Following a security update, the app now functions. I'm not convinced that the estimated figures are to be totally believed, as they fluctuate wildly for this area. I have assumed that the reason for this fluctuation is that students, for example, are identified as home-based, when they are in fact residing elsewhere (and getting infected there).",
        "I've been using this app for months and it's a fantastic thing. One cricism since the last update is that the number of cases in my area no longer appears along with the total number of UK cases and, instead, one must go and search for this information, deeper into the app/ZOE web pages. Can this be reinstated, please?",
        "Very good app, because it's amazingly simple (just two or three clicks and only a few seconds each time you use it) and it helps in the fight against Covid-19. But it does have one giant flaw (or maybe it's my phone, I haven't managed to figure it out) and that is that the alerts are ridiculously erratic. When the alerts don't work I'm unlikely to report. I just forget, sorry. This happens far too often. I once went for 24 days without reporting due to no alerts.",
        "Easy to use, but had to reinstall recently as app would not accept log-in information. Since then, the push notifications are not being received despite correct settings being used. This means there have been a few days missed, whereas I had no missed days prior to this happening. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be a common problem. Would be nice to have it rectified.",
        "Very easy to use. Daily reminder crucial. However for a couple of weeks I could not report because the daily link that was sent required a password which I didn't have and reset password wasn't working. Have also had to uninstall and reinstall the app a couple of times when it stopped responding. Just had a period of a couple of weeks (November) when no reminder sent and I had to log in to report.",
        "This is a good app, simple and quick to use, but I've had to re-install twice. Once because I changed my email provider and couldn't change it on here. Once the profile is set you can't change it. The second time it was because the app shut me out and then wouldn't accept my log in details. That is quit annoying. I wouldn't usually bother again but I think the app is important.",
        "The app was working perfectly for me right up until today. Now once the app loads the screen goes white and stops. Rather disappointing, as I haven't missed a day since the app began. I've even uninstalled and reinstalled and it still goes to a plain white screen.",
        "Fab app. Very quick and easy to use. Problem is that it's recently stopped showing reminders to log whether I have symptoms or not. I just struggle to remember to do this without a prompt. This is a recent fault on my phone but looking at other reviews, I think there might be a problem with the app as other's are reporting similar problems. I really enjoy this app and feel like I'm part of a big effort to track the virus. Please try to fix the issue soon. So many people are counting on you \ud83d\ude42",
        "Very good app, easy to use & navigate, with a wealth of very useful information. Would have given 5 stars & 'excellent' but once your profile is created, you cannot go in to update it. It was such a new app when I first installed & logged my personal info (for obvious reason), I was a little sceptical but realise its now wholly trusted & would feel OK about giving over additional details but am unable to do so. Instead, the only way to do this is start the whole process again. Er, no thanks.",
        "Great reporting app and an easy way to be able to request a covid-19 test if you report feeling unwell. Like the reminder to check in every day to remind me to do it but it stopped reminding me 3 days ago and as I just remembered I had not received reminders recently and as others have reported, it asked me to create a new account at first and then log in again, which I haven't had to do since March. Not sure what's going on guys!",
        "This has been a flawless 5 star app to me for months and months but there have been a couple of odd things recently. A while back, it stopped asking me weekly 'activity' questions without explanation. Just me or everyone? The other day it didn't automatically log me on, after an update presumably, and didn't send me a requested password reset, so I had to re-register to get back on. Otherwise the app and the thoughts and efforts on our behalf behind the scenes are definitely 5 star worthy.",
        "I have been doing daily updates with this app for months, recorded three tests with negative results, then when I came to fill in the daily report today, the icon for the app had disappeared. Tried to open it from the apps list, but it didn't recognize me, and wanted me to log in to an identity from 235 days ago. Where has my app gone with all the data recorded???",
        "Have been reporting since the very start but every day it says I haven't reported . Updated it as instructed and it said I hadn't logged on for 16 days! Started again to remind me to report when I have. Very frustrating. I'm in the North East where number of cases are large and so important that I report . Followed instructions after notification of problems re app but still reminds me to report about 1 hr after me having done so. Not sure if they are actually registering my reports!",
        "I have the same issue Patricia Trembath reported on 15/11/20. I've been using the app since March but today for the first time it was very slow loading and then asked me to login with a password. I input the password I know that I initially registered with. It \"can't identify me\". I used the password reset function (so I am obviously using the right email address). It still cant identify me.",
        "Of note, the number of people with symptoms this app reports is a lot more stable than test result numbers, and I personally trust the trends from this study (if not so much the number itself). It helps me to not get to complacent when test numbers go down, not too anxious when the test numbers go up. And it helps us learn more about how the virus spreads.",
        "Great app to report daily if you have any Covid-19 symptoms or have had any tests. I only have it 4 stars as it kept giving me yesterday's date. Had to contact customer services about it. I had to force quit the app. Afterwards I wouldn't get the daily reminders - because I needed to log in again. All a bit bothersome, but worth it to help scientists to track the spread of the illness.",
        "Used to be great and I felt good to be part of helping research. Unfortunately, about a week ago the app disappeared from my phone and I had to reinstall and login which I'd never done previously. And now, this new version doesn't remind me to report either so I quite often forget. Perhaps the Zoe team don't need my input anymore? Not too sure if it's worth keeping to be honest.",
        "Good app, quick and simple to use. Good to feel I'm doing something to help the research into the COVID 19 virus. Update 22.11.20 not getting daily reminder. Have checked notification settings and it is turned on but I see others are having the same issue. Also I'm not getting the weekly questionnaire any more, and haven't for some time. I don't know if that part of the research has ended, my contribution is not needed or it's a bug in the app and others are still getting it?",
        "Edit 15/11/2020: I'm very happy using the app to report every day, although I find notifications sometimes don't happen and I forget to report. Otherwise a great app! Edit: since my original feedback, the developer has fixed the issue, I got back onto the app and am finding it easy and quick to use. My only wish now is that it would notify me each day to report in, via the notification if possible. This is an easy, simple and effective app. I've recommended it to all my family.",
        "Very straight forward to put in your daily updates, especially while \"feeling physically normal\". Inputs are completely anonymous, the \"symptom tracking\" is at population level. Great to take part in such a valued citizen science project, recommend to anyone and everyone who can do it! It's one of several large scale surveys in use by public health experts and the more who participate in data gathering, the better we'll be able to understand disease transmission.",
        "Recently I have been unable to access the daily reporting system. Now I have spent some time trying, successfully at last, to report today but only by logging in, establishing a password and logging in again. Reporting now takes several minutes longer than previously. Why has reporting been made more complicated? Simplicity was its former great asset.",
        "I have been logging daily since April. I have found the information excellent. The only problem I have found is that I cannot access my account on some ocassions and so I can't log my information. Usually this corrects itself after a few days but today after a week of no access I have reset my password and been able to log my information.",
        "Today I had to log in for the first time since starting. Not sure why? Anyway, I used to get fed up answering the mask/outside time questions because I report for 3 people and we pretty much did the same every week . I like reading how the fight is going and what breakthroughs are being made. I used to like seeing our local figures but they are going up so quickly. Great app.",
        "This is a great app for signing in and reporting, however it would not let me change my location when i moved. Despite following all the instructions I now have to not report as myself anymore and open up as a friend, so that i can report from my new location. This is a glitch in the system that needs sorting out, as it should be easy to change location, but this is not the case.",
        "I've been using this app since March 2020, generally it's worked well, I've only had to reinstall it on one occasion. It's easy to use, the details provided are interesting and informative and offer a different and I feel more positive view of the Covid situation than the UK mainstream media do - with facts, but without the scaremongering!",
        "Used with no problems since start and would be 5 stars. However now when I log in I get a blank white screen. Have uninstalled and tried again and tried on different devices. I still can't get on . Account is still active as it wont let me create a new account with my email. This research has made useful contributions and I want to continue to help, but can't due to this glitch. Can we get it fixed?",
        "Feels good to be a part of this research, to get an insight into local covid rates and identify hotspots. It was thanks to this app that I got tested; they asked me to despite not having \"classic\" symptoms and my result was positive. I wouldn't have known or suspected otherwise. Its only downside is that the daily rates in my area recently have fluctuated wildly and this makes it harder to understand. Presumably people don't always report every day which affects this.",
        "Would be useful to have a reminder to complete the app daily. Also, once completed, that the app does not allow you to report a second time. Sometimes I cannot remember if I have completed it, so may have done so twice for a few days. SORTED Now as realise that once you log in it tells you how many days ago your last report was.",
        "Initially, I was surprised at how much personal information it wanted...height, weight etc, but then I remembered that it is gathering data about people, related to vulnerability to Covid, and being overweight or obese, is relevant. It is a bit of a bind, to do it every day, as I am disabled and very ill with chronic illnesses, so have many of the Covid type symptoms on a daily basis anyway, but it if you feel \"normal\" for you, then you only have to click on 2 boxes, so it's very quick.",
        "Good to help with the study but app is flakey. Does not always save the data. Loaded app today and tells me it's 3 days since I reported although I did each day! It would be good to get a positive confirmation that data entered has been confirmed as saved. Update. Still same problems but after update last night it is unusable as when it loads you end up with a whit screen!",
        "Good app, happy to provide my data in this way, however like others I haven't reported for a few days due to the app updating and logging me out. Perhaps before the next update that might cause a logout, an email could be sent to remind us to log back in? Keep up the good work though. Resetting passwords is slow but DOES work. Give it time! After logging back in all my data remains. Patience, people!",
        "This ap was very useful. It was easy to use until 3 days ago. Then it took me to a page requiring information about periods and then a second screen about HRT use. I filled in both screens successively, but the app refused to allow me to complete the daily screen about my own health. Despite REPEATED ATTEMPTS, it just kept returning to these 2 \"new\" screens and would NOT allow me access to the main health (\"are you ok\") screen. Help!",
        "This app usually works well. Sometimes it gets stuck and freezes and yesterday I couldn't access the site and had to log in again. This hasn't happened before and I have been using the app since March/April. There is usually a daily email reminder to check-in but this hasn't happened for the last three days. Generally it has been an easy app to use.",
        "Unfortunately has become worse with recent releases - one logged out users with no notification, meaning a good chunk of users has probably been lost who didn't notice they weren't getting them any more. The current version also doesn't open the app on tapping the notification, making it less seamless to report than before. The lack of a 'send'/'submit' button makes it unclear when a report has been completed. Could use this consistency, particularly given it needs to maintain good sample sizes.",
        "I like how it has developed over the months; it's much more user friendly than at the beginning when it was difficult to even sign up. The extra articles, video/blogs, graphs & maps are interesting & useful. It's a bit sad it's a smartphone only app as my basic phone user brother can't participate (he doesn't want me to report in for him). Annoyingly, although this is designed for a phone, when I'm typing in extra symptoms the page keeps jumping & my keyboard keeps covering what I'm typing."
