        "Great App, functions well. Alot of people moaning about the noise but they need to understand it was originally set up to alert responders like myself to a cardiac arrest and that this happens infrequently and needs to be loud and out there to make sure it alerts us! I have responded using it and it was very good and I know of several responders that use it well.",
        "Like others have said, I have an issue with the siren. I am a petsitter and it terrifies some of the cats I am visiting. I did ring and complain about this. I ended up turning it off the weeks. I have just turned it back on. Two alerts I accepted. First I keep ringing so dropped the job. Another had already arranged for someone to take him shopping. Now I have just got back the alert I dropped earlier and still no answer. The alerts are not reliable.",
        "All this good will from the public is thrown away by an app that is next to useless. When alerted people have no idea why I'm phoning, their data doesn't match up with the message and the message is often hours/days old although the alarm has just sounded. What a waste of people's willingness to help in this crisis.",
        "I don't seem to be the only one having trouble with the app. Firstly, the alarm is ear splitting, is there any way to turn it down please? I've just called a lady (I only do chats, as I'm stuck in too) she had no idea what it was all about, & didn't know why I was calling. I've had this before, but I chatted with her anyway, and she was ok. Also, I've been logging in 9-5 every day bar Sun, since lockdown started, but my hours are stuck on 388 and never change. This doesn't show all I've done.",
        "Worked fine for quite some time and yet now, no requests are coming through and nobody knows why. Have reinstalled etc but no joy. Constantly failing, and no reasoning for it, have emailed you but no response, so I can't help people who need support.",
        "Not enough room to write in here what needs addressing as it's limited to 500 letters and spaces I'd barely touched the surface on what needs sorting and ran out of space, but there isn't enough information or user functionality in the app we need a lot more communication options in app with a more detailed description to assist with dealing with failed calls not being answered by the people that are in need plus a lot of other options and also an in app guidance and helpcentre",
        "Good app but siren way too loud, it's driving my neighbour mad ! Apart from that, as others say here, 90% of people I ring have no idea why I rang, or how or why somebody put them on list. That needs addressing . On top of that some of the alerts are days old ,their prescription or shopping done days ago.Im becoming a bit disheartened wasting my time every day. I'm more than happy to run around for folks but less happy with wasted calls",
        "I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location. I'm in London so I am sure there are people nearby that I could help but as is I am not seeing them. Please fix this!",
        "App is ok but no way to check back on previous messages. I responded to a call from a gentleman who needed shopping tomorrow. I agreed to do it and then toggled the app to show \"responded\" as soon as I've done that then previous messages dissappear and I now no longer have address or contact details to sort this out tomorrow!!",
        "App is OK apart from: (1) the ear splitting siren which I've now turned off by going into the Responder settings via my phones Apps option. The downside is I mow miss most requests! Need an alternative noise. (2) I didn't sign up for chats (I'm rubbish at them) so either don't send them (most requests are chats) or enable me to see what the request is so I can decline if its chat. At the moment the alert does not indicate what its about. Until changes made the app remains set to Off Duty.",
        "The app is ok however this Sunday I received 6 requests in quick succession. All bar one needed no help, and most requests I get end up being no help needed. My main criticism of the app is that once an alert comes in it sets my notification volume to max. I don't want or need to be notified each time normal messages come in which is why it is set to mute. Please can you make sure the app doesn't change my notification settings",
        "Only just come back to the app...but now i know why I deleted it! The siren is just too loud! I have to have my phone on silent now to stop it going off. I can understand why it was there during the apps initial use, for first responders calling to medical emergencies, but check in and chats or collecting groceries and prescriptions are hardly medical emergencies that need to be completed that precise minute. I cannot have my phone on silent constantly, so think I will have to delete it again...",
        "App is obviously for a good cause, but I keep signing myself out as off duty to avoid the ear splitting notifications (which are unaffected by muting your phone) 3x a minute for requests that are way out of my range. Needs location restrictions and notification adjustments ASAP!",
        "Very poor for something so important. Clumsy, bad layout, adding an AED is broken. Come on, this app is IMPORTANT. Sort it out. (Reply to developer - Yes I have checked both of those settings and it still doesn't work. No reply to 4 emails requesting help either)",
        "The alerts work for a few weeks then the siren stop and I'm not notified of an alert. It just says in comma you missed an alert. So frustrating.",
        "Completely unusable. When you get an alert, there's absolutely no indication as to what you're supposed to do, and no way to contact the person needing help.",
        "I've responded a couple of times to find that the chat request was for the previous day and had been dealt with? Embarrassing and unnecessary and the siren is excruciating why not a special phone sound kinder on the ears",
        "I am receiving alerts from miles away.. sometimes even different cities, which are more than 200 miles away. \ud83d\ude12",
        "When volunteering in SE London I get a lot of requests which are 4-8miles away. This is too far in a city and unnecessary given the number of volunteers that must be available (e.g 15 within a few hundred yards of me). I therefore waste a lot of time with the siren continually blarring and rejecting 9 out of ten requests before accepting a request within a reasonable distance. It should be easy add a setting so that requests beyond a certain distance are not referred.",
        "Still unable to upload photos of new AEDs locations to the GoodSAM app. I've replied via email and awaiting your reply.",
        "Opens to register but thats as far as it goes, fill in my details and hit register and nothing happens, the little wheel just goes round and round",
        "I can't believe you can't adjust the volume on that siren, deleting it.",
        "App has gone crazy, doesn't know my location. Giving me alerts up to 10 miles away. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
        "Appreciate your helpful response - sadly my area is not on the list but I noticed the link for registering my interest in case it is added in the future. Thank you and all the best",
        "I'm always contacted for assistance for another town 15 miles away - nowhere else and never anywhere nearby around my own town of 30k people... As I'm not registered for check in, chat, I'm not sure why I'm continually contacted. The siren is a ridiculously loud alarm too. As this app now serves more than a single purpose, some thoughts on a sensible method of notification should be considered.",
        "Goodsam can u explain as to WHY today their was a serious cardiac arrest which happened litrally 2mins from where i live....why wasnt the alarm raised and i could of potentially saved this old gents life,but because nobody knew were the nearest defibrillator was,by time ambulance etc got to him he had passed away...This absolutely breaks my heart because i could of saved this gent potential, but was not alerted.....its a disgrace really is....",
        "My app ppears that it doesn't work I havent had any alerts, and I can't change my organisation",
        "I'm a proper volunteer and the app made so many false alarms....I've heard many people treating me like a sales representative, pissed off at me and treating me rudely... That's why I quit being a volunteer",
        "I'm afraid I won't be using the app. The siren is, as the previous reviewer stated, ear splitting. I'll volunteer through a local organisation.",
        "Not contacted very often. Sometimes people dont need any help.",
        "Well after not bothering to log on much over the summer due to never being called on, I received an email saying more people were needing help. Plus I felt I should do something to say thank you for early access to the Track and Trace app. I logged on half an hour ago and just had my first call! She's already received help from a neighbour but was very grateful for the call.",
        "Doesn't work. I try to register using my St John certificate and the swirl of doom just spins foreverrrrrrrr; by which I mean 20 minutes over WiFi. Was able to register via the Web then log in to the app. But app registration just did not work.",
        "I have had 5 requests. 1 was a day after the person asked for help. The others were well over 100km away from me (Merseyside, Tyneside, Yorkshire, East Midlands). The call centre just asks me to check my location or reinstall the app. No way to report the problems or raise a concern if a person does not respond - I was just told to pass it to another volunteer. Also the app tells me nothing about what an alert is for apart from location and time, so I don't know what a task is until I accept.",
        "It would be good to be able to lower the siren alarm, as I imagine it's quite annoying for my neighbours and is loud enough to make me jump. I get lots of alerts, but many too far away to accept (some on the other side of the country!) I've yet to receive a genuine request for help, only endless false alarms. I'm not sure how these are being triggered, but it causes a lot of confusion when I am able to get through to the number provided.",
        "Very poor app, signed up when first launched, my trust doesn't use this app, but when I've been out of area to trusts that do, response either next time I open the app, ( set to locate all time and always on data/ wifi) since update unable to load AED's (even with GPS data etc enabled) unable to use report tab (blank screen) and since update myself is duplicated 2 times that I can see. Bugs need fixing asa0",
        "I have received many alerts but was able to respind to only one as the alarm no longer works on my phone, although it does if I simulate it.",
        "Had a request for help, but on looking at request it was 187692 meters away, 116 miles!. No details if request was for chat. When contacted help line stated it should have given that request!. Cannot find on APP if i stated i would be available foe check in and chat!? But if APP could show that chat only was needed could yhis not hell?",
        "A lot of the responses are old and people don't need help anymore. In some cases they tell me they have had lots of calls!! It makes a terrifying sound when it goes off like an Air Raid siren!! Sounds like an emergency alert. Really needs work and that horrendous noise needs turning off. I've just uninstalled.",
        "Haven't received an alert in almost a year. All toggle buttons reset to default which doesn't let me get any alerts even when on duty and responding to a paged incident. Contacted developers and was assured it wouldn't affect being alerted....but clearly it has. 18/07/2020: still not receiving any alerts even when on shift.",
        "Really poor. They are trying to use the app for something it is not intended for and only a fraction of the process is actually covered In the app so it's kind of redundant for the most part. Standard NHS/PHE/government approach really"
