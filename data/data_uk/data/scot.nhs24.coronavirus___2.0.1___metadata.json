        "Rubish it does not work andstops everything elsewith failed to launch",
        "This is an excellent app with key information relating to coronavirus. Everyone should download it. However, for all of the clueless wonders out there who cannot read and have left it One Star reviews because it doesn't trace, it's not supposed to trace. There is a specific, dedicated app for 'Test & Protect' in Scotland, and that is the new Scottish tracking app. Learn to read, and you may well have a better chance of doing what you need to do in order to avoid coronavirus.",
        "Very disappointed with this app, very very basic, no proximity alerts, no information where positive areas are. I really wanted this app to impress me but sadly has failed. Why not just team up with the Kings College / ZOE Covid19 app as this has more information on where the hotpots are and offers you daily check-in for symptoms to collect live data. Come on NHS Scotland you can do much better than this!",
        "Since there's so many NHS apps, one general for patients who may need advice for their condition, another for general health information, whilst so many 3rd parties are using their logo, can NHS not name this Scottish app with Scotland AND COVID-19 in the name so the English and Welsh people can avoid this one?",
        "If you are looking for the contact tracing app you need to search for Protect Scotland - this is not the app you are looking for. Stay Safe, Be Kind.",
        "Straight forward to use and no nonsense answers to questions",
        "This is too basic, and tells you nothing about covid-19 nor its wider symptoms. It just asks those 3 questions. I wonder if this is just a waste of resources.",
        "I couldn't see anything about contact tracing if I came close to someone who tested positive. Just a lidt of symptoms",
        "Scottish Government adding confusion to the imminent release of the official UK Government NHS COVID-19 tracking app by releasing a similarly named app containing information about the virus and NHS Scotland services. The content is nothing more than a webportal of information. Why not collaborate (and save money) by putting the information into the official app based on the postcode entered?",
        "Unable to download as my phone is too old.",
        "Just hope that this app works well for all of us if not we'll all in big trouble.",
        "Where is proximity warning!!!",
        "Can this app notify me for other people who have covid",
        "Nothing new here",
        "This is for Scotland not England",
        "Wouldn't work",
        "How do i check using post code",
        "Doesn't work.",
        "Not sure I've got the right app I wanted the track and trace one",
        "I am in England not Scotland",
        "Big Brother is watching you!",
