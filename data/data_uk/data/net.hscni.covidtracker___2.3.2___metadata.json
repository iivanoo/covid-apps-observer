        "App randomly stops publishing exposure checks which would imply its no longer working. Have had to reinstall 3 times.",
        "I have used it daily just to see if it works and it has never went off. I work on a Covid Ward... I also have family who were in the same place for the same amount of time with the same people and some got the notification and others didnt. It simply doesn't work.",
        "It took a while to download and install. However when you first open the app it says \"tracing not active \" this suggests the app is not running in the background. Update: Working great now.",
        "Its not working...I have uninstalled it twice and reinstalled and its not even doing checks. I havent received anything from this app. This needs fixed if its designed to help prevent spread of Covid-19 and save lives. Very disappointed",
        "This app is completely pointless. Mine has to be reinstalled every couple of days after which it will carry out exposure checks for a day or 2 and then completely stop. I could have been in contact with numerous people and had to self isolate but I dont know because the app isn't doing the checks.",
        "Even though it says you only need Bluetooth enabled my app tells me to keep location enabled for notifications. This drains my battery so I won't be using it.",
        "Got a notification to say i was in contact and had to isolate. Only problem was i had been in contact the 10th. First told of it the 23rd with 1day left to isolate. Its reliant on people updating the app with their test results and if they dont do that then nobody knows",
        "Can't tell if it's working or not. Was in A&E people positive test for Covid 19.",
        "Notification doesn't work",
        "The app told me to self isolate for a period of 10 days which ended 2 days before I got the notification.",
        "I got an alert tonight showing close contact on the 26th November.. Problem being the alert only came through when the isolation period ended that being 10th December? Very worrying!",
        "Tested positive but cant update in app so close contacts can be informed because you don't actually get a code to enter. Completely pointless!",
        "Never seems to work! Keeps telling me to turn on my bluetooth...bluetooth is on!! I give up pointless",
        "Clear and easy to use",
        "It didn't send me any notification I happened to open my app and had 4 days self isolation left, that was certainly pointless considering I missed 6 days isolation and being around my co workers",
        "Absolute waste of time. Even after spending 12 days in hospital and being exposed to co-vid, I received nothing from this app",
        "Why does it not check for exposure ive had 0 exposure checks for the past 25 days or so why???",
        "Never seems to check, always a week or so behind.",
        "App won't open/crashes even after re-downloading",
        "I NEVER downloaded this app, yet, I have recently discovered it on my fone AND WITH ALL PERMISSIONS ALLOWED etc??? An explanation would be appreciated!!! Immediately deleted after discovery.",
        "Great to see and well designed. Fantastic to have an app like this so quickly for NI",
        "Makes the phone sooo slooooow that it's unusable. Had to uninstall.",
        "I used this app from I tested positive it has never turned red etc like it suppose to \ud83d\ude21",
        "I have just deleted the app, the police in England are being given new powers to access your information via the app. Its only a matter of time before NI does the same. This is NOT what I signed up for. Completely lost my trust and have uninstalled. The notifications aren't useful, it doesn't tell you when or where you came into contact with someone.",
        "Notified that I'd been exposed nine days previous and that I needed to isolate for one more day. Bit late notice considering I'm a key worker and have been working in the hospital during the previous nine days.",
        "The app worked well but I noticed at times when I was out that no checks had been made. I did recieve an alert to isolate for 14 days which I did, yet on the 5th day into isolation I got another notification saying that I've been exposed and have to isolate for 14 days. I hadn't left to house, I didnt even leave my bedroom so I'm not sure how accurate this app is which is why I removed it.",
        "It does what it says and this update will make things much clearer for anyone receiving notifications",
        "It has stopped working for over a week",
        "Doubtful it works, it only does a check when you go in and prompt it, I had zero checks for 14 days on a few occasions. I have the app on 3 devices in the same house and they have never had a handshake with each other.",
        "I don't see the point in this app. As I checked today 2nd November as I'd accidentally knocked off Bluetooth. Seen it last checked on 12th October. I am a key worker, I could potentially come into contact with this virus. And after 14 days it removes data. So that is a lot of potential contact with this virus missed. If it's not going to work and check then why have it installed?",
        "Honestly I fear this App doesn't work on certain Phones. I've went day without a check, but my wife who has the same App on a different phone and is constantly by my side has had several checks. I'm beginning to wonder if it's the Phone you have the App download on which receives more that other checks",
        "I had hoped that this app would provide useful timely and accurate information to users. Instead I see that the statistics are not kept up to date. By way of example today is 05/11/20 but the R number estimate is from 16/10/20. Come on people for the sake of credibility must do better!",
        "Just discovered the app had been \"Auto Disabled\" on my android phone. Something to watch out for (When it's running you should get a notification once a week, reminding you and confirming that it is indeed running).",
        "This app is a scam , it steals all your information and sent to 3rd parties , so be careful.",
        "My phone (Galaxy A10) keeps turning off when I tap the exposure check option... so I can't see them and my phone then has to restart.. very concerning as it would seem that the app is faulty or bugged??",
        "Seldom does any checks, I've uninstalled resintallled and checked all settings and always have the Bluetooth on, yet the checks are still sparse and intermittent. No confidence that this works.",
        "So far so good, the app seems to be working well in the background and notifies me on a weekly basis for the searches it has done. However like other users to search for the app on play store, it will not show up at all. I had to go through the HSE NI site to get link to the app to download it. I hope However that everyone will use this and maybe reduce the R Rate again.",
        "Great app and will hopefully make a difference. However, only 4 stars because the app was very hard to find in the Play Store. I had to go to the existing HSE NI Covid info app, click on the app developer name at the top and see this as the only other app created by the HSE NI. If you just search for 'stopcovid NI' the app does not appear in the search results at all. I am not sure if this is something within the developers control but the more people who can easily find and download the better.",
        "I am yet to find out if the app is working. Bluetooth is turned on yet, everytime I open the app it states that: \"Tracing is not active, so the app won't work.\" This status changes after 5 seconds to: \"You can close this app and it will keep working.\" I am using android and really would like some feedback. Is olit working or not?",
        "I cannot have any confidence this app works. It tells you it runs even if you close it. However, when I run it, close it and re-open it I am greeted with the message \"Tracing is not active, so this app won't work\" even though I've left Bluetooth on. Then a moment later it tells me it's working again. How can I be confident it is in fact working when the app is closed?"
