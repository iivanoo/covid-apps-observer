        "Trying to prove my identity with this app was a nightmare. Whenever I got to the point to upload an image, for sending photo id, to take a photo or upload a video, nothing happened when i tapped the camera icon! Seems certain random aspects of things on PHE/NHS apps don't seem to work on a Huawei P20! In the end i had to complete the registration process using an old SAMSUNG phone! BEyond that, everything seems fine.",
        "I find the app useful, however have just updated to your latest version. And now when I log out it loops back to the finger print recognition page (fprp) instead of closing the app. And when you cancel the fprp it just sits there and doesn't close.",
        "Doesn't open camera /video despite being given permission. Dev: read the review. The app doesn't open phone camera. No problem registering.",
        "I tried 4 times to register. Each time the facial recognition did not work. It's too difficult. Wasted my time.",
        "No problems setting up and getting identity sorted. Crashed a few times upon logging in with the most recent update, but worked after a few tries.",
        "Absolute pants!! Can't open camcorder to record the video required to complete registration. Very frustrating!!!",
        "I like the app, but as yet I can't book appointments at my GP, or get results online, which I'd like to see developed in the future.",
        "Won't work on my Galaxy S4 (10/10/20). Just followed prompt to update app (11/12/20) AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK....!!",
        "Unable to log in. The code is sent to me after 5 minutes and therefore expired!!! Have tried 10 times. Useless",
        "It has been easy to follow the instructions and my order was delivered without any delay. Very happy with the services",
        "So far I wouldnt recommend this app as I can not get it. On the log in page it asks for your mobile phone number then says it will send a registration number to your mobile. Ok, it did this - but I tried five times and every time I went back with the correct number you app would not accept it - and told me to try again!!!! How can you keep the app open to complete the registration and look at the text it sends you at the same time? I had to close the app, look at the text, go back to the app and start again.....all really annoying!!! surely there must be a better way of doing it???",
        "Basic software! temperamental - it crashes often, which is rather annoying. Reflects how bad the healthcare system is, unfortunately. We expect much, much more & we should be getting it!! The app is nothing special, no features to help patients be informed & take action regarding our own health. My advice is to avoid the app. Use ya Internet browser to access your records via systmonline (sign up required). \"C'mon developers where's ya spunk? Whats soo hard? (not me...) Get with the program!\"",
        "Can not login to the gp service need to get in touch with my doctors can not do that because you get put in a queue which takes for ever and I don't have the time being a hgv driver then they don't want to give out this information with out giving you the third degree another useless app by NHS just have to suffer in silence \ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude2a and they still want one star for being pants",
        "Couldn't find anyway to select a notification sound of my choice. Needs the ability to select a different notification sound other than the default. With so many notifications from social media, texts, emails etc, it needs a differentiating notification. Many of my other apps make use of the built in ring tones and sounds. There is no reason why this app shouldn't do the same.",
        "Excellent. Easy to use & everything in one place: records, appointments, prescriptions including current, previous & acute, access to advice & more. Also 5* support by app, email & phone. We received excellent advice, support & kindness just today from Tom L. (Development Maintenance & Service & Support Teams) from NHS App after failing to receive help or understanding anywhere else. Thank you.",
        "I installed the app with no problems, the confirmation email took a while to come, but after that all went smoothly. It accepted a photo of my passport and face profile, plus it readily accepts fingerprint login. The only issue which is not the apps fault, is it's of limited use, because my surgery doesn't allow access to my medical records, nor accept repeat prescriptions or appointments, hopefully over time things will become more joined up, when it will hopefully prove it's worth. \ud83d\ude09",
        "Great app, easy to use, can order repeat prescription, select which pharmacy to pick up from, but would like to be able to register my children's details under my account so I don't have to keep bothering the doctors with calls for prescription, of course that would require proof I'm their mother, it would make life so much easier though.",
        "Much like the rest of the NHS this app isn't there for me when I actually need something from it. When I upload a picture of my license to confirm my identity, it gets to 100% and then says there's a technical problem and to tey again where it will fail every attempt.",
        "I can only partly review the app because my surgery are not currently registering people for their online service so I can't really use the app. Very frustrating as the other options are driving to my doctors and posting a request or sending in a request by post. Which with covid being a thing seems absolutely bonkers. I may as well send a telegram or carrier pigeon.",
        "Just ran an update. When I try to \"Continue with NHS login\", I just get a blank white page that goes nowhere. Updated review. Completely uninstalled app and reinstalled. This worked. Can login again. Upgraded the rating a couple of stars but can't give it more as it didn't work straight after the upgrade. I had used the app to describe symptoms and got a doctor call back within 36 hours from my local surgery. Was easy to use and resulted in a prescription that I could collect within hours.",
        "Had no problems...easy registered....It would be great within the app...if your chosen pharmacy, could let you know when your items are ready to pick up. The pharmacy we go to have released their app, similar to Patient Access, with the difference being...the new app lets you know when meds are ready....would be perfect if it was all under one umbrella, without the need to download so many apps \ud83d\ude0a",
        "So far, this app had proved reliable. As long as you have the correct registration details to hand, it's straight forward to set up and I have successfully requested and received a repeat prescription. Future reliability yet to be decided.",
        "App works absolutely fine for me. Uploaded all information using android phone. Requires NHS checks / approval based on id submission which is understandable given the personal data you'll be able to view. Having 10 digit NHS number to hand probably helps with ease of registration. With the app itself I like what I see.",
        "This is the third app I have used to connect to my drs surgery. The first was patient access which worked fine for a couple of years then just wouldn't link. The second was evergreen which let me make appointments and scripts but would never log into medical history for test results. Now I'm on this nhs one. At first it was like the evergreen one but since the update I am really pleased! Its linked in to all parts of the app and I get test results the next day! This is important! Thank you!",
        "A really good app - once you've got through the initial setup and proved identity etc, just uses the fingerprint scanner on the phone to log in, and you can order your repeate prescription, look back at your medical notes etc. The functionality is there to book appointments but my GP surgery seems to have turned that off (but that's not the fault of the app).",
        "Update: never had a problem with repeat prescription, now can't order through app and need to contact GP. making this app pointless. Rubbish.. forced to move to this app to continue repeat prescriptions. I am ok with using it. Absolute rubbish for those who are not tech savvy, like folks. In a time were covid still poses a risk and factor in you can't call to order a prescription why, why introduce this??!! Has added stress to family members regarding their medication that they didn't need!!",
        "App keeps forgetting login, and does not integrate with Android password manager or security. Also doesn't load camera for ID verification, so I needed to separately take photos/videos, but the app would reset itself yet again. When Rx renewals expire and require review by GP, the Rx just disappears from app with no message. No reminder to renew Rx, which would be useful. Also, my GP hasn't been receiving Rx renewals or messages, even though appliers correct surgery. So it's useless.",
        "This app is brilliant. It's so easy to use. I order my repeat prescription from this with out needing to see or contacting my doctor. Just 2 clicks and it's done. Makes things so much easier for everyone.",
        "My initial review of this was far from flattering. Would NOT allow me to register using passport and video upload. Seems to be a common problem judging by other comments. Avoid this by using the alternative route and get your GP surgery to provide passcodes etc. Having finaly managed to register using these data, the App seems fine but it was a very stressful experience.",
        "When submitting my passport the app has a technical error repeatedly, so frustrating!",
        "Such a useful app. Wish I had it sooner. I uploaded my ID with ease and it was approved within the hour. I can now see my repeats, order my repeats, I can see all my GP appointments past and future and all my past medications. I updated my organ donor status too. Such a handy place for everything to do with my healthcare. Ignore the bad reviews",
        "Really easy and quick access to all the information you need, and has been added in your medical records which you can have a access to it. You can book an appointments, repeated prescription service, you have the choice where from which pharmacy you will collect your meds , or stay home safe and get delivered them straight to your door.",
        "I'm going to have to use a different app because of the identity check taking long (or based on other comments, not even working at all). Very frustrating, especially at the time I need the service & I need it to work. No time scale provided for how long the checks will take. Why do they have to take so long?? The gov UK app checks take literally a few seconds. What's app different about this app?",
        "Total garbage - sent through with passport photo and video twice and still not passed the ID check. For something so simple it takes ages. I get they are trying to protect sensitive data but this is insane. My ID works for the bank, for entering and leaving the country, and for other security checks, but NHS can't figure out who I am. Lord help us if they use this to identify having your tonsils out, they'd probably misidentify it and chop off your head.",
        "Doesn't work when you try to book a GP appointment. Doesn't let you view your full medical record unless you contact your surgery. If it worked correctly it would be brilliant. It's almost as bad as a real life GP receptionist.",
        "Garbage. I uploaded my details, it failed because my name, date of birth or address was wrong. I'd already updated my address to the new one with my GP, but I decided to try the old one. It worked. Then I waited 24 hours for them to complain about my passport. All edges were there, photo was visible, all text was readable, but there was in fact some blur in the top right corner. So I tried again. This time it failed again claiming name, date of birth or address was wrong. I give up.",
        "I have tried several times to get full access to this app but every time I get to the point where I have to prove my identity either the app stops or it fails to recognise me from my photo ID, despite the fact that my apperence has not changed that much.",
        "I've received an alert to say I have to self isolate as I have been in close contact with someone, but I haven't, last week I went to the doctors (who I called and are okay), a fish & chip shop to collect food, I wear gloves and touch nothing, & I popped into the co-op, in all cases I was not close to anyone, why have I been sent the message ?? Edit.... thank you for your note, sorry, I will contact the website you have suggested \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Dreadful. Everytime I try to connect face to ID it, the app, either restarts or fails to sync my face with ID. I have had to login again so many times now. Every second time I've taken a pic of my driving license, the app just restarts. My initial face scans didn't work. I recorded a video as suggested but haven't succeeded in getting past the photo ID section to send it. I've noticed the complete lack of personal replies here. If I get a \"copy and paste\" reply it will show real lack of care.",
        "The app is fine when it works but on more than three occasions have had to chace up my electronic prescription as not recieved by pharmacy. Leaving me very low or without medication and stressed having to contact my GP for paper script at a time they are asking people not to attend if necessary."
