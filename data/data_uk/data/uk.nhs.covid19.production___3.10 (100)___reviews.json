Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people would have slipped through the net here. And yet the government still blame the public for the spread of COVID-19.",

If someone arrives at a venue after I have left I don't need to be contacted, do I? The developer's response to her did not answer the question. Also, Bluetooth is unreliable for measuring distance, as I understand. Furthermore, the Irish version - same as the UK's, I believe - isn't working very reliably. Edit 2 Nov 20: Having just seen the DHSS response (I don't think I receoved an email alert), I have now sent the review to the reporting website given. I have also reported not yet getting the update, which was supposed to have been released on 27 Oct 20. How long is the roll-out expected to take?",

This is a useless and horrible app. I don't have symptoms. I do not have a sore throat, loss of taste or smell, a cough and I never reported any of those. I am angry. I now have to tell my friends they do not need to isolate because of you. Utterly useless app. World beating. A 14 year old could do better than this. Absolutely useless.",

I need to have a menu item where I can check exactly when and where the exposure occurred, or even better, my entire check history should be available to me. This is important because since only 84000 people have downloaded the app, I need to be able to interpret negative and positive results accordingly. The \"Read latest advice\" needs to actually point somewhere useful, for example, we are about to enter a second lockdown, and yet the target page only shows general information, nothing lockdown related. Venue-check-in is convenient. UI is adequate and clean. The app is better than it used to be, but still not great.",

Got a useful message this morning that my area has been moved to tier 3. This was good as i don't really follow the local news, it also gave a link to find out what the new restrictions were. I also noted the stop contact tracing button for when you have mitigation in place. Great app so far, if you are like me who wears a mask in shops etc. you should at least give it a try out....",
