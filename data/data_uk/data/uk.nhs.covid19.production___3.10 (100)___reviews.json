The app insists it doesn't track people but won't work without location services so clearly it does track your location. I do not use location on my phone as I don't want Google to know my every move, the same goes for this app. I had hoped for better but sadly I won't be using this app for the 2 above reasons. If you want people to use it more then be honest and say its a battery draining app and it also tracks your location.",
