        "Don't get me wrong here, I use this app to volunteer to assist in vaccination shifts. However lately, you have vaccination centres and pharmacists located in the same area when your volunteering to do these shifts. Wouldn't it have been a better idea to have one area for centres and a separate one for pharmacists. Having all of them in the same area, not only makes this app confusing. It also makes it hard to find out the venues where you volunteer at.",
        "Uses mobile data like it's going out of fashion. 2 6 hour shift's and I have used 80 percent of my monthly allocation. Update - thanks for the feedback. It used 460mb in 2 weeks and I was off wi-fi for 15 hours in that time. I've had to turn mobile data off until my next month starts as I've used up my allocation, so will let you know if it's improved in July.",
        "App not working properly for me any more. Says the GoodSAM Responder is running. I'm unable to accept any tasks. Another message: We are trying to obtain your location. Please make sure your location services are enabled and our App has access to them. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the App, but made no difference.",
        "Great app! Got a couple alerts recently and the ambulance service is always happy to see help!",
        "The notification alerts are limited to: 1.embarrasingly loud & protracted. 2. irritating as hell 3. difficult to hear The app itself works reasonably well but, having tried everything I can think of, I simply can't get it to remember my password I.e. no apparent option including via phone settings. All other apps give option to retain on installation. Tiresome logging in, therefore, which at times can be for remorseless alerts for assistance throughout the day. So, very poorly designed.",
        "Tried to register right now. Filled in my details and upon pressing the register button got the notification: \"Couldn't send the registration link to the email provided. Is the email correct?\" Yes, it is correct, because I used the \"Passwort forgotten\" button that send me a resetting link to the same email. Now I can't go through registration, since the registration link never reached my inbox but apparently the email did, because \"this email is in use\". \ud83d\ude44 Will give more stars later.",
        "Not sure who can help me but I am getting alarms about community task but there is some issue with app. It is just showing running logo but so not let me accept or reject task.",
        "Not happy. This month the app used nearly all my data so had to remove it from my phone. Have just reinstalled it for next month.",
        "Well designed and simple. Great work. For future tasks I would love to save a filter on date, or day of week. I would be more likely to find a steward shift I can attend.",
        "Very buggy with locations and 2nd alerts for the same event.",
        "It's hanging. Neither accept nor reject is possible. Update. I installed on a different phone and exactly the same problem exists on that. Therefore it's my account that is locked, not the app. How can I get my account working again? Uninstalled and restarted but the uninstall process is incomplete as when I reinstall and open it goes immediately to the same hanging task screen. I've Uninstalled it as its unuseable for me now.",
        "Don't like the icon always on display when on duty. It just adds unnecessary clutter to phone screen and more importantly means I'm less likely to spot an alert which is what the icon always meant. Please change this back or at least give users the option to switch off.",
        "I've registered to volunteer at vaccination sites, received an email saying that they have noticed I hadn't taken up any opportunity, well that's because I haven't received any! Still receiving check in and chat and community response but nothing else.",
        "Doesn't pick up shifts within 25. Only when I'm in a big city and not from home base! Even though I live closer to the shifts being offered! Live in Skelton (North East Yorkshire). Don't get anything at all even for shifts at Redcar - though can see shifs at Redcar when I'm in Middlesbrough!",
        "The app is not loading the page my details is fully. Only showing my name, verifying organisation and expiry date. I cannot get the rest the page to load. I need access to this to be able adjust the notification alter by turning off the siren when I am going into a meeting at work. Please help..",
        "I'm updating my review as all seems to have settled down now, although it took a while. I'm getting more and more tasks now, so it shows how much people need the support. I'm more than happy to be a volunteer, and I get as much out of it as the people I'm ringing and checking up on!",
        "App was working really well for me until about a week ago. Suddenly started eating data and won't display the part of my profile that allows me to go on and off duty. I have tried updating and reinstalling but still isn't working properly.",
        "Can we have a filter option by day of the week or time under future tasks, please? Sometimes with more than several hundreds on that list it is very difficult to find the relevant ones for VSS roles. Many thanks.",
        "Works for me. However, it would be nice to be able to list future tasks differently or offer sort by options.",
        "Uses phenomenal amount of battery power...and not insignificant in it's data use.",
        "Great idea the only problem k have at the moment is there's no buttons when I'm running a simulation",
        "Attempted to register as a registered responder and 4 weeks later still waiting for it to be reviewed/approved. Nil other way to contact them.",
        "Since updating the app today to show on duty icon is on not been able to accept calls / help even though being alerted",
        "I don't receive any volunteer marshall opportunities which is frustrating to do Your response would make sense if I wasn't in the same household who has their phone pinging with opportunities all day ..",
        "Been stuck on the loading screen for 4 days now...",
        "Finally getting tasks. Whatever you did to fix the problem, thanks.",
        "Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a \"double ding\" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the \"accept\" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the \"bypass silent\" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one \"ding\" now as expected - thnx!",
        "Edit: Thank you for clarifying and the quick response, that is working now! The app is not sending me notifications, I have been sent tasks but are missing them (even though I have been using my phone at the time the message is sent) because the app isn't sending my phone notifications. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times now and have checked notification and location permissions are allowed...",
        "I didn't find it very easy to install the app. It wouldn't work on my Android Tablet, so I did it on my phone but then it asked me to \"simulate an alert\" on my laptop as there would be no sound on my phone while the app was switched on. Then I disovered that I couldn't login on my laptop with my email and password because it seems I already have an account which I must have created when I registered as a volunteer early last year and which I had forgotten about, as I was never asked to volunteer. I am confused now about what to do and have spent nearly an hour trying to sort this out. I just want to help.",
        "The installation is clunky. If there's anything going to stop somewhere using an app, that'll be it. (I test and write software as a profession.) It's hard to scroll the page without hitting a selector (such as the country). The image crop allows only a square and could not set to the width of my driver's license, so part of the license was cut off. After several attemps of that, I was forced to select Work ID instead of Drivers License. And please fully capitalise countries' names! Edit: Thank you for your reply. I know how to use a camera. The image I was trying to use had the full driver's license - it was the cropping that did not allow me to use any more than 2/3 of the image that was previously taken by the camera. Edit 2: As noted, it can get into a state where a community responder cannot select 'drivetrs license. Was this app tested by devs?",
        "Upon installation, I can't seem to get past the initial introduction pages. The button at the bottom which says \"Ask for permissions\" does nothing when tapped. I've checked the permissions that the app has been granted in the application manager, and it has everything it needs. Phone is a Samsung J3 running Android 5.1.1. Update: Thanks to the team for updating this so quickly. All working perfectly now!",
        "The distance slider doesnt work properly. If I slide it to 25km, I go to another section of the app then come back to the distance and it has reset to a random distance. If I change it again, do something else and come back, the distance has reset to another random number. Quite infuriating and means it is not possible to set yourself as available in the correct radius. Samsung S8.",
        "Update: issue now fixed with a distance slider on the 'me' tab, the app now works fine. ----- I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.",
        "Brilliant have been able to help lots of people using this. Would like to know how to turn the volume for the siren down as very loud but other than that I have used it for over a year now with no problems.",
        "This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...",
        "Over 500 hours of volunteering, not been called on once. Reported the problem, told to uninstall and reinstall. Did that a few times, still not working. Reported the problem verbally on a couple of occasions as well as by email, to no avail. How much money and time have the NHS wasted on this app? Please tell me if this app is working.",
        "1. I uninstalled the Goodsam app from my Android v10 tablet as the Task tab didn't show like on the smartphone. I was planning to reinstall to fix this bug. Now it says my tablet isn't compatible. WHY!!? It seems perverse to withdraw the tablet version. It was useful if my wife borrowed the phone. 2. I am signed up as a stewarding volunteer. It would help if you could add an alert when a task comes in. This could be the siren already in place. But as the \"tasks\" are less urgent an email would suffice.",
        "Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.",
        "Sometimes I wonder if anyone knows that I have logged on \"duty\" to the controllers. I have logged on for a mere 180 hours and in that time I have had just four \"shouts\" three of which didn't pick up and the fourth just needed a \"chat. How do I know, that you know, that I am here ready to go? Many thanks Alan Hobbs",
        "I have registered as a volunteer and downloaded the app and it closes as soon as I open it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled over 10 times and my phone is running Android 10 so should be compatible. Sorry I have just checked I am running Android 9, the app crashes within seconds of opening, I get a message on screen saying that the app has stopped running."
