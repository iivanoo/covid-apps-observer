Life is easier if you are already registered on a GP system e.g. Patient Access, where you can find (without calling your GP practice) the details required by the NHS app, as an alternative to the blood-boiling route. If not already registered, you have my sympathy. Unfortunately, after successfully registering on the NHS app by the easier route, and using it successfully initially, it now repeatedly refuses to allow me to log on, telling me I;ve been inactive for 60 mins, so has logged me off. Brilliant! P.S. The above relates to desktop app, not Android. Apologies for the mistake. However Android app also will not let me log in. It says it now doesn't recognise the original regn details (from previously used Patient Access system), despite having previously accepted them and successfully opened accounts (for self + wife) on the NHS app. As invited, I will log a fault ticket.",

But in the small print on the NHS app site it said only available for people living in England. So a mixed message is going out. So how do I get my Wales version?

But we have a circular problem here: if you do not wear your spectacles then you may not be able to read the on-screen instructions, e.g. \"move a little closer\". It is necessary to call for some help (not easy during these COVID-19 times), takeoff your spectacles and get someone to read the on-screen instructions to. Clearly, people with good eyesight designed the system. END OF PS I have used my mobile phone and a computer with various cameras to seek verification. Five times my submissions have been declined.

        "content": "Very Impressed. Had read of the problems other people had and was dreading installing this app. Got to say everything worked well. Used my passport as ID, took photo, no Problem then scanned face, didn't work first time but re-scanned making sure to be square on to phone and with a plain background, then worked well. Put in my personal details, including NHS number and all went through. Had a confirmation email within half an hour. Can now log on, linked ok to my GP surgery now all works well.",
