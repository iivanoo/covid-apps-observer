I have a number 1 by the icon for the app which suggests I have some message or notification but I can't see anything when I go onto the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and have the same notifications still there. I don't know if this means a notification has been sent , if an update hasn't loaded fully or something different. Any advice gratefully received.",
