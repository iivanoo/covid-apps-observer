I install it without any (apparent) problem, but when I start it, it just shows a full screen with the text \"NHS\" (blue and white) in a large, italic font. It shows a \"whirling\" busy icon in the middle screen, but it never seems to do anything more. Do I need to wait longer, or is there a more fundamental problem here. Thanks.",

I'll give it the benefit of doubt - maybe something isn't configured correctly at my GP's surgery... The second reason was (out of curiosity) to be able to view my health records. This seemed to be nothing more than a list of prescriptions I've had over the previous years - being generally fit and healthy, there wasn't a great deal of info here! If you have more complex health issues, then maybe this app will be useful; personally I can't see any point in it. Finally, a note to the developers - please fix the action of the BACK button. Having it set to exit the app rather than return to the previous menu is counterintuitive and extremely frustrating!",

And it's selective in what it shows, for example it doesn't show my Covid vaccination appointments but (after the 1st one) does record the fact of the vaccination. If this is going to be the vehicle for \"vaccination passports\", it needs to be more reliable. UPDATE: Following developer response asking me to raise a support ticket, I have now done that. Note I had already done this, having raised the issue directly from within the app, but have had no response. But I'll do it again, more in hope than with any confidence that anything will change.",
