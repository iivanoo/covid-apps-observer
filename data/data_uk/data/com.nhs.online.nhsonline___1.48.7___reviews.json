Phone back button returns to you the beginning of the app, not back a page. No way of returning to the previous page of info, so you have to go \"home\" and start again each time. Try to book an appointment at my GP - \"None available\", but their own website has plenty of slots. Almost no medical records listed and can't find my COVID details, so using it for the passport is a waste of time.

Please try again\", with no further information why. (the image was clear and followed the requirements) Upon attempting to retry, when pressing tick to submit a new image for verification, the app just logs me out and I have to start again, with the same results everytime. No surprise this app does not work properly given the farce of government policy, u-turns and incompetence over the last 18 months. You ask people to download the app, ask for people to have proof of vaccine, surely it would make sense it works correctly for people to use it in the manner intended. Please advise, so I can submit the image to verify my record and account in order I can see proof of the vaccine. Thanks.",

So annoyed, thought this system might help...Like inputting detail eveyrtime you do a covid test and not allowing a family log in for a busy mother - Thought IT systems where to help us not hinder....grrr",
