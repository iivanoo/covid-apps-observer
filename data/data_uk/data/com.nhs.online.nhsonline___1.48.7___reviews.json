My biggest gripe is that the app breaks the Android back button. It doesn't take you BACK to the previous page, it tries to log you out of the app every time press use it. To get back, you need to tap a link on the page, also marked \"Back\". Otherwise I would have given the app 5 stars. It was ironic to have to submit my passport and a video of myself given that anyone who knows my name, date of birth and address can access / alter this information over the phone with my GP's surgery. I suspect that this is more of a problem with my GP's surgery than this app though. I'm also surprised that it's acceptable to restrict full access to the app to people who have paid to have a form of photo ID given the claims made about measures to combat election fraud recently.",

I think it is a good thing that the NHS shares the data it has with the patient. The only problem I had was trying to check the QR code. Is there a special app to read it or anything you can recommend, because when I tried a QR reader or Scanner against it I just got \"gobblygook\" text, so I have no idea if the QR code actually works, It would be good to check that it did, before I used it in earnest.

Had accurate record of my vaccines and able to print out my vaccination record which also has QR code - I assume that this will be able to be scanned by airport/travel staff, etc, in due course.
