A total waste of time. It is MY patient data i am asking to access. The solution is to contact a surgery that has hidden behind covid for the last 15 months. I only want proof of the two vaccines .

        "content": "I think the login process is possibly unnecessary with having to take a passport photo. Especially as husband loaded same app and did not need to do this. We couldn't work out why his login was so different to my experience. Scan and passport now verified, but can't get it to work as can't link to my GP surgery Put in extra details, but says I have a login elsewhere so won't work. No idea where elsewhere is except PatientAccess and this website existed before the App. However did work for husband who has done less security checks. Totally annoying and frustrating. You go around in circles and still you can't get it to work, Needs some development work and proper testing. Update: It now seems that there is a problem with communication between the App and PatientAccess. I've been told to delete the NHS login and PatientAccess login. Happy to do the NHS login, but not happy to delete the PatientAccess login, as I need to access that for repeat prescriptions. So at this moment I've completely given up! What a waste of my time. If I could give this App zero stars then I would.",

The main issue id say is the time in processing your ID. But this is the only real way to make it secure so it's understandable. I can't comment on the covid passport yet as my ID is still under review but the app is good to use so far",
