There are still some older NHS pages online that Google finds, when asking \"what android versions does the NHS app run on\", that imply it will run on Android 4.1 or later! Why just not state the needs in the descriptive text on Android play? In any case, the first rule of creating any software that is likely to be run on different platforms (or versions of one OS.) Is to test and find out what OS & Version you are running on, plus if any \"Needed\" features are missing, then (cough...) Let the user know, not just sit there with no message, error or warning, while eating battery! Sorry, but your sort of software would not even get a foothold in other walks of life, let alone critical infrastructure. Regards.",

Phone back button returns to you the beginning of the app, not back a page. No way of returning to the previous page of info, so you have to go \"home\" and start again each time. Try to book an appointment at my GP - \"None available\", but their own website has plenty of slots. Almost no medical records listed and can't find my COVID details, so using it for the passport is a waste of time. Really hope the NHS haven't spent much money on this, a junior programmer just out of school could do better. If I could give negative stars I would. It's rubbish.",

I gave up in the end after many tries with an Honor 10 lite running android 10. Apparently its my phones fault even though its way past android 5. I used my laptop which has a front facing camera and it completed first time. Please NHS. Sort this app so people can start getting back to normal. This is a headache we just don't need.",

Please try again\", with no further information why. (the image was clear and followed the requirements) Upon attempting to retry, when pressing tick to submit a new image for verification, the app just logs me out and I have to start again, with the same results everytime. No surprise this app does not work properly given the farce of government policy, u-turns and incompetence over the last 18 months. You ask people to download the app, ask for people to have proof of vaccine, surely it would make sense it works correctly for people to use it in the manner intended. Please advise, so I can submit the image to verify my record and account in order I can see proof of the vaccine. Thanks.",

Ideal to access confirmation of COVID-19 vaccinations for travel, in case the NHS COVID pass letter does not come through we hope it will help with travel restrictions. The letter would be best giving translation, but better have a belt and braces approach in these uncertain times. Great to be able to write to the GP and order prescriptions etc.",

        "content": "Worked fine for me first time (a few months ago) & I'm very happy but husband's won't link to GP. He's tried the fixes given by support, but it still won't link despite removing & installing the account and going through everything again. Husband has GP access via EMIS so we don't understand the issue. It suggests he has a previous login but if he does, we can't find it and have no clue how to remove it! Very frustrating as he's not sure if his EMIS vaccination pass will be accepted at events.",
