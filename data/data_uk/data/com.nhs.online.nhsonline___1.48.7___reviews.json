No idea where elsewhere is except PatientAccess and this website existed before the App. However did work for husband who has done less security checks. Totally annoying and frustrating. You go around in circles and still you can't get it to work, Needs some development work and proper testing. Update: It now seems that there is a problem with communication between the App and PatientAccess. I've been told to delete the NHS login and PatientAccess login. Happy to do the NHS login, but not happy to delete the PatientAccess login, as I need to access that for repeat prescriptions. So at this moment I've completely given up! What a waste of my time.

To get back, you need to tap a link on the page, also marked \"Back\". Otherwise I would have given the app 5 stars. It was ironic to have to submit my passport and a video of myself given that anyone who knows my name, date of birth and address can access / alter this information over the phone with my GP's surgery. I suspect that this is more of a problem with my GP's surgery than this app though. I'm also surprised that it's acceptable to restrict full access to the app to people who have paid to have a form of photo ID given the claims made about measures to combat election fraud recently.",

The app decided when to take the photo instead of the user, I think it should be the other way round as I had glasses on still reading instructions, whereas the comparisons picture for validation was my driving licence which does not have me wearing glasses. I think it is a good thing that the NHS shares the data it has with the patient. The only problem I had was trying to check the QR code. Is there a special app to read it or anything you can recommend, because when I tried a QR reader or Scanner against it I just got \"gobblygook\" text, so I have no idea if the QR code actually works, It would be good to check that it did, before I used it in earnest.
