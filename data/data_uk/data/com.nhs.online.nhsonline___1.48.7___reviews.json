Please try again\", with no further information why. (the image was clear and followed the requirements) Upon attempting to retry, when pressing tick to submit a new image for verification, the app just logs me out and I have to start again, with the same results everytime. No surprise this app does not work properly given the farce of government policy, u-turns and incompetence over the last 18 months. You ask people to download the app, ask for people to have proof of vaccine, surely it would make sense it works correctly for people to use it in the manner intended. Please advise, so I can submit the image to verify my record and account in order I can see proof of the vaccine. Thanks.",

This means the app cannot take advantage of the network effect, which states that something is more useful the more people use it. How did this app ever see the light of day? Fails the most basic common sense rules. Mystified.",

Husband has GP access via EMIS so we don't understand the issue. It suggests he has a previous login but if he does, we can't find it and have no clue how to remove it! Very frustrating as he's not sure if his EMIS vaccination pass will be accepted at events.",

Because of the sensitive nature f the information that the user has access to, it really has to make you jump through a few hoops. Having so said, now the app is on my phone, access is simple. I do however urge anyone to make certain you use lock screens or other forms of security protection. All in all I'm happy to give this app 5 stars.",
