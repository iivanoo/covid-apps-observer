When registering with your details they'll send you thousands of codes and ask you to record a video with saying these numbers - all for your convenience, as you know, and protection. The app will keep kicking you out while you recording and you'll end up angry and frustrated with rejected personal details. Much easier to fly to the moon then finish this horrible registration. Thank you so much :(",

Because of the sensitive nature f the information that the user has access to, it really has to make you jump through a few hoops. Having so said, now the app is on my phone, access is simple.

We couldn't work out why his login was so different to my experience. Scan and passport now verified, but can't get it to work as can't link to my GP surgery Put in extra details, but says I have a login elsewhere so won't work. No idea where elsewhere is except PatientAccess and this website existed before the App. However did work for husband who has done less security checks. Totally annoying and frustrating. You go around in circles and still you can't get it to work, Needs some development work and proper testing. Update: It now seems that there is a problem with communication between the App and PatientAccess. I've been told to delete the NHS login and PatientAccess login. Happy to do the NHS login, but not happy to delete the PatientAccess login, as I need to access that for repeat prescriptions. So at this moment I've completely given up! What a waste of my time. If I could give this App zero stars then I would.",

My biggest gripe is that the app breaks the Android back button. It doesn't take you BACK to the previous page, it tries to log you out of the app every time press use it. To get back, you need to tap a link on the page, also marked \"Back\". Otherwise I would have given the app 5 stars. It was ironic to have to submit my passport and a video of myself given that anyone who knows my name, date of birth and address can access / alter this information over the phone with my GP's surgery. I suspect that this is more of a problem with my GP's surgery than this app though. I'm also surprised that it's acceptable to restrict full access to the app to people who have paid to have a form of photo ID given the claims made about measures to combat election fraud recently.",
