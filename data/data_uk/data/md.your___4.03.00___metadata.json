    "comments": [
        "This is a really good app. I think it could use some more features like pain location and number scale.",
        "I'm loving it. I loved the revamped UI design. Seems like I won't be needing another health app. Keep it up!",
        "makes tracking my health much easier and has built in symptom checker too!",
        "plenty of information, good amount of advice, wasn't able to recommend healthy practices specific to my condition.",
        "There could be more choices as to things to track. More importantly, I've had notes that I've written disappear. I know if I get here and record things about my condition, I write a note and there aren't always notes.",
        "Very useful used few times a week.",
        "great app for health .and .very education",
        "Need Healthy Habits.....Great Choice....your in control....",
        "It was good but now I can't connect!",
        "So far this app is fairly good. I like that it's free and pretty simple and gives links to places which give more information on what you need. I feel like the chat bot shouldn't straight away diagnose you with a condition only after you answer a few easy questions, but overall I don't mind this app at all and it's good for keeping track of day to day life :)",
        "I rarely review apps but this app i just had to. The chatbot was phenomenal and gave me advise with what i should do. The only problem i had on this app is when only male and female was there when you start, I understand that you are trying to make this app better but it would be appreciated if you fix this sooner then later. Thank you.",
        "Not as expected when compared to description; less comprehensive overall. Seemed to function okay, didn't crash, operated smoothly, but did not meet expectations I had based on description. Cannot find a way to completely DELETE my account (I can log out, but not delete). Please delete my account. Thank you.",
        "Hello! I can't open the app after updating, it just shows blank page and then closes. I'm still on android version 5.1 if it helps. I really like this app as a health checker, hope it gets a fix soon.",
        "A library if health answers and daily health education. A great way to work on self-care. I am always finding ways to help others and often forget \"me\". This app helps me to find ways to take care of me.",
        "This App is really awesome! And is so much help and helpful to motivate you and pay more attention to yourself and how your feeling. It's like a friend thats there to help you! Thank you so much it has been so helpful!",
        "There's only one thing that would improve my experience with this app. I'd like the option to go back to the previous day to add or modify items in the daily tracker. Sometimes I forget to fill it in. I'd like the option of going back to fill in the info",
        "This is a great app that offers Daily insights, a helpful assistant, and a Symptom tracker, & a Health Journal where you can annotate anything you feel may be of relevance later. I love it!",
        "Was kind of liking the app but it reset itself 5 days into the 4 week programs so I lost all progress. Not starting again, clearly a bug needs to be fixed.",
        "It is a great app, but my only complaint is that it won't always give a diagnosis, it will just say seek medical help immediately. But other than that this is a very good app.",
        "The app is really great in keeping you healthy. The Sympton checker is also great, but I don't think it should replace the hospital for users.",
        "I tried to open the app and when it asked for my birth year I put 2006,it said the app was only for 16-100 but I dont get why,people under the age of 16 might need help too this app is limiting chances of people the age of 15 and under to get help,apart from this I think the app is quite good for those over 16 as it can help them with things they didnt know they could use help with or give them more help. In conclusion good app but improve on the age situation please as I want to try it.",
        "It's extremely difficult to opt out of sharing info for this app partners. Firstly a cookies acceptance pop up window covers your screen when trying to read about setting privacy and cookies.",
        "Pretty useless if you have certain health condition and would like to track specific symptoms. Does not allow customizing symptoms to track. Most of info provided is for folks who are illiterate in health topic",
        "I love everything about the app, chatting, direct answers, the consultation too. Great app. 5star from me",
        "I have a headache today and app sent me almost strait to the doctor as a serious issue. Not sure one of headache is that serious and reason might be any. Also I would welcome dark version (theme) of the app. Headache and white screen is not good.",
        "I like the App, lot of very good features. The symptom checker bot just don't understand my sentences completely. Like I typed kidney pain, and it list it as pain on abdominal side...?",
        "It really helps to journal how I'm feeling so I can look back when I need to. Very handy & helpful app.",
        "The last update keeps saying error \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude20 and apps no longer works. Though previously this app was very useful to me but now its just a garbage in my phone storage.",
        "very good. like it has a weekly plan lile say if you have trouble sleeping week one would be on improving on that and week 2 would be a differnt target. really really really good.",
        "App won't connect to Samsung Health. I had connected it to Google Fit but then changed my mind due to not having the Fit Watch thingy to get my heart rate. Now app seems dependent on Google Fit and Wil not me unlink it to link to Samsung Healt... Help plz",
        "Interactive, informative, accumulative and comprehensive.. Honest compilation to take care of all your health concerns and risks",
        "Very helpful. the good thing about this app is that it constantly reminds you that it is not a solution But a means for help.",
        "Unable to register with email address. Keep on receiving error message, even after uninstall and reinstall.",
        "I am not even able to open the app. It always says error occoured, and says my email id is already in use...I have never used this app before, then how it is possible that my mail id is in use ?? Very bad first impression \u2639\ufe0f \u2639\ufe0f",
        "i find the information very helpful and plentiful , easy to navigate, great for looking in to symptoms and illness",
        "I've tried other health apps to learn on health issues and it did'nt satisfy my want for knoledge regarding health problems until I use this app. It's a very indespenseble tool and works superb, my outmost thanks to the developer of this, God Bless You guys!",
        "I has always been a great app. But after update it keeps crashing ..Please Fix this.",
        "I found it easy to follow and think that anything that anyone can do for scientific value is a must.",
        "The app keeps saying error when signing in or creating a new account. Wasted of time downloading the app",
        "Very easy to use. Simple layout and bold lettering."
