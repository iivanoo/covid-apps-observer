        "Nothing works! Booked a click and drop assuming that I could then scan the QR code at the post office and save some time (isn't that the whole idea!). Wrong! Post office can't read the QR code which makes the whole thing useless. Had to pay for delivery a second time. Now trying to get a refund which doesn't work either!",
        "This app is so intolerable. I get notifications about packages being delivered and when I press the notification to check, I number 1, have to go to the tracking myself to see the info even though the notification was supposed to take me there. And number 2, the tracking doesn't say it's delivered. Is it delivered or not.",
        "Rubbish. As others have mentioned: - You have to download the app to re-arrange delivery. Why can't this be done on the web-site without downloading an app? - You then have to go through lots of registration questions - When you want to re-arrange delivery you have to re-enter your name & address that you entered on registration. Why is there no option to use your registered name & address? - If you enter the ref number with spaces as printed on the card left it fails so you have to take the spaces out. What sort of amatuer software is that?! - Then after all that it throws a validation error. Total waste of time.",
        "Absolute garbage. Have just spent half an hour trying to re-arrange delivery but without success. What is the point of having a QR code printed on the \"something for you\" card, if, when you scan the code, you are not taken directly to the basic details in the app?! Like other reviewers, I will just have to traipse off to the collection office.",
        "To book a simple redelivery you have to download the app and go through a full registration process. Then when you enter your parcel tracking number it doesn't pick up your details automatically, you have to re-enter them all again. Scanning the QR code on the card left by the postie didn't work either, just keep getting validation errors. Totally pointless app, seems I will have to visit the sorting office after all.",
        "Every time I attempt to open app the response is we will open and install it soon, !!!!!. One week later same old, same old, response.... As useful as a chocolate teapot. Any thoughts ??? I would LOVE to give a 5 star, but not today Tried again one month later still nothing,...a word comes to mind",
        "Useless app, will not allow me to print the label. Comes up with message saying there was an error processing my request. Booked a collection, so they are collecting my parcel with no label on it tomorrow.!! Cannot find record of order online either. Send query, will have to wait up to 10 days for a reply.",
        "Sent to download this from the site, but doesn't do anything more than the site. By that, I mean neither allows me to rearrange delivery of a parcel with tracking number and no other option left for me to do so. At least I can depend on Amazon to refund me (though I will be out of pocket as losing out on item I got as a cheap add on)",
        "Great until last update Used to be able to give my deliveries a meaningful name, but since yesterday's update can't do it anymore. With several deliveries on the go, it makes it difficult to see which is which. Apart from that, it's quite good",
        "Rubbish. Cannot arrange redelivery online - now supposedly only available via this app. Long registration process. Then have to reenter address of parcel for redelivery (SAME AS MY REGISTERED ADDRESS!!) and the reference number, and then it says Validation Error. So now can't arrange redelivery, and have to go queue up in the office. Complete waste of time. But they got my email address for marketing, which is all they wanted",
        "Good app love you can name deliveries, however when you recieve a push notification and pull down your notification drawer usually there isn't enough room to display the full notification so I press on it assuming it will open the app and display the notification in full but it doesn't it just opens the app normally and the notification is lost. Otherwise a great app.",
        "It's unacceptable to make you download an app to use their redelivery service. The app crashed multiple times and was very slow when trying to sort the redelivery as well so its not fit for purpose. You want people to stay home, well let them organise on the website, or at the very least get some better programmers.",
        "Disappointed. Received card for missed delivery so I thought I'll rearrange using QR code. Scanned and took me to download app. Went through all of that...scanned again...took me back to Google store...then went into app....had to enter all details on card manually...so why have a QR code. I'll be removing app.",
        "Just awful, forced me to make an account, hardly works with all its error messages. And when the postman doesn't fill in the failed delivery card properly, you don't have all the info to fill in the boxes for a reattempt delivery .... Error... Error...",
        "Annoying you have to type your full address in to register. Yup, the royal mail app doesn't have a postcode lookup. Sending parcels? Get ready to enter your address as the sender AGAIN. Want to view your collections, you have to enter the number, they're not stored. Come on Royal mail, think!",
        "Excellent app, however few fixes I'd like to see. 1 After you name an item, the tracking number dissappears in the list replaced with the name. 2 allow a gap between the numbers for easier reading ie FE 1234 1234 GB 3 Allow the option to rearrange the list of items.",
        "You have to type your full address in to register and again when choosing collection option. Shocking that royal mail app doesn't have a postcode lookup! After entering all details over and over again I get validation error and no other options. Useless app.",
        "For buying postage, it's almost perfect. I use this to post items that I make for my Etsy page, and it's mostly really good. Will be close to a 5* for that as soon as they include international postage.",
        "Wouldn't let me so a redelivery. Had to use website. Not a useful app and now uninstalled it Not only that! I even arranged for it to be delivered next door as I wouldn't be in. No attempt made to that address.....they went straight to depot. Just time wasters!",
        "Only ever used the app for tracking but see it does do much more. I was struggling with deleting past delivered items. Contacted support and two days later I had a remedy. Simply involve swiping right and tapping the delete that appears. Swift help.",
        "Just installed app. Good idea but no provision store a profile so you have to insert your own details twice every time. Once for return details and again for billing details. Very long winded. Love the parcel box idea though.",
        "Try updating package tracking once in a while, it might work as a package tracker instead of an app for a royal mail advertising . A piece of s*%t. Don't download, you will be better of asking a tree outside you will get more information of where your package is.",
        "Downloaded the app to try track a parcel or find a way to speak to an actual human not a voice guided system that doesn't have the correct options, nothing available. The website is also useless and their call center is even worse.",
        "AP worked perfectly. I've been waiting a long time for this to become available. Already used to arrange collection for about 8 packages now and each one was collected and delivered on time. So it's goodbye Hermes forever.",
        "Awful, can't book redelivery as keep getting error message. When I try with the QR code it just takes me to the install app on google play, but the app is already installed. Can't do a thing with it. Now got to go to my local office which is miles away.",
        "Wow won't show when the collection office is open. Can't book a redelivery (error). Delivery advised 10:25am and 2:25pm turned up 90mins late. Postmen look to be working hard what's going on with the sit on their backsides crew.",
        "Like everything the Royal Mail does, a total crock. Why the hell should I have to 'register' just to track a parcel? Half-hearted app from an organisation that has no other service priority than constant excuses.",
        "Sign Up, gets as far as entering Mr or Mrs then fails to register typing in the rest of the form. This app needs a lot of work before it should be released. This is Sub Beta at best.",
        "Awful. Had to download app to get parcel redelivered, well I day redelivered, I will have to personally go to delivery office to collect and error message is saying contact administrator if message persists!!! Royal mail are a joke and this is with a massive price hike in stamp cost.",
        "Pointless app, the QR code sends you here and then it doesn't even work when you try to book a redelivery. Just do it on their website, its quicker and actually works.",
        "Just downloaded app tried to track a delivery....item couldn't be tracked as not yet sent out for delivery....15 minutes later postman knocked on the door and delivered the parcel!!! Will be deleting this app of no use!",
        "Utterly pointless and worse than a website. Had to enter all my details to register... and then enter them again for the redelivery. Pointless and a waste of 50Mb on my phone. What are you trying to achieve with this?",
        "Forced to download as your website wouldn't let me book a redelivery without the app... had to make an account , why? Then the actual redelivery, well it kept saying validation error contact site administrator. What a bullsh*t app and experience...",
        "Wish I could give this 0 stars. Apparnetly I can only arrange a re-delivery online and then the second i get halfway through the app said it cant validate. Awful service as always from Royal Mail.",
        "Terrible app. No option to scan QR code. Long and pointless registration that you then can't use any of the details from to pull through for delivery and have enter it all again. What a joke!",
        "Try fixing your delivery service before worrying about a app lost my parcel that's ment to be delivered last Tuesday can't tell me where it is took it 3 hours away from where I live even tho I ordered from a company 40 minutes away from my house by car tracking not updated since Tuesday morning 2.40am takes the p**s as needed the items for a fishing holiday so having to buy twice",
        "Added details address password etc etc then get a message \"error, sorry we are unable to deal with your request \". No next step or reason why or what to do next.",
        "You have to give ALL of your details to sign up and then you have to fill them all in again to have a parcel redelivered. Time consuming and pointless.",
        "Residential customer. Forced to use app, website doesn't produce printable file! Registered account doesn't retain any information. Forced to complete Sender name, address, email address and payment details FOR EVERY SINGLE SENT ITEM, then authorise every single transaction with bank. After 5 transactions Royal Mail merchant authorisation fails but doesn't explain why, you have to use alternative card. Needs a basket so we checkout once! Doesn't email PDF for printing. No Google pay! Terrible!!",
        "An ok app but could do better. Lets have notifications of live transit of trackable items and please keep us logged in, I click the box but have to log on everytime I want to check deliveries."
