For example the signal strength would be affected by whether you have the phone in your hand or in a pocket, if you are outdoors or indoors, if you are in a environment with metal that will cause reflected signals (e.g. public transport). Also signal strengths may be affected depending upon the model of phone you and the close contact has. The initial notifications do not include the exposure date (the exposure date is hidden away in the menu \"settings/other data menu\". The app also does not take into account vaccination status, whether the people were wearing masks at time of exposure, whether you were facing towards or away from a person at time of exposure, had protective screens around them and when you check into a venue you cant check out (so if you went for breakfast at a venue it would show you at that venue until it closes (so if its a pub that could perhaps be 14 hours later). so to improve the app I think the following should be considered Your vaccination status should be considered when calculating the risk All close contact & venue notifications should include the exposure date exposure date (and some kind of approximate time if possible) Exposure information should be clearly visible in menus not hidden away You should be able to check out of a venue Perhaps you can enter what setting you are in if you want to or the app takes into account the precautions in a venue after you check into a venue Vaccination status should be included in app and the app should take this into account when you have a close contact notification",

The full caps on age confirmation so early is a bit daunting. Drop the caps or give the font more weight. The main button text could look nice with less tracking and more weight.

Fortunately tested negative (PCR test) but when I entered the results on the app the code didn't work so I deleted and reinstalled it but then it no longer told me to self isolate. Plus the app drains the phone battery. What is the point of the app? Useless. \ud83d\udc4e",

        "content": "Very poor, previous versions allowed turning off tracing to save battery life, this one its impossible to use the app without having tracing turned on... Although not compulsory to have the app, any sort of social life is difficult without it, and I don't see why this control was taken off, I now have to keep turning it off or alternatively turning the Bluetooth off to save the battery.... It's not true that the battery isn't drained by this app, comment from developer appreciated?",
