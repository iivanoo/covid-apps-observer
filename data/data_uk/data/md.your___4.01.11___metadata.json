        "This App is really awesome! And is so much help and helpful to motivate you and pay more attention to yourself and how your feeling. It's like a friend thats there to help you! Thank you so much it has been so helpful!",
        "This is a really good app. I think it could use some more features like pain location and number scale.",
        "I have a headache today and app sent me almost strait to the doctor as a serious issue. Not sure one of headache is that serious and reason might be any. Also I would welcome dark version (theme) of the app. Headache and white screen is not good.",
        "I'm loving it. I loved the revamped UI design. Seems like I won't be needing another health app. Keep it up!",
        "Very easy to use. Simple layout and bold lettering.",
        "It was good but now I can't connect!",
        "This site is so great I get up go to bathroom come and get on Healthy Site and start my day in a healthy Positive Way all day",
        "Amazing experience, since you start using it it will become your main habit everyday. Very very good",
        "this is a really great app, you have any questions and you can't reach your doctor,they got the answers for you here thumb up",
        "I think this app is great it's a good way to keep track of your health. mind body and spirit",
        "Need Healthy Habits.....Great Choice....your in control....",
        "I really like it but really wish you could have dark mode feature please and thank you!!!!",
        "makes tracking my health much easier and has built in symptom checker too!",
        "plenty of information, good amount of advice, wasn't able to recommend healthy practices specific to my condition.",
        "it's great to determine if you need to go to the Dr, so easy to overlook symptoms but this app makes me look at the whole picture",
        "it helps you talk and let it out to where yourself is behind a glass door. there response is fast",
        "I really appreciate this app. It helps me focus on what I need to do to help myself.",
        "This app is really helping me. The prescription that given is really helpful",
        "There could be more choices as to things to track. More importantly, I've had notes that I've written disappear. I know if I get here and record things about my condition, I write a note and there aren't always notes.",
        "Very useful used few times a week.",
        "Good app motivating and easy to follow",
        "so far I'm liking this app. No problems yet.",
        "I like the facts n helpful tips and journaling..",
        "it very nice to have a Healthy app to improve body works",
        "A library if health answers and daily health education. A great way to work on self-care. I am always finding ways to help others and often forget \"me\". This app helps me to find ways to take care of me.",
        "great app for health .and .very education",
        "Gives me healthy tips evrry single day to remind me to take care of myself.",
        "So far this app is fairly good. I like that it's free and pretty simple and gives links to places which give more information on what you need. I feel like the chat bot shouldn't straight away diagnose you with a condition only after you answer a few easy questions, but overall I don't mind this app at all and it's good for keeping track of day to day life :)",
        "It really helps to journal how I'm feeling so I can look back when I need to. Very handy & helpful app.",
        "I rarely review apps but this app i just had to. The chatbot was phenomenal and gave me advise with what i should do. The only problem i had on this app is when only male and female was there when you start, I understand that you are trying to make this app better but it would be appreciated if you fix this sooner then later. Thank you.",
        "Not as expected when compared to description; less comprehensive overall. Seemed to function okay, didn't crash, operated smoothly, but did not meet expectations I had based on description. Cannot find a way to completely DELETE my account (I can log out, but not delete). Please delete my account. Thank you.",
        "Hello! I can't open the app after updating, it just shows blank page and then closes. I'm still on android version 5.1 if it helps. I really like this app as a health checker, hope it gets a fix soon.",
        "great tips and i can see day to day how I feel each mirning",
        "There's only one thing that would improve my experience with this app. I'd like the option to go back to the previous day to add or modify items in the daily tracker. Sometimes I forget to fill it in. I'd like the option of going back to fill in the info",
        "This is a great app that offers Daily insights, a helpful assistant, and a Symptom tracker, & a Health Journal where you can annotate anything you feel may be of relevance later. I love it!",
        "I Started using this app in 2018, it has become a part of me, whenever i change a phone, its the first app i think. You guys are so amazing for introducing this app thanks a lot",
        "Was kind of liking the app but it reset itself 5 days into the 4 week programs so I lost all progress. Not starting again, clearly a bug needs to be fixed.",
        "It is a great app, but my only complaint is that it won't always give a diagnosis, it will just say seek medical help immediately. But other than that this is a very good app.",
        "Notes don't save. It only has a back button which does not save the note.",
        "The app is really great in keeping you healthy. The Sympton checker is also great, but I don't think it should replace the hospital for users."
