This happens every single time i want to log in lately and I have tried uninstalling both on my phone and tablet... never works when i need it to (outside office hours when GP is closed, so you can't ring for results). So what's the point of having this App if it doesn't do what you need it for!? Been in touch with support by email several times.... no help. Uninstalled it now.",

Please coordinate (with documentation) or direct your users to the right place to track the virus. Concerning the app itself: Having come to this app based on an email about tracking COVID-19, I was surprised by how the COVID-19 information is not easy to find in the app. The app also hung up on me the first time I tried it.
