        "Still switched on yet it keeps telling me that my phone's location isn't switched on - BUT it is. I have also tried to do this via phone settings for location and from the app itself... however, there no screen buttons to do this. Update. Switch off contact tracing. Cancel reminders, wait a minute and switch back on. A pop-up window allows switching location back on. THIS HAS SINCE REVERTED TO THE ERROR MESSAGE AGAIN.",
        "Shows there is a notification but nothing within app. Notification shows as 'loading' but gets no further. Covid will be over before this app works as it should! Update: I followed the instructions from the reply and posted the feedback through the app. Despite claiming it is resolved, their FAQ reply was that it is a known issue and to resolve it remove notifications in your phone settings for the app and then reapply them! Really? Doesn't sound very 'resolved' to me...",
        "Stop giving me pointless notifications constantly. \"Loading...\" - I don't care. This app is a joke, and it's insane how much it must have cost to build. Update: following devs response the app is still giving me \"Loading...\" notifications constantly. Possibly more than before. I don't understand how you could possibly accidentally give people push notifications.",
        "App not loading again. What a joke. Poor Experience. The app continually shows a notification saying loading. Uninstalled and reinstalled but still showing notification. I have Uninstalled permanently. App not working again. This is the only app I have ever used, and I've used hundreds that has completely stopped working and showing loading. All this tax paper money for an app that keeps not working \ud83d\ude21",
        "Keeps flagging up a notification that disappears when you click on it to open the app, there's nowhere to view any notifications, no way of booking a test, it's all too vague *I've has a reply to this review, it doesn't cover the issue, the lock screen notifications say there's a message, when you click to open the app there's nothing to view for any messages or notifications",
        "Just noticed, every single review gets answered, the whole 100k, thats lot of hard work, and keeping on top of any bug in the software, they do deserve to be rated more than 1 \u2b50, google needs to add an area so everyone can see the problem is getting fixed, from the developers, a notice in the app area, with report bug button, this will improve the ratings for many apps, app is working with no issue \ud83d\udc4f keep up the good work which you are doing, please like so google can see this to add this\ud83d\udc4d",
        "Constant notifications now to say unable to check for exposure. .. That's because I've not left my house all week and I'm not draining my mobile battery so Bluetooth and location is turned off. I turn it on when I leave the house... Which is not very often at all. I will disable notifications for the app, which I suppose defeats the purpose but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
        "just crashes all the time, it doesn't really works and the info are very generics. I never received an helpful notification, yeah it does say if the area is on lockdown or n tier but it's something that you can find everywhere. In my area I had a lot of cases during last year but I never received nothing from this app. What's the purpose of this?",
        "Update: lost a couple of stars as now get temp notifications daily saying \"loading...\" some of which hang and can't be removed without force killing the app. Don't want that from an app where the appearance of a notification normally means I have to isolate for a couple of weeks!",
        "Update still working fine, whatever told me to isolate is now behaving. No more false isolate, instructions 4 star given. Despite false isolations, I've given it a third chance. Currently its behaving as I would expect. Its not giving isolation messages and that's because I'm not mixing still. Its 5 weeks with trace on and no more false positives. SO FAR. Ive marked it up to 3 and will see how it goes.",
        "I have been using this since the day of its release. It once told me that I had been in the same place as someone at a different time (but not where or when) and when I tapped to learn more, the message was gone. In all of that time, I have learned of only one person who has received an alert, and that was a government minister. Is this an expensive white elephant?",
        "This app told me I had been exposed to covid even though I had been self isolating and not left the house in seven days. Turns out my neighbour had it, and the bluetooth picked them up. If I hadn't already been self isolating, I would have needlessly had to do so due yo an erroneous reading!",
        "OK I'm prepared to accept using this app for the benefit of helping defeat covid. However it needs to allow you to read notifications without having to turn on location and Bluetooth. I won't turn on location at home since I don't wish to share Edit 18.03.21. Now down to 2* since you seem totally incapable of answering the question above. Turned on BT but app won't open unless location is turned on. Cannot receive any notifications. Useless.",
        "Burns through my battery. Needs location services turned on all the time for contact tracing which is ridiculous as it works off of bluetooth interaction. Update: continuously shows a loading notification and now for some reason is sending me notifications telling me to turn bluetooth and location on. I'm in bed asleep I don't need this app on",
        "This used to run silently in the background and I'd forget it was there. But I've had to reinstall it every day this week to get rid of the push notifications \"loading...\", and they're still coming!",
        "Code not recognised... error. Used this once successfully but now the database field doesnt allow scan of QR or recognise the code. My test starts LLC.... but unable to input into the field. Please allow free text input or fix field requirements. Unable to send my test results.",
        "Not great, get exposure notifications at the top of my screen but can't read enough to see what it's for, when I click the notification it just opens the app and there's nothing there. Seems kinda pointless and just used to track me...",
        "I second the other reviews that the new exposure notification is excessive. I rarely have Bluetooth on when at home and there is very little chance I'll get 'exposed' here. Previously it only gave a notification when I turned BT off, now I had to disable the notification altogether to get rid of it.",
        "I can certainly see the application of this app for some people, but as I suffer from chronic pain (suspected Ankylosing Spondylitis) and am virtually unable to leave my home without help from my husband, for me personally an alert when cases are on the increase nearby would be much more useful. Does this app use paid data? Because if so, it's truly useless to me. I can't afford that any more. And one last thing: leaving location and Bluetooth on is bad for battery life: this needs optimising!",
        "The constant intrusive popup notifications when I don't have Bluetooth on, because I'm at home, is becoming too much. It never used to be like this - before it would only happen when I initially turned Bluetooth off. I'm going to turn off notifications for it altogether, which isn't helpful either.",
        "Not leaving Bluetooth on constantly. I don't want the extra rf exposure (particularly 2.4ghz). Bluetooth's security record is also quite poor. I might be persuaded to ignore the security issue and turn it on whilst out or when my GPS location does not match home! However I would expect GPS location to be good enough (same supermarket, same time, esp considering people proximity != virus proximity). I understand wanting to avoid criticism of GPS in terms of big brother but priv policy or options.",
        "Venue trace doesn't work on my 3 month old phone... It's just a camera... 10/10 NHS Edit: month later, barcode scanning still doesn't load on my 3 month old phone. Apparently QR doesn't work on this device. Response below isn't relevant to device support.",
        "It does not seem possible to be able to report the result of a lateral flow test in the app - either I've missed something obvious or the huge amount of money spent on Test and Trace is seriously misspent in more ways than I had originally believed. I do hope it's the former.",
        "3* because it should be life changing, saddly no. When I got the message to isolate, it's 4days late The app is to much to fiddle with with the same information Easier to access else where Expected better",
        "I switch off bluetooth and GPS when I'm home alone, which is most of the time. Since its last update, this app nags me constantly about this, even when I mute it or force-stop it. Please treat users like adults.",
        "Totally hopeless app. Shameful waste of money. It is laughable that was first described as a \"world class\" app Never worked properly and badly designed at great expense... Will anyone take responsibility for its failure...suspect not!",
        "I got into the settings once and it showed me it scanned in the early hours of the morning! I was working with man who tested positive and I my app never picked it up.",
        "The app doesn't show current Venue Check-in or save Venue QR Code as this would save a lot of time searching for the venue's QR code that a lot of companies have now removed.",
        "Keep getting periods (11+ days) where exposure checks are not shown unless I open both the app and exposure settings. Sometimes I need to uninstall and reinstall the app for it to catch up.",
        "Just noticed that contact tracing has somehow turned itself off... Why didn't it warn me of this?? How long has it been like this?? The third most expensive thing humans have ever made, and it's risking my life by not working properly!",
        "The app has been loading all day and you can't close it. This happens quiet often. Please sort it out!!",
        "Seems ok but, the icon for financial help is not appearing, even though the positive test has started the timer.",
        "Can't enter test results! I've updated the app and uninstall and reinstalled it but still can't enter my test result. What a complete waste of public money!!",
        "Fine but given I am at home 99% of time with Bluetooth and Location turned off, can you stop notifying me about it. I'm obviously doing it on purpose.",
        "Had this app since it came out. Not had any alerts at all! I work in a school and have had many cases.",
        "Despite using the app correctly with bluetooth enabled, it failed to notify even my husband when I caught covid and entered the code as required. Useless!",
        "Rubbish I had been in contact with someone who yested positive but still no notifications come up also the app just shows scanning and gives no regular notifications. Useless app",
        "\"Loading...\" Notification will not go away. No reference number if told to isolate. All in all I'd expect more from an app that cost 70 times the development cost of Pok\u00e9mon Go to create. All in all a massive rip off of the British taxpayer for an app that doesn't work. I also know I've been close to people who have tested positive but have not been notified.",
        "Not starting, logged issue, asked the same questions again and again... Look like problem is not in the front of user screen...",
        "This app also won't allow you to input negative results from tests that were booked outside the app. It also doesn't accept results from labs like the Public Health England lab or NHS hospital, or as part of national surveillance testing conducted by the Office for National Statistics. It also comes up with the notification \"NHS Covid-19 Loading...\" after the phone has rebooted and this notification won't go away."
