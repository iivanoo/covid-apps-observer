    "comments": [
        "Fine when it works but frequently requires multiple login attempts, takes too long to load, and I don't love that it is trying to sell me stuff when I just want to use it to interact with my GP surgery. Lots can be improved and would be happy to provide feedback if the product team want to contact me.",
        "This app is 10 times better than Patient Access. It's very interactive and keeps the user up to date in many areas like health and well being, including your rights as a patient to having access to your records.",
        "Works very well for me. Useful for ordering repeat prescription. Records, including vaccinations, easy to check.",
        "I only use this app to order prescriptions. I can't book appointments through the app. Ordering prescriptions is quick and easy though.",
        "Bug fixes required - keeps crashing every time I request a prescription and cannot afford for the requests to not go through. Please fix.",
        "quick and easy to use not like other providers which are hit and miss with log in very good service",
        "Good, but the app freezes quite a lot. The full DNA results actually caused more questions that couldn't be answered due to a lack of clarity in the original answers. The questions around daily health involve a community question and if you aren't community minded in their opinion your score hits the floor. People can be happy without being involved in community. I use it daily just to register my covid status. Would I be using it otherwise, probably not.",
        "Cannot get on the app, click forgotten password, get emailed code, enter code, and it asks security question, answer question and get message too many failed attempts, account temporarily suspended, come back a month later, and get same message on first security question answer, so just how long is your idea of temporary?",
        "does not work correctly. the screen for ordering prescriptions never loads, so i cant order anything through the app. ive had this problem on my s8, s10 and now s20. i spoke to customer service via email and they didnt help at all and the issue is still not resolved. avoid",
        "Dreadful. It will let me in on laptop, but not on phone app. Wasted so much time. You could die waiting for the tech. What a dreadful state of affairs",
        "Can be glitchy. Biometric login often doesn't work.",
        "very useful service but no available appointments to see GP in whatever format is worrying!",
        "Been working great until today and now won't take password to log in",
        "not fully user friendly, it's not obvious how to get things done, needs some getting used to to navigate. otherwise works very well.",
        "Terrible! I'm always having issues on this app with accessing my medication and ordering it. It has caused me so much stress and has very negative impact on my mental health!",
        "great app. essential if you want your GP to update some of your case without having to answer the annoying questions about how much you smoke and drink. tell the truth because they will check",
        "order page seems to change each time I use it. Consequently, sometimes I think I've ordered and I haven't.",
        "Hardly ever works properly nowadays, all i want is to order a repeat prescription.",
        "Great for ordering repeat prescriptions. The additional health promoting notifications can be helpful at times too.",
        "overly complicated, confusing where and what to tap, biometrics usually does not work. Utter cr*p",
        "smashing app - can do everything necessary very easily and quickly",
        "Works well. Limited functionality - presumably due to government and surgery constraints",
        "Does not work properly on my Samsung s21 I cannot access my medical record at all.",
        "very easy to use and better than phoning for prescription",
        "bit slow today - edit: It is thankfully back up to speed today, though it means I'm unable to make a physical recording of it.",
        "App is now working again. And I'm happy again.\ud83d\ude01 But apprehensive...",
        "Fantastic. Only issue I had was with reconnecting to new service but just needed to log out and back in rather than re-install. It's a great start of an app and I hope it gets regular updates and improvements.",
        "Great service easy to use",
        "Easy and efficient to use",
        "decent medical app, had no problems.",
        "Support staff are wonderful, patient but latest app is not easy to navigate & when I finally manage to find where to order medications, I get repeated notifications about the message box having 'special characters' even when it's blank. Seriously, I've wasted hours on different days reloading the app, try typing a sentence or removing it. I've only a few days of meds left. I've tried again, done exactly the same & got error notification & leaving then coming back, it's accepted! Bizarre",
        "Cannot log on. Password never recognised and biometric logon never works. I have had to delete the app and reinstall it, add a new password (same as the old one) and can then order repeat prescription. That happens every time I need to reorder. Have reported the problems to the admin of the app but problems persist",
        "Was a good app to check, history, make appointments and order repeat prescription. But lately I can't log on keep saying password or login is incorrect. When I reset password it works from the email link. Also would be good if e-prescription pharmacy could be set when requesting prescription so you don't have to leave a message. If log in and prescription issue fixed would be happy to rate 5 star \ud83d\ude2a",
        "Just got worse, all I want is to access the GP services, I don't want any of the other bloat! The latest update has turned documents from the doctors into a html link! Now I have no way of saving a PDF copy which was the feature I used the most. It hasn't fixed the size problem, trying to print to PDF gives 13 pages for a few page document, not even changing the paper size to A2 works! Definitely on my list to change services to an alternative access method.",
        "very efficient, great service!!",
        "Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.",
        "So far looks like a good general health app as well as being a clear, easily understood gateway into GP online systems.",
        "fairly easy to use but the app is a bit unstable - slow at times and some screens don't load on 1st or 2nd attempt",
        "sometimes when they make changes, you have to spend time searching for the prescription ordering tab,which should be the most prominent thing on the site, not on a sub page",
        "Was good at first but now seems more concerned with getting you to fill in stupid health questions than keeping it simple to follow. Always takes me a while to find out where I order repeat prescriptions."
