        "Wonderful app with all necessary information for booaitng immunity ..I recommend that they work on colour contrast .. for 3 shades (light blue(need of self care) , yellow(ayurvedic immunity ) and yellowish green (Ayush healthcare ) it was hard to read with white text .. kindly change the shade of text to black in these colours",
        "Good initiative by AYUSH ministry. Need of time. Requires improvement in app user friendliness. Need to include different languages. Add FAQ about what & where: about filling forms. Clarity is required in consideration of general layman public. Thankx",
        "Nice initiative by Ministry, the interface is easy to use, some more features may be added in the future. Not sure whether it's available for iPhone or not Hope this app will help in generating a great ammount of evidence.",

        "My own suggestion is that this app should also have Hindi language so that people who do not know English can understand it and can use it well.",
        "Since it is based on Ayurveda, it would be great if released in vernacular languages like Telugu. The mobile number is mandatory for this app. I don't find it mandatory",
        "Very good effort. But I believe it came from ministry of ayush not from ministry of Ayurveda to give only Ayurveda a priority what about siddha and unnani. I believe you will update that too with including kaba sura kudineer also for imunity booster",
        "This app like arogya setu and Ayush Sanjivani app should be included in UMANG APP in another section of HEALTH. There in UMANG APP, should contain some different sections for all opportuinity. One folder for all central government app. Another for all state government. Then ministry wise all the app should be there. Then this app will be exact and proper for all citizens. If there would be different app for different problem but all are government related app what is the meaning of that!",

Request you to arrange to add this field in the app. This will help in compiling more specific details about dose of medicine.",
        "At this time an app was needed to guide peoples to improve their immune system and fight against covid-19. Ayush Sanjivani is the app which can do it. It contains all the solutions of problems arrived in its absence. Also, it has very small size.",
        "I got the otp............., much more information and daily tips and updates should ne available , and be shared to public",
        "Why Union Territory of Ladakh is not there in \"Select State\" option?? I can't use it properly because of that error.",

Kindly discuss this opinion with your homeopathy expert team and update the app",

        "Does not get OTP even thogh well connected network and without Verification can not use.",
        "Very Good App, but require more language option.",
        "Very nice and helpful app i got a lot information from this app about the health immunity and prevention from covid-19.. Thanku ayush ministry",
        "This is a good initiative by AYUSH ministry. App interface is quite okk But as a naturopathy and yoga student personal I am not satisfied because the app is not showing them as main mode of prevention and improving immunity and health.
