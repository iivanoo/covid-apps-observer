The app provides easy-to-use site search capabilities, which allows you to switch from one site to another quickly by either using the search bar menu, settings or by selecting the \u201cworld icon\u201d to view all available sites. The app provides information on building locations, Airbus shuttle services, links to public shuttle services (currently only for Toulouse & Hamburg) and different points of interests like entrance points, car parks, defibrillators, restaurants, etc. The information is provided on a site basis and new supported site information (Buildings, POIs, etc) will appear over time.",
