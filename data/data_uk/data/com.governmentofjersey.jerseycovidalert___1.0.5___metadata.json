        "Pretty straightforward. NHS app has built in QR scanner for venue check-in which this app is missing.",
        "Installed the app on my Sony L1, launched the app and it completely locked the phone up, I re started the phone and it had corrupted my SD card so every thing on there is lost and needs re-installing, It deleted icons from my home screen so I am not happy with it",
        "Constantly getting \"cannot contact server\" error message. Edit The fixed version does now work. Easy to use. Now a 4 star app (can't give 5 stars until I've met someone with covid!,)",
        "Keep needing to install/uninstall due to connectivity issues but nothing wrong with my wifi.",
        "Can't get through to the track and trace number. Pointless",
        "Says no Internet connection the whole time. Update has fixed issues",
        "Tell you to press continue and just times out, tried reinstalling and all other easy fixes to no avail",
        "The layout is simplistic and it is working fine for me \ud83d\ude42",
        "Does now work with oppo reno 2. App keeps crashing after 2nd page.",
        "App constantly says the notifications are turned off but they are on Android",
        "Personally I think the Channel Islands as a whole should use a combined system instead of separatist nature. I also don't get why NHS Scotland app separate from the NHS Covid-19 England & Wales App though both parts of the UK and same island. The Jersey App 'Latest' & 'share' tabs content is useful and all the UK Covid ENS apps should include the feature. All UK ENS Apps should feature parity on NHS Eng&Wales App - QR codes etc tho Jersey 'Latest' tab all the UK Covid apps could learn from!",
        "I have tried to load this app for 2 days now and every time a box appears saying \"something went wrong our end, please try again\" . Maybe the IT people need to back to the drawing board!!",
        "Says installed on my Galaxy J6 and app will appear shortly but after 24 hours and multiple attempts to reinstall no joy",
        "Anybody who installs this is an absolute moron!",
        "Waiting for the app to download. 4 Days!!!!!!. Useless!!.",
        "not compatible with loolipop 5.1",
        "Government surveillance scam, sheep fell for it!",
        "Good information"
