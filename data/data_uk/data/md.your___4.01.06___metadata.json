I feel like the chat bot shouldn't straight away diagnose you with a condition only after you answer a few easy questions, but overall I don't mind this app at all and it's good for keeping track of day to day life :)",
        "Unable to register with email address. Keep on receiving error message, even after uninstall and reinstall.",
        "It is a great app, but my only complaint is that it won't always give a diagnosis, it will just say seek medical help immediately. But other than that this is a very good app.",
        "Was kind of liking the app but it reset itself 5 days into the 4 week programs so I lost all progress. Not starting again, clearly a bug needs to be fixed."
