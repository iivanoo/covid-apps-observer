About 60% of the time it will let you go through the entire process, carefully keying everything in, before it freezes at the payment screen. Its a great idea, in theory... Would be awesome if it worked reliably or remembered any previous info! Bit of a first world problem, I know but do allow 10-20 mins & get a cushion to scream into for that 3rd attempt when it still doesnt work! \ud83d\ude14",
