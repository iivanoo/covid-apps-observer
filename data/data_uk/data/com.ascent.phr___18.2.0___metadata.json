        "Edit: this is working again now - but only on my old phone (which is too knackered to sell so ok). My new phone runs colorOS, (realme6), which might have something to do with it. Disney+ doesn't work on it because of this... Edit: I can't get to the bit where you order a precriotion. It just buffers endlessly. 4/5/2020 Works well for me.",
        "Quite a good app. All your medical info in one place. Only problem is when I send a message, no matter what it's about, I only get 'null' as a reply which isn't very helpful.",
        "AVOID THIS USELESS APP This app is nothing but logging users out, doesn't accept complex passwords, unlinks your GP account and then loads up half the time without any styling. Update 2020 Just just as useless in 2019 but now with 100% more notifications to drive you up the wall. Anything I try to do on this non-functioning app it just crashes. The NHS services are also tucked away making GP services harder to find and use.",
        "Currently not recognising the biometric login. I change login via password which worked, but now I can't use GP services to order my repeat prescription, just see a continuous evergreen logo which I presume means it's trying to connect.",
        "Too many irrelevant pop up links when logging in making it difficult to get to the bit I need (repeat prescription). I can get through them but others may struggle",
        "when I try to make an appointment it just says no appointments available \u2014 always. Prescription ordering works fine.",
        "This service works well generally, however I find keep updating of choices on screen confusing at times. Sorry.",
        "the worst app I have on my phone. I only have it to enable me to order repeat prescriptions and this is 10times more effort than another app our gp previously supported. in short its rubbish.",
        "excellent quick and easy app, can order at any time, nothing to collect. prompt service",
        "Absolute Godsend these apps... When your a working person online appointment booking is such a breeze!!",
        "This app is easy to follow and use, I have been using it since the beginning of lock down with no problems, and all my meds have been ready for me on time giving me peace of mind. I would recommend this app to anybody who have serious underlying medical issues, prescriptions ordered and delivered without having to come in contact with anybody,",
        "not as good as it could be ,why no way of uploading documents other than pictures and why not visible to members of the surgery by default?",
        "I love this it's easy to use and i can make appointments and i can order my prescriptions without going the doctors",
        "This app is truly awful. Half the buttons don't even work, constantly logs you out and won't allow you to log in again. I've ended up having to use their website instead, which is also awful. If you're looking for an app to connect to your practice, for the love of God don't use this one. 1 star because I can't give it negative stars",
        "too many options. too complicated to do simple things like repeat prescription.",
        "This was a good App till it started promoting Pharmacy2u right in the App when we were going through the first Covid peak. Unfortunately I opted for that which never worked out and I had to switch back to my old pharmacy. Since then this App continues to update repeats in a haphazard manner repeatedly bringing up the same data when I request repeats. It is sad that after a long time I am uninstalling it. Business should never be given precedence to the core functions of people using this App.",
        "Great service yo be able to go to local Tesco pharmacy late as I work away from my home and don't get back until late and docs are closed",
        "I have been using same from almost the first week.off course when you first released the app it had one or two problems, then again which new release does not have problems. Seen a couple of comments saying difficult to understand.all I can say is that they must have a different program open to me.",
        "Excellent app. all my records and simple repeat prescription ordering.",
        "Was working but isn't now. Can't get prescriptions . Says not allowed even though I've used the service many times before.",
        "Extraordinary initial interface, more like a game for the sharp eyed than a practical aid for those in pain or in a hurry. 'Playful\" with tiny print. I suppose you'd get used to it.",
        "So far its not too intrusive. Good, helpful in aspects of physical ailments. And dieting, to remove the pandemic belly, etc, etc and maintaining physical fitness, and general well being. A tad long winded application details, but if you need insight into better health then n this is the way to go \ud83d\ude42",
        "My phone has facial recognition: does this app? No, don't be silly. It's all in a Google Security API that no 'developer' is able to understand yet. Agree about the interface; it is very poorly thought out. And it's not about me, is it? It's about selling services. Don't you just hate what's happening with our NHS?",
        "Atrocious app. Won't let me log in when I know 100% that my credentials are correct. When I click to reset the password, it does nothing. How can we ever log in then?!? Awful.",
        "Great app for ordering repeat prescription. also tips on your health..",
        "The app worked fine up until very recently where now I can't do anything in it and the buttons are unresponsive. The Customer Service team recommended reinstalling the app but this did nothing.",
        "Good app, fairly intuitive & simple to use.",
        "This is a Brilliant service so easy to use.",
        "Unstable keeps telling me to log on when I already am keeps crashing",
        "Frustrating after the last update it constantly asks for the screen lock code making it very difficult to get access to the app. Is anyone else having trouble",
        "Having major problems with your app it keeps logging me out I then have to reset my password this has happened twice in a week it's completely unusable now and I can't order my meds really really bad...",
        "Prescription function issues when trying to order. Galaxy S10. Used to work fine, now all but useless to me.",
        "takes too long to find page to order repeats.",
        "great app for booking go appointments and repeat prescription request",
        "I will leave this rating as '2' as a warning to other potential users that there is an issue. ie that sometimes the App stops recognising your password and that, despite their best endeavours and lots of communications between us, Evergreen Life have not been able to resolve this issue. Hopefully one day they will get to the bottom of it as it is otherwise a pretty good App (and the Web access is good) but there are I know other similar Apps available that are probably worth looking at first.",
        "The app is not accepting either my PIN nor my password. I can only assume the app has crashed",
        "Convenient and reliable.",
        "Nice & simple to use & updated immediately by surgery",
        "simple straightforward and reliable",
        "so easy to navigate and use..."
