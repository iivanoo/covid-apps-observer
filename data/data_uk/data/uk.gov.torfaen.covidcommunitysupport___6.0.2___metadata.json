    "description": "The Torfaen Community Support mobile App is part of the council\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s Shielding Scheme to protect the most vulnerable residents instructed to stay in isolation.  The council, with the help of community volunteers and community groups, will coordinate and provide direct support, particularly to those residents in receipt of letters from the NHS who are unable to rely on family, friends or community support throughout the period of shielding.\r\n\r\nThe Torfaen Community Support mobile App will enable the council to match volunteers to the needs of the most vulnerable and help the council\u2019s newly mobilised Support Hub to operate more efficiently, which will be particularly helpful as resident\u2019s needs grow and volunteer skills and availability changes over time. Once the App is downloaded, volunteers and vulnerable people can apply to participate in the scheme by providing some basic information. The council\u2019s Support Hub will match suitable volunteers to requests for support, considering where people live, whether they have a car and the type of help they have said they can offer.",
