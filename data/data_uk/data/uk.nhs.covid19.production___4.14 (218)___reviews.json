Thanks for responding to the query - the article doesn't cover my scenario as i have, As I had both phones in the same pocket pretty much all the time. I use one for scanning it at work and one for personal stuff. so i know both work. Does the notification only count at the start for the neighbouring device? So if i left one phone somewhere else for a period of time then put it back into proximity with the other, it wouldn't alert. and if so what would be the isolation duration if one phone was counting down the isolation period, would the other start from 10 days or the remaining period on the first phone?",

I had no warning via the app. On 22nd, he did 3 lateral flow tests, followed by a PCR test, all positive. He updated the app where he's been advised to self isolate now until 1st August, yet NO alert on my phone? Both our Bluetooths have been on, apps upto date. Surely the app is faulty and defeats the purpose as I've been in contact with him throughout?",

        "content": "The app needs a lot of improvement Not convinced the app can judge distance correctly it relies on signal strength of Bluetooth signal but as far as i can see this could vary significantly depending upon the environment the phone is in and other factors . For example the signal strength would be affected by whether you have the phone in your hand or in a pocket, if you are outdoors or indoors, if you are in a environment with metal that will cause reflected signals (e.g. public transport). Also signal strengths may be affected depending upon the model of phone you and the close contact has. The initial notifications do not include the exposure date (the exposure date is hidden away in the menu \"settings/other data menu\". The app also does not take into account vaccination status, whether the people were wearing masks at time of exposure, whether you were facing towards or away from a person at time of exposure, had protective screens around them and when you check into a venue you cant check out (so if you went for breakfast at a venue it would show you at that venue until it closes (so if its a pub that could perhaps be 14 hours later). so to improve the app I think the following should be considered Your vaccination status should be considered when calculating the risk All close contact & venue notifications should include the exposure date exposure date (and some kind of approximate time if possible) Exposure information should be clearly visible in menus not hidden away You should be able to check out of a venue Perhaps you can enter what setting you are in if you want to or the app takes into account the precautions in a venue after you check into a venue Vaccination status should be included in app and the app should take this into account when you have a close contact notification",
