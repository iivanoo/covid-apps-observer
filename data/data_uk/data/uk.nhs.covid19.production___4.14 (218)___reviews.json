        "content": "The app needs a lot of improvement Not convinced the app can judge distance correctly it relies on signal strength of Bluetooth signal but as far as i can see this could vary significantly depending upon the environment the phone is in and other factors . For example the signal strength would be affected by whether you have the phone in your hand or in a pocket, if you are outdoors or indoors, if you are in a environment with metal that will cause reflected signals (e.g. public transport). Also signal strengths may be affected depending upon the model of phone you and the close contact has. The initial notifications do not include the exposure date (the exposure date is hidden away in the menu \"settings/other data menu\". The app also does not take into account vaccination status, whether the people were wearing masks at time of exposure, whether you were facing towards or away from a person at time of exposure, had protective screens around them and when you check into a venue you cant check out (so if you went for breakfast at a venue it would show you at that venue until it closes (so if its a pub that could perhaps be 14 hours later). so to improve the app I think the following should be considered Your vaccination status should be considered when calculating the risk All close contact & venue notifications should include the exposure date exposure date (and some kind of approximate time if possible) Exposure information should be clearly visible in menus not hidden away You should be able to check out of a venue Perhaps you can enter what setting you are in if you want to or the app takes into account the precautions in a venue after you check into a venue Vaccination status should be included in app and the app should take this into account when you have a close contact notification",

The full caps on age confirmation so early is a bit daunting. Drop the caps or give the font more weight. The main button text could look nice with less tracking and more weight.

The fact it needs Bluetooth means that your battery life will be affected instead of connecting to mobile data and using a service either similar to or connected to the native map apps (Google Maps for Android). In theory, it's a good idea, but it's horrifically unoptimised and is only useful because you need it to go into places.",
