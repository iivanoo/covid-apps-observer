        "Cannot log on. Password never recognised and biometric logon never works. I have had to delete the app and reinstall it, add a new password (same as the old one) and can then order repeat prescription. That happens every time I need to reorder. Have reported the problems to the admin of the app but problems persist",
        "Was a good app to check, history, make appointments and order repeat prescription. But lately I can't log on keep saying password or login is incorrect. When I reset password it works from the email link. Also would be good if e-prescription pharmacy could be set when requesting prescription so you don't have to leave a message. If log in and prescription issue fixed would be happy to rate 5 star \ud83d\ude2a",
        "Support staff are wonderful, patient but latest app is not easy to navigate & when I finally manage to find where to order medications, I get repeated notifications about the message box having 'special characters' even when it's blank. Seriously, I've wasted hours on different days reloading the app, try typing a sentence or removing it. I've only a few days of meds left. I've tried again, done exactly the same & got error notification & leaving then coming back, it's accepted! Bizarre",
        "Just got worse, all I want is to access the GP services, I don't want any of the other bloat! The latest update has turned documents from the doctors into a html link! Now I have no way of saving a PDF copy which was the feature I used the most. It hasn't fixed the size problem, trying to print to PDF gives 13 pages for a few page document, not even changing the paper size to A2 works! Definitely on my list to change services to an alternative access method.",
        "Lots of functionality doesnt work because GP hasn't signed up to provide it but was does work is quite good. Most annoying aspect is when there is an upgrade due and you cannot log in and use it until you upgrade...but it doesnt tell you that it just makes out you got you credentials wrong.",
        "sometimes when they make changes, you have to spend time searching for the prescription ordering tab,which should be the most prominent thing on the site, not on a sub page",
        "Was good at first but now seems more concerned with getting you to fill in stupid health questions than keeping it simple to follow. Always takes me a while to find out where I order repeat prescriptions.",
        "good app but was simpler to use in earlier versions; a bit cumbersome UI, the most popular shortcuts (e.g. repeat prescription) are not immediately obvious.",
        "Easy to use you can also leave notes for your surgery to sort for you too...perfect for me...you can view personal info about yourself and it has a password to secure all personal information \ud83d\ude42",
        "The app is very good, but my surgery currently uses very little of the functionality. So it's a lot of screens for just prescriptions.",
        "Even after making a note of my password, it still told me it was wrong. The last few times I've logged in I've had to set up a new one. Not the best app in the world",
        "So easy to download and use. Should you need any help or advice the Staff are most friendly and understanding.",
        "Rubbish app. Cannot access any information recently \ud83d\ude15. Its supposed to make GP access easier. Its such a pain.",
        "The app no longer loads up, I used it to order repeat prescriptions now it won't do anything",
        "ok App doesn't really do much in the way of looking at your medical records or being able to book appointments at the doctors etc. not really sure why I still have it installed tbh",
        "easy to use, straight forward services. very happy with this app.",
        "too many options. too complicated to do simple things like repeat prescription.",
        "Won't connect to GP practice, so of no use to me. I tried asking on \"live chat\" but just got an automated referral to changing gp practice - not what I wanted to do at all.",
        "Great app linked to my gp. so much info and hassle.free ordering a repeat prescription",
        "Seems to not ever load the prescriptions section which was the main reason I got it.",
        "Always easy to use and keeps you up to date at all times.",
        "Excellent app - ordering repeat prescriptions is so easy.",
        "Do not hesitate, this is the app you need, forget the rest, just started using it and it's brilliant.",
        "Not been able to order a prescription for the last 6 months using app. Was fine before that.",
        "I find the app easy to use and so far have not had any issues.",
        "It's OK, but the biometric login fails every time",
        "every so often I have problems logging in but on the whole its good",
        "Easy to use and order repeat prescriptions.",
        "Excellent, no hassle with telephone calls.",
        "It should be more simple than it is. Asking many confidential questions and information.???",
        "Great service & easy to use.",
        "I've never had a problem with my repeat orders getting to my Gp.",
        "so easy to order repeat prescriptions, would recommend to everybody",
        "very easy to operate. It's saves time for patients.",
        "login makes you go crazy and doesn't let you in",
        "This app is easy to follow and use, I have been using it since the beginning of lock down with no problems, and all my meds have been ready for me on time giving me peace of mind. I would recommend this app to anybody who have serious underlying medical issues, prescriptions ordered and delivered without having to come in contact with anybody,",
        "bio security does not work fingerprint works on all apart from this the most important one",
        "very good efficient fast easy service",
        "Currently not recognising the biometric login. I change login via password which worked, but now I can't use GP services to order my repeat prescription, just see a continuous evergreen logo which I presume means it's trying to connect.",
        "This app is truly awful. Half the buttons don't even work, constantly logs you out and won't allow you to log in again. I've ended up having to use their website instead, which is also awful. If you're looking for an app to connect to your practice, for the love of God don't use this one. 1 star because I can't give it negative stars"
