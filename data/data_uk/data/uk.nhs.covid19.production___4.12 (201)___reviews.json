I found out later my neighbour had covid test return positive. So it must travel through walls. I could have lost 10 days wages because of this, they couldn't say where I was exposed. I'd had zero contact with neighbour.",

If you don't check out, then it marks that you've been there until 23.59 that day, even if you were in at 08.00 for 10mins. So if someone reports testing positive and visited the same place as you on the same day, you both may be recorded as having visited at the same time and be contacted, even if that wasn't the case!

The full caps on age confirmation so early is a bit daunting. Drop the caps or give the font more weight. The main button text could look nice with less tracking and more weight.
