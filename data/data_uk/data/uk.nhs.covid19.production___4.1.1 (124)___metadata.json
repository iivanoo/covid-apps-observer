        "Absolutely useless. Can't even do the simple task of providing the correct date that isolation ends and completely fails in it's primary function of alerting you to exposure. I received a notification a full week after coming into contact with the virus at which point I'd already had symptoms, a test and a positive result back. What is the point?",
        "It has worked fine for me so far. Very useful for checking my local restrictions. I have never booked a test or been told to self isolate via this app so I cannot comment on those features. However, from what I have experienced, an all round good app. It will become more effective the more people install it.",
        "I am sitting 2 metre away from my housemate who tested positive 2 days ago and not receiving the notification. Ridiculous. Don't they think to fix this, since the sole purpose of the app to detect people who tested positive around you. Also, would be great if they create some sort of a department to deal with customers complaints and requests since i am unable to apply for the isolation claim because of this. Here I am sitting with my friend just two of us all Christmas locked it. Bollocks",
        "Appears to work... I guess, but I had a thought! I remember reading somewhere that \"people don't care about contact tracing\", with regards to being called by contact tracers. But surely this is down to people not wishing to answer their phones to unknown callers? So here's a thought... Could you not tell the country what the phone number you will be called from is or when people install this app, make it so that it also creates a contact tracing contact on the phone?",
        "I'm living with my partner who has unfortunately recently tested positive for Covid. Her app is clearly displaying her countdown period of isolation. However, my app has yet to receive the information from her device informing me to isolate. I am obviously isolating. My phone shares the same charging station has my partners and are well within 2m of each other for most of the day. Can you please tell me the purpose of the app? Oh, all Bluetooth enabled, latest update etc... Thank you.",
        "Doesn't work, loads the blue splash screen and then the app closes. It did work previously but now it always closes, have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same result. Pixel 3a Update: had to inform support 3 times which phone and os I was using which considering that's supplied with the support ticket is great service. After responding that I can't update to latest version of Apple app as I'm on an android they stopped replying so still no working app.",
        "Whenever I receive a notification, I see the badge, but the information disappears immediately, meaning I don't get the details. As these notifications are likely in response to contact tracing, this is worrying. I can see that in response to similar reviews, the developers state that any actionable notifications are visible when you log in. This is not true at all. I have been sat next to my mum when we both received notifications. Hers simply disappeared, we had to use my lock screen.",
        "The app is great and all and the NHS are incredible, what I don't understand is why it takes so long to roll out an update now the days self isolating have been reduced. The app says 12 days currently, the text message I had says 10. It really shouldn't be difficult to update a number! You're playing with people's lives!! Sort it out.",
        "I have posted pictures and tagged you in twitter, it worked then the last week it just force closes all the time and won't allow me to open the app at all. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with the same problem. Update - this issue was rectified weeks later, with another new update of the app the app is having the exact same issue for the last few days.",
        "Keeps crashing and saying not responding. There is not much to this app for the end user. Obviously its objective is to sit in the background and provide alerts when needed. For the past week though it has been crashing and saying app is not responding a fair amount. I have just tried to open it and it does not have the usual screen or display. Seems to be buggy. EDIT: I have sent feedback and the 'crash' data via the report problem option that comes up with the app keeps stopping notification.",
        "It took one week for the app to tell me and my partner we were in contact with someone with covid, that whole time we were unaware going to work. Tell me how an app thats supposed to immediately notify me, that pings off everytime I walk past someone in the street who may have had it or been ill with it, didn't tell me instantly to self isolate and stay at home? Its almost as if that's intentional",
        "The app is inaccurate. It has not updated my area to the correct tier more than 6 hours after the change came into force. In areas of poor internet connectivity it is not possible to use the scanner for checking into a venue. You will still need to use the paper system.",
        "Downloaded as requested. Tested positive 5 days ago and still no contact. My husband still hasn't had notification that he has been a close contact. This is meant to be our \"saving grace\" yet my close contacts wouldn't even know they've been near a positive if I hadn't told them!",
        "I've seen others had issues with this but personally I think it's a very useful tool. Like the QR log in facility although I've not gone to bars / pubs much due to tier level. It does help though knowing the NHS will contact you if you've been in contact. Like that it also gives you your local tier level and the rules for that tier. All in all a good tool given the pandemic level.",
        "The only real useful part of this app would be notification of being in contact with someone with covid. However, the notification is only in the form of a push notification that disappears when you click on it and the app holds no trace of this notification which is dreadful design. I got a notification today that I naturally clicked on to see what it was only to realise it was from the NHS app and now I have no idea what it says. Who thought that was a good idea!",
        "Update - The issue has now been fixed with latest Android update. App crashes on opening for over a week now. Raised the issue on their website, still no fix. I've updated, uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. Right now I have no idea if I am being exposed to Covid or ability to check in.",
        "The app seems to be fine, however, the message received mentioning that one may have been exposed to someone with covid and to self isolate seems to disappear very quickly from the screen and cannot be read again. Could not your team work on a text message being sent too so the person is informed via app and text message ? I could not re-read the message on the app as unfortunately, it went off the screen very fast..",
        "OK I'm prepared to accept using this app for the benefit of helping defeat covid. However it needs to allow you to read notifications without having to turn on location and Bluetooth. I won't turn on location at home since I don't wish to share such info with all the other snooping apps. I can't see why the NHS app needs location for you to read a notification?",
        "My experience with this app did work. I was notified that I had to self isolate, followed by a phone call from work that there had been 2 people who had tested positive In our department (I must admit, the app would be better if the app told you where you was suspected to have come in contact with someone who had reported their results).",
        "Living with a covid case and app hasn't notified me. An update a while ago meant you had to manually select local authority, which would've been fine if it didn't disable scanning until you chose. Only spotted this on my partner's phone when we went for a test, so has potentially not been scanning for several months. Other than that, fine. Nice to have an isolation countdown at least",
        "My husband has tested positive and the app is still yet to tell me I've been in contact with someone and could be at risk. We both have the app, he entered his test result yet my app still hasn't alerted me 24hrs later! If it can't trace someone living in the same house, how is it meant to trace the wider public?",
        "Good app, however when I had a positive encounter previously it didn't tell me where or when, which was a bit frustrating as I'd been out to two shops with my support bubble (mum) and wanted to be able to tell her if she needed to isolate too. Other than that, has been working fine. Feel much safer having this app on and knowing if I've been in contact with someone who tested positive, I'll know about it.",
        "This app is trash. Displays notifications but when you click on them to read, they vanish. Add a log to view all notifications! The false notifications are only causing unnecessary worry and confusion. Would be useful to know location where other people got covid from. This app also disables itself when you release new updates, i only know its not working when I load it myself and it asks me for my area again. I wish I could downvote all your worthless copy/paste responses to everyone on here.",
        "The app did appear to work and I had a 7 day isolation notice a few weeks ago. Although I have not changed anything since, a check on Covid-19 exposure notifications in my android settings shows that no checks have taken place for 2 weeks. My wife's phone is checking several times a day so why isn't mine? I have reinstalled and immediately it carried out a exposure check....so why not for two weeks?",
        "It said in the Bluetooth menu that the app had \"last checked for potential exposure on 2nd November\". Shouldn't it be checking somewhat more regularly than that? Edit#3: developers completely missing the point on my comment. I'm not bothered about the notification. I'm bothered by the fact that the app appears to not be checking for exposure regularly, or is giving incorrect information about the frequency of checks. Happy to do some screenshots if contacted. Want the app to work.",
        "Does not work! My husband is isolating in our house after a confirmed positive covid test on 13/12/2020. It is now 16/12/2020 and I'm still waiting for the app to 'ping' and alert me... Yes we all have Bluetooth switched on. It is not safe, not fit for purpose and honestly dangerous as gives false information. Update 17/12/2020... Still not been notified but did get a text from track and trace. Regarding Bluetooth, maybe if the 'device' was inserted under my skin, then the app might work?",
        "Currently crashing whenever I open the app on my Pixel 3. It shows the \"NHS Covid19\" intro screen and then just crashes and asks me to send a bug report - which I have done practically every other day this week. Have tried empty the cache storage and reinstalling, but still it crashes. [updated] Just as I was putting a bug report together for the development team, it start working again. Have logged the problem with them (they seem quite responsive on here) and hopefully what I remember will help them for this issue for others.",
        "Not sure its checking correctly, it only seems to check exposure in the evening when I am home, when I've been out all day there are no exposure data requests and I work i a busy town. Why is no one sorting this App out there is clearly problems with it. Just o joke really and lame answers of an excuse.. No wonder people are having trust issues. Re written my review as still not checking when I am in the company of others.... I would give it a zero star but no option to do so......",
        "Edit... it seems to be working ok now after an update. It says my Samsung S10+ does not support the venue check-in feature. You would expect a modern high spec phone with the latest Android software and updates installed, to be compatible with the app. Yes the camera permission is set to 'allowed.",
        "There should be an option to manually check into a place without a QR Code & add the time visited. Without this the app is useless for times when you can't locate a QR Code/there isn't one or you have forgotten to scan it. I'm in tier 4, extremely vulnerable and HAD to collect Xmas food - there was no obvious QR Code at the shop, it was insanely busy & social distancing rules weren't being followed. The app completely failed as I had no way to check in at a time that the app was needed most.",
        "since national lockdown ended the app has not been working. I got repeated pop ups saying it had stopped working so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now I just get a hanging blue screen and it won't open. I have a Pixel 3 with Android 11. I reported this on 09/10 - nine days later and about to have a tier change & it still hangs on the loading screen.",
        "I had message saying to isolate for 3 days, I mean I am confused as I thought it was 10 or 14, so why is it now saying 3 days to go whwn only got the alert today.. I saw it needed update and now its not showing with needing to isolate, so no idea. I rang nhs 111 as the covid one wasn't open at the time at the time as I was abouting to start work at 3am, they wasn't sure as they aint heard of 3 days isolation. I don't care about going out, but want to work. Not liking this app its confusing",
        "My iPhone alerts me to updates but when I look at the app on my Android phone it is still the OLD version and when you go to the Google playstore to try and update it , it has no updates! Why does iPhone update and android doesn't? Clearly not helpful to someone who only has android and is using an out of date version. I tried the solution offered but it is already set up that way and no, it still doesn't auto update....you have to do it manually. Not very good at all really \ud83e\udd14",
        "It stopped working a several weeks ago. It was the fixed for a day or two and has stopped working again. I rated it 1 star here and all I get is a generic request to provide more details via the official website, which I did now twice. I keep updating as and when new versions appear, but as of now it still doesn't work. It's now 'off' for several weeks in which time my wife got warned by her app, but I cannot even open it. I wonder whether I should use the Scottish one instead?",
        "Good app. Much better than some of the other ones I have seen internationally. Good QR scanning speed and doesn't seem to drain the battery too much. Would be great if you could order coronavirus tests via the mail with this app. There is a requirement for them to fly with many countries and this would be a really useful feature.",
        "I might be wrong but I don't think the app has been checking my exposure since I downloaded it. Downloaded as soon as app was available and have been checking the exposure checks in android settings regularly... There were none ever since I downloaded in September. Assumed it was because I'd been keeping relatively isolated but decided to uninstall and reinstall app the other day and am now seeing regular exposure checks. Is this a known issue?",
        "Doesn't work any more. Download the app when requested to do so and worked fine for several weeks. Hasn't worked at all (Pixel 5 on Android) for a week or so now.... Thus utterly pointless and potentially putting me and my family at risk. Have uninstalled and reinstalled still no joy.",
        "What a waste of money this was. Rarely works properly and I keep getting false notifications that I've been exposed to someone tested positive to isolate. And how I know its false is because I'm literally sat at home when I get it and have not been anywhere and would of highly been unlikely it was any household member as no one I know has needed to be tested as yet. I must have had it about 5 times now, what a load if rubbish.",
        "Why does this app not update to the current information? Currently I am on the outskirts of greater London and am wondering whether my borough is in the new Tier 4. But I am told I am in tier 3 by the app. But according to news websites this is wrong. This is vital information that people need to know NOW! I have no confidence in this app.",
        "Had a notification, clicked on it for more info, it cleared the notification but gave no further detail. Now I can't see the notification! It said someone bear me had covid, but no idea on the advibe as the link didn't work. This means this app is now a one star. This has just happened again. I took a screenshot this time. Its definitely from the app but disappears when clicked on. Also the only way to contact yourselves is on here, which is frustrating."
