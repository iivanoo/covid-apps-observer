Life is easier if you are already registered on a GP system e.g. Patient Access, where you can find (without calling your GP practice) the details required by the NHS app, as an alternative to the blood-boiling route. If not already registered, you have my sympathy. Unfortunately, after successfully registering on the NHS app by the easier route, and using it successfully initially, it now repeatedly refuses to allow me to log on, telling me I;ve been inactive for 60 mins, so has logged me off. Brilliant! P.S. The above relates to desktop app, not Android. Apologies for the mistake. However Android app also will not let me log in. It says it now doesn't recognise the original regn details (from previously used Patient Access system), despite having previously accepted them and successfully opened accounts (for self + wife) on the NHS app. As invited, I will log a fault ticket.",

Why didn't it say so before I started and went through all the rigmorol? Not impressed. I looked back to where I saw the announcement... it said available for England and Wales! But in the small print on the NHS app site it said only available for people living in England. So a mixed message is going out. So how do I get my Wales version? It will probably say it's only available for people BORN in Wales!",
