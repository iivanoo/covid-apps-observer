        "I was doing fine with this app, getting messages and ringing people (I only do chats as I have no transport) but now I'm having problems. On my messages it's telling me I didn't accept tasks so they were passed on. I didn't know there were tasks waiting as I'm getting no alerts. I've checked all my settings etc and all are switched on, so not sure how to solve this. I'm still willing to call people who need it, but with no alerts coming in, I don't know tasks are waiting. Please advise.",
        "Don't like the icon always on display when on duty. It just adds unnecessary clutter to phone screen and more importantly means I'm less likely to spot an alert which is what the icon always meant. Please change this back or at least give users the option to switch off.",
        "It's hanging. Neither accept nor reject is possible. Update. I installed on a different phone and exactly the same problem exists on that. Therefore it's my account that is locked, not the app. How can I get my account working again? Uninstalled and restarted but the uninstall process is incomplete as when I reinstall and open it goes immediately to the same hanging task screen. I've Uninstalled it as its unuseable for me now.",
        "The notification alerts are limited to: 1.embarrasingly loud & protracted. 2. irritating as hell 3. difficult to hear The app itself works reasonably well but, having tried everything I can think of, I simply can't get it to remember my password I.e. no apparent option including via phone settings. All other apps give option to retain on installation. Tiresome logging in, therefore, which at times can be for remorseless alerts for assistance throughout the day. So, very poorly designed.",
        "Tried to register right now. Filled in my details and upon pressing the register button got the notification: \"Couldn't send the registration link to the email provided. Is the email correct?\" Yes, it is correct, because I used the \"Passwort forgotten\" button that send me a resetting link to the same email. Now I can't go through registration, since the registration link never reached my inbox but apparently the email did, because \"this email is in use\". \ud83d\ude44 Will give more stars later.",
        "Great idea the only problem k have at the moment is there's no buttons when I'm running a simulation",
        "Fundamentally sound but as a NHS volunteer responder there are two key niggles which could be addressed to make life much easier: 1. Unable to copy phone numbers from alerts to paste into the phone app, which means switching back and forth to type it manually. Can you make the number a link to dial directly or at least let it be copied to the clipboard? 2. Can't accept more than one task at a time so it's not possible to do them in one trip or make another call when the first isn't answered.",
        "The app is not loading the page my details is fully. Only showing my name, verifying organisation and expiry date. I cannot get the rest the page to load. I need access to this to be able adjust the notification alter by turning off the siren when I am going into a meeting at work. Please help..",
        "Load of rubbish. Was told by emergency Doctor from other side of my Borough to sign up to get a volunteer to collect my prescription. App wouldn't even let me state I was in the UK when registering. Tried several times. Give up. Response to developers: I was told to register by a gp to find a volunteer to collect a prescription/medication last night The App would not let me put the UK as my country! I am already registered with NHS First Responders. I get a call every couple of weeks.",
        "Since updating the app today to show on duty icon is on not been able to accept calls / help even though being alerted",
        "I've registered to volunteer at vaccination sites, received an email saying that they have noticed I hadn't taken up any opportunity, well that's because I haven't received any! Still receiving check in and chat and community response but nothing else.",
        "Doesn't pick up shifts within 25. Only when I'm in a big city and not from home base! Even though I live closer to the shifts being offered! Live in Skelton (North East Yorkshire). Don't get anything at all even for shifts at Redcar - though can see shifs at Redcar when I'm in Middlesbrough!",
        "Not going to leave a rating yet, I want to wait and see if my issue gets resolved and that this actually works first. Issue: No Email received!! Now that everything is sorted, the app works fine for me.",
        "Can we have a filter option by day of the week or time under future tasks, please? Sometimes with more than several hundreds on that list it is very difficult to find the relevant ones for VSS roles. Many thanks.",
        "Works for me. However, it would be nice to be able to list future tasks differently or offer sort by options.",
        "Brilliant have been able to help lots of people using this. Would like to know how to turn the volume for the siren down as very loud but other than that I have used it for over a year now with no problems.",
        "I've been logged in for over 1000 hours and never had a notification, even though I have all notification settings turned on. I've just gone into messages to find loads saying I've not responded to a request. How can I respond if the app isn't notifying me?",
        "After update app no longer opens. Re installed works once and then does not open again. Now unable to access to log on",
        "Attempted to register as a registered responder and 4 weeks later still waiting for it to be reviewed/approved. Nil other way to contact them.",
        "Been stuck on the loading screen for 4 days now...",
        "I sign on and then think it'll send notification but it hasn't been so someone sends a request I haven't received it so goes to the next responder I'll make sure I have it loaded more often now",
        "Because of this app i have been able to give people a second chance at life, i have attended many life changing calls and confirmed succesfull resusitation outcomes on a number of calls",
        "Version 12.8 on Android 10: looks like notifications may have been fixed, although now when I receive a task I get a \"double ding\" where my notification sound plays twice, almost over the top of itself. Still, this is better than silence. Some tasks still do not say what type of help is required until the \"accept\" button is clicked. UPDATE: forgot I had the \"bypass silent\" option on, was the only way I could receive alerts in prev. version. Yes, if off, I get one \"ding\" now as expected - thnx!",
        "I recieved a alert and was 1st on the scene to help out someone in the community. Everybody needs this app.",
        "Update: Thanks for your quick response. Although your suggestions didn't resolve the problem, they did nudge me to check elsewhere on the app. When it became possible to choose a notification other than Siren before xmas, I chose Default and that's where the problem is. I just did Push Notifications having selected Siren, then Pager, I got full notifications from both. I hope this helps you and others who have had simular problems. This is a question rather than a review. Why since the app was upgraded on the 2nd Jan 21 does my phone no longer get notifications? I do get the requests, but won't know unless I open the app and check messages/coms. The app notification screen has notifcations as On. Allow Dot Notifications is On. Under Categories The message is This app has not posted any notifications. A Push Notification Test did get received in Messages, but sadly no alerts. My phone is a Moto G5S using Oreio 8.0. There will be no more upgrades from Motorola.",
        "Edit: Thank you for clarifying and the quick response, that is working now! The app is not sending me notifications, I have been sent tasks but are missing them (even though I have been using my phone at the time the message is sent) because the app isn't sending my phone notifications. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times now and have checked notification and location permissions are allowed...",
        "I didn't find it very easy to install the app. It wouldn't work on my Android Tablet, so I did it on my phone but then it asked me to \"simulate an alert\" on my laptop as there would be no sound on my phone while the app was switched on. Then I disovered that I couldn't login on my laptop with my email and password because it seems I already have an account which I must have created when I registered as a volunteer early last year and which I had forgotten about, as I was never asked to volunteer. I am confused now about what to do and have spent nearly an hour trying to sort this out. I just want to help.",
        "The installation is clunky. If there's anything going to stop somewhere using an app, that'll be it. (I test and write software as a profession.) It's hard to scroll the page without hitting a selector (such as the country). The image crop allows only a square and could not set to the width of my driver's license, so part of the license was cut off. After several attemps of that, I was forced to select Work ID instead of Drivers License. And please fully capitalise countries' names! Edit: Thank you for your reply. I know how to use a camera. The image I was trying to use had the full driver's license - it was the cropping that did not allow me to use any more than 2/3 of the image that was previously taken by the camera. Edit 2: As noted, it can get into a state where a community responder cannot select 'drivetrs license. Was this app tested by devs?",
        "Upon installation, I can't seem to get past the initial introduction pages. The button at the bottom which says \"Ask for permissions\" does nothing when tapped. I've checked the permissions that the app has been granted in the application manager, and it has everything it needs. Phone is a Samsung J3 running Android 5.1.1. Update: Thanks to the team for updating this so quickly. All working perfectly now!",
        "Lack of clear instructions for new users. Lack of clarity as to what to do when alerted. No facility to indicate failure to contact helpee. Ear splitting siren alert. Responder photo spuriously rotated by 90 degrees. Poor graphics on responder der map - much too large. Code of conduct is incorrect for repurposed usage of the app and assumes physical attendance - also requires acknowledgement to a statement I cannot comply with to use app.",
        "The distance slider doesnt work properly. If I slide it to 25km, I go to another section of the app then come back to the distance and it has reset to a random distance. If I change it again, do something else and come back, the distance has reset to another random number. Quite infuriating and means it is not possible to set yourself as available in the correct radius. Samsung S8.",
        "Basic, but worked fine before. However, since Christmas time, push notifications are no longer working. The suggested solution to send a test notification or to check the FAQ is not helpful, as this does not fix the push notification issue (which is enabled as per instructions). You need to go into the app to see what the message is. If you miss the beep or are on silent, you would not know this unless you check the app every 10 mins. Developers need to resolve the notification issue with version 12.6 as this makes the app pretty much pointless.",
        "Update: issue now fixed with a distance slider on the 'me' tab, the app now works fine. ----- I am being inundated with requests that are far outside of the area I can reasonably travel. In the last 10 minutes I have had 31 requests to help, but all 5km-10km away. I have double checked that the app knows my location via the emailed link. I can't spend all day rejecting 3 requests a minute until I find one that is in a reasonable cycle/foot radius of my location.",
        "I think this app is poorly designed and poorly tested. I ended up turning it off. Shame because it's a good idea. There's overly loud alerts, and when you do get a notification there's no detail to decide whether to accept a task. Sometimes you get messages from the managers which can't be accessed.",
        "I used to get push notifications but don't anymore, I click on the app and there is a task waiting for me! I have checked all of my settings and they are fine, its just suddenly stopped working and I only see tasks when I open the app. I have tried sending a test notification but it didn't work and I have gone through all settings but can't see why it doesn't work.",
        "As others have reported since last week I have not been receiving the sound alerts and the app is now version 12.5 - I can choose the sound on the\"me\" page but even the simulated alert doesn't produce a sound. I have missed several alerts including a patient transport. I now have tested the push notification and this worked, so will wait to see what happens when I get a real alert. Thanks for the quick response.",
        "I have changed my phone and number. Went on to the suggested site to change the details and verified. I now have no location map nor able to simulate an alarm. I assume its not working. Tried to phone the help line for 4 hours, no answer. Usually take 5-10 calls a day but non received since. Please make it simpler.",
        "Absolute rubbish! Can't even register it keeps saying an email has been sent when I didn't even put my email address in anywhere and there is nothing in my emails including my spam, so I deleted the app and re installed it, tried again with an email address this time and it says you already have an account and to go to email to accept. But there is NO EMAIL! So frustrating!",
        "This app worked very well with my previous Android 10. Since upgrading my phone to a new Android 10, I stopped getting sound notifications. I followed your FAQs, allowed all permissions, but I still don't get them as sound alert. I used to have a sound notification for a simulated task, but I don't get it now. Can you help please as I may miss request if I don't look on the screen...",
        "Buggy, clunky UI. Clicking on 'Show details' of a booked task closes the app every time. The details can only be seen by restarting the app. No way to go back to the homepage without clicking back through every page of the 'tasks' section. Can't copy text, eg task addresses. User unfriendly."
