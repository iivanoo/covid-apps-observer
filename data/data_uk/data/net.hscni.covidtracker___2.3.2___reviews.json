If you just search for 'stopcovid NI' the app does not appear in the search results at all.

Ignore Jonathan S.'s troll review; this app uses the much more privacy focused decentralised model (compared to centralised model that people may have heard the UK were perusing some months ago). This means means that the data collected is very limited, and in fact, the app clearly lays out and explains what data is and isn't collected up-front. (Note to the developers: I'm not sure how the Google Play store search works, but I found this app very hard to find... In fact, I need to use a direct link. Searching all variations of \"StopCOVID NI\" only brought back the other HSC \"COVIDCare\" app, which could easily confuse people looking for this contact tracing app. Given that most downloads will be soon after initial release and announcement, I hope this is fixed soon for the sake of greater uptake.)",
