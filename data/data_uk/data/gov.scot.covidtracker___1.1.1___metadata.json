        "I have been in close contact with someone who tested positive and uploaded their details. They were in an identical position. Neither of us received any notification. I have been working all through this pandemic, use public transport every day, no notifications. I suspect this app is a gimmick to make us feel better. It's pointless and should be deleted. Wash your hands, keep your distance, wear your mask, isolate if symptoms appear. This app is rubbish.",
        "Stopped working for god knows how long and only realised today it stopped until it got an update. My partner and I thought its working and now he's covid positive and ppl who otherwise would be protected through the app are at risk. We did contact tracing but we had to visit 3 shops and thats where we probably picked up infection despite masks and hand hygiene etc. Im just disappointed it didn't work when I thought I ve done whats needed.",
        "The app has stopped performing checks. Go into your phone's settings, find and check your Covid Exposure Notifications section, and make sure your app is making checks. Mine hasn't done any in at least 2 weeks, probably much longer. Asked a friend with a totally different model of phone to check theirs - same issue. I emailed the app developers a week ago, no reply. Looks like I'm not the only one judging by these reviews either. Not sure what's going on but with the new spike, this is dangerous",
        "Easy install, anonymous and unobtrusive. No personal details required. Get alerted if you have been in close contact with anyone recently testing positive. What you choose to do then is up to you. Similarly if you have a positive test, you choose to allow the app/system. A win-win for everyone, and it will help restrict and limit any spread. Update: 31st Jan 20: The app/system works. My partner got a +ve test result this morning. She entered her code and I was notified a few hours later.",
        "Had stopped doing exposure checks on my phone over a month ago. I just happened to check the app when I had to turn my Bluetooth off and on again whilst pairing headphones. Got the notification from the app to turn Bluetooth back on, when I clicked it it showed no exposure checks had been done since 28th November! I have had Bluetooth and location on the whole time so must be a fault that stopped it checking. Checked my husbands phone, same issue, had not checked for exposure since September!",
        "Exposure Notifications don't update. Used to check for exposure several times a day, now it's once a week. If that. Useless. Just saw another review stating turning Bluetooth off and on forces a key update. This is a fact!! What's happening here?!",
        "Absolutely useless, my wife and myself all had Covid. Despite entering details on the app on both our phones we received zero notifications. Other close relatives also received zero notifications despite close contact. Not fit for purpose.",
        "I have had no problems with this app what-so-ever. It even worked while I was in England. You may have to go into your Google setting and turn on the track and trace option if Bluetooth doesn't work straight away.",
        "Update: appear to be getting daily exposure updates now. Will give the app another try. I have had zero response from the developer.",
        "By chance checked my exposure notifications in Google settings, only to find it hadn't checked for 11 days. Contacted Others and so far 37 people have the same issue of varying timescales with no checking. Longest is 36 days. This seems like a major flaw.",
        "With the ease of putting this app onto my phone, to the knowledge that it can be carried around undetected, unlike a mask or other type of guard, you have a back-up protection that has already been proven to alert people who would otherwise not have known that they had been in contact with a Covid 19 positive person. Most folk just see it as yet another app on their phone, when in actual fact it's a LIFE SAVER.",
        "Exposure notification has not been updated since the 8th of December. This is the 31st at time of writing. I assume for 23 days i have had no protection from this app. Seems absolutely pointless.",
        "I've been diagnosed with Covid, have been given a code, however when I try to input it into the App, the code is too long. So it doesn't work. Pointless",
        "Discovered that it hadn't been working for 3 weeks. Updated the app and it carried out 2 exposure checks then stopped working again. Pointless having it especially when working in education and having lots of contacts daily.",
        "DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. App is getting deleted!!! Had it from the get go and for some reason it decided to stop checking for contacts a few weeks ago. Anyway, installed the new app today and received a close contact notification. I have now been told by NHS Scotland contact tracers that it is up to me whether to self isolate or not!!!! Whats then point in having the app if thats the case?",
        "Following the latest update It appears my phone had turned off the exposure notifications switch in settings / Google/ covid-19 exposure notifications. What is worrying was / is the Protect Scotland app did not notify me in any way, until I happened to open the app by chance and only then did a warning appear. Why doesn't the app generate a warning every time it tries to check or update it's database ? It seems a very basic failing. \u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude33 Also why no exposure checks reported anymore ?",
        "Had this app since it came out worked great, however since the update it never works. One scan done in the last 14 days. Disappointed no wonder the numbers are rising.",
        "Periodically tells me that Bluetooth is turned off, even when (as far as I can see) it's not...",
        "Has only done 1 exposure check in 14 days which was the check I kicked off after the last time I checked and it also hadn't performed any checks in weeks. App is broken, needs fixed",
        "This app has stopped working and no notifications reported since early December. This software is supposed to help keep us safe !!! This is scandalous. FIX IT !!!!!",
        "Doesn't carry out exposure checks, I had the entire month of November with 0 checks carried out, uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Worked for two weeks before stopping checks again. Completely pointless if it just gathers keys but doesn't carry out any exposure checks.",
        "Works well and isn't disruptive. Didn't have any exposure alerts, and hopefully never will.",
        "Been out every day at work etc in many different locations and last scan done was 8 days ago?? 1 in the past 14 days, this is a waste of time.......",
        "Was working for a while but not performed a check since 16th December 2020 despite always being on.",
        "Easy to use no problems except for the battery so had to use a back up facility",
        "Total garbage. Walk around all day with an 'open' phone? Not going to happen. Most people only want the most basic information. All that takes is a browser and a postcode.",
        "Good idea but drains battery extremely fast. Cant be in public spaces anymore than an hour with it on or my phone dies",
        "Very easy to install and set up. Just leave it to do its job and for us to do ours by following the golden rules of FACTS. thank you.",
        "Won't install. When I click next after accepting T&C it says I'm not connected to the Internet. Could it be because I have the covid tracker program installed? Turns out if you have a VPN installed it will not work.",
        "Absolute waste! Our family have been through so much and to find out after 3 weeks they had been exposed was the evidence needed to delete the app!!",
        "Absolutely useless; people who are positive are going to go out with app running and Bluetooth on? REALLY? Dumbfounded that anyone even tried to use this Uninstalling....",
        "No exposure checks in the last 14 days, yet I've had bluetooth & location switched on.",
        "Used to check for exposure 3 times a day, now it's about once a week.",
        "Thankfully not used it yet but well constructed and easy to understand",
        "Doesn't work , my son tested positive and I'm still waiting on app telling me I have been in close contact",
        "On my phone 24\u00d77 - and on yours too, right? Never causes any perceivable problems.",
        "No alert to update of app. Thought this might have been a basic essential.",
        "This is the first time I've sat in for a meal this year. I feel reassured having this app.",
        "Parents with 2 kids in their 20s living in the same house, all four had the app but none of them were alerted when the son tested positive for covid",
        "Relying on Bluetooth my phone is constantly connected to my smart watch \u231a so how can the app work then ?"
