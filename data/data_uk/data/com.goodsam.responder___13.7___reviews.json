See Richard M's review below as an example. Yet the photo of the AED allows for any size and shape crop. So the developers have figured out how to allow an any size crop for selecting one photo, but don't want to apply that to another? I'm betting that the reason I can't save my AED location is because the app doesn't just select a photo, it selects and forces a crop, and in cropping it, it probably loses the location data that is in the Exif information that I have confirmed is embedded in the original photo.",

Although your suggestions didn't resolve the problem, they did nudge me to check elsewhere on the app. When it became possible to choose a notification other than Siren before xmas, I chose Default and that's where the problem is. I just did Push Notifications having selected Siren, then Pager, I got full notifications from both. I hope this helps you and others who have had simular problems. This is a question rather than a review. Why since the app was upgraded on the 2nd Jan 21 does my phone no longer get notifications? I do get the requests, but won't know unless I open the app and check messages/coms. The app notification screen has notifcations as On. Allow Dot Notifications is On. Under Categories The message is This app has not posted any notifications. A Push Notification Test did get received in Messages, but sadly no alerts. My phone is a Moto G5S using Oreio 8.0.

        "content": "UDATED REVIEW 25/04/20: I had tried updating the app to the latest version (11.1) by allowing Google Play to carry out the update automatically. Unfortunately this did not fix the issue. However after receiving the reply to my review from GoodSAM LTD I tried uninstalling the app completely then downloading and reinstalling afresh. This seems to have fixed the issue and the latest version is as of now working smoothly. If anyone else is having similar problems to me it may be worth trying uninstalling and reinstalling the the latest version rather than allowing it to update itself automatically. I have adjusted my rating accordingly and appreciate the response to my somewhat hasty review. Thanks GoodSAM. **********************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 24/04/20: Was working before the latest update. Now it does not work at all. It just crashes or gives an erroneous message about poor internet connection. This message is complete rubbish as we have a very fast broadband connection and strong mobile data signal where I live. Funnily enough no other apps or devices in my household are having internet connection issues. I realise this is a very difficult time but my kid brother can write more reliable and functional apps than this! Honestly this app is nowhere near fit for purpose yet.",

Unfortunately, after several weeks of working fine, I reported the app stopped working today and was advised this is a Google app/android issue that is being dealt with, but I still can't get the app to work. Asked if I uninstall and then reinstall will I lose my volunteer hours, but this remains unanswered. *All is working fine now. The auto update needed uploading manually. I didn't lose any volunteer hours either. :)",

I work in User Experience and am happy to help you, feel free to contact me. 1) When I receive an alert that my help is needed, it simply asks me to 'ACCEPT' or 'REJECT'. I need to know what the request is for before I can respond. 2) I load the app and toggle 'on' my availability. If I click the app sometime later, it seems to load from scratch with my availability toggled 'off'. I need the app to be explicit to me about how my availability is managed. Does my 'availability on' state persist even when the app is no longer running? If so, tell me. If so, make it persist when I reload the app. As it stands, it feels as though my availability has somehow expired because it is toggled off when I reload the app. 3) Android asks me if the app can see my location 'while the app is loaded' or 'all the time'. I want to minimise the amount of location data I share with apps. Make it clear to me what I should select in this context and why.",

The process insists on some document I don't have and it wont let me passed that stage. I rang the Support team who said that no-one else was having problems??? and that I should try to uninstall the app and reinstall it. I have tried that but the app just tells me it's installed.

There seems to be absolutely minimal online support available either. Sorry for sounding like know-it-all project manager (I've rolled out more than my fair share of IT applications in my time), but to deploy to 750k people with no designated online support resources available seems absolutely crazy.

The email explains the app has been repurposed for the Corvid-19 crisis, and it was previously used to alert off-duty medics about cardiac arrest. It is currently being updated. Yes the app is a bit clunky, it asks for too many permissions, and the wording incorectly implys a first aid aspect. But the fact it exists and is ready to organise a team of volunteers is something to be thankful for.",

The link isnt working on tablet and i tried on desktop it says site cant be found. This is completely hopeless. Link is not working on my devices including phone. I am now in a complete rage having spent most of this morning trying to get this working. Have tried every device and even tried to re register with new password saying I had forgotten old one. Sent link to pit in new password which I did and this is not being accepted. I am now going to give up. This is the most disfunctional technology I have ever encountered and at a time of crisis.",

        "content": "I do appreciate that being made the official NHS Corona Virus volunteer app will have put a huge strain on the GoodSam team. However, the app as it stands is not really fit for this purpose. I've yet to find a downloadable instruction document or Youtube video that explains how NHS Responders should use an app that was not initially designed with them in mind. The key issues: The On-Duty toggle switch. The instructions for emergency responders say you need to be 'on duty' to get calls, yet when you switch it on it says \"this option will have no effect\" - Huh? Am I therefore always on duty? Or never on duty?! If you switch it 'off' it says \"You'll still be notified of nearby cardiac arrests\" which brings me to the next point: It remains an emergency services app The language in the app assumes I'm part of the emergency services. I have no medical qualifications - I don't want to be dispatched to a cardiac arrest! I also don't want to be forced to click a button which says I know first aid! I wouldn't know which end of the patient was which! Similarly, the default notification tone is an ear-splitting emergency siren (seriously - the loudest noise my phone has ever made) and there is no alternative option. If I were being called to save a life it's understandable, but I'm expecting to be asked to pick up Tesco's shopping! For now, my phone is staying on silent, lest I be the one to have a heart attack! Volunteering Options As some other people have mentioned, there is no way to see (or change) the volunteering types you are signed up to do. If i can't leave the house today, but could do companionship volunteering over the phone, there is no way to indicate that. It's also unclear how I fulfill my duties as an equipment and supplies transport volunteer when the app says I'll only be called to events a few streets away. My local hospital is nearby, but farther than a few streets. Goodsam - Please tweak the current app to address these points, or if that's not possible in the time-frame available, please bring out a quick PDF or video to explain how to use the app effectively as it stands!",

Here I am, keen to pitch in, have registered, been accepted, told to download the app, logged in, go to sing on duty and told that button doesn't apply. So how DO I let the system know when I can clock-in? Also, was told to download this app - yet seems to think I am a qualified first responder. My first aid certificate ran out years ago, I was expecting to be doing prescription deliveries, welfare calls and so on. Would suggest that at LEAST the app should allow you to select / de-select the type of calls you are able to help with, rather than have to accept a call, then decide if you can do it - before either dropping it or \"hoping for the best\". As I say, great initiative and worthwhile cause - but VERY misleading app.",
