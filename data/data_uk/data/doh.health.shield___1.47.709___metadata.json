        "Doesn't work most of the times. It used to work earlier and showed me the vaccine and covid results; now its just stuck at the splash screen. Tried reinstalling; doesn't work.",
        "This just shows if your system is not capable enough then you shouldn't try this experiment, especially how rude and rough treatment you get while crossing the Abu Dhabi border. I have got our result through SMS but the same is not updated, its been almost 44 Hrs post test but the same is not updated on Al Hosn app. If the result is not updated on the App then we'll have to conduct a test again. It's quite unfortunate the way things are being handled here in UAE.",
        "I understand that this app was developed on emergency and probably it's team didn't have enough time to engineer it well because nobody expected covid but it's very glitchy even for that! It's almost 4 months after vaccination and my results still show incorrectly! It only shows one dose! And I'm so tired of calling Seha and Healthpoint and all support contacts I can find all to no avail!",
        "App will not show my vaccine and the phone does not work the email bounces and the border is a pain in the neck ... get the app to work or stop using",
        "My vaccine details is not updated. I had my vaccines January 20 & February 10 respectively. But until now it shows only \"Fist dose 10 Feb\" How come?!! I tried calling the hot line number but failed to connect numerous times. Even sending emails is a failure coz every time i send it comes back saying can't receive emails as its full. ?????",
        "The application doesn't allow for updating my phone number and hence it is giving me error, no one is helping, very poor customer services, no one is picking up the phone and the emails are bouncing back!",
        "App is not working after the new update on 14 March. The checkpoint will not take anything other than the results from Al Hosn app. There is no backup method to gain entry to the checkpoint other than using this app. When I try to access this app as of right now on 23 March it's telling me I need an internet connection which I already have because of my mobile data. Fix it!",
        "My test results were not updated. Tried emailing the help desk, the email bounced back as the mailbox was full. Tried WhatsApp,but just got generic messages which were unhelpful. Tried contacting the 800 HOSN number, but was unable to connect in spite of being on hold for over 45 minutes about 3 times during the day. Then tried calling the 800 WEQAYA number which was again unreachable. Then tried sending a DM on Instagram which again went unanswered. All options for support exhausted.",
        "The idea behind the app is fantastic. In practical terms it has some errors. I've had both vaccine shots but only one shows up on my app. I'm not sure how to change this as I've sent the pdfs to the developer.",
        "The app is not opening when connected via cellular data. I only get a screen with ALHOSN written. But it opens and connects well when connected via WiFi, why?? At the health center we have to use cellular data and that where the problem starts. Tried everything but still it doesn't work via cellular data connection.",
        "App does not update with PCR result. Even if you 'manually' send your test result there is no action taken. It's been a month since my test and the result still hasn't updated. The hotline is simply non-operational. I've been on hold for a collective four hours, our of which my call was attended ONCE, And I guess the agent did not speak English and I did not speak arabic to he 'transferred' me to another line (the line was dropped promptly) I just want to visit my family in Abu Dhabi. Please give me a solution.",
        "This App has a lot of flaws. It needs more attention from developer. I tried to use my phone number but it's saying that it's not registered and the app suggested to use another number which is exactly the number I used in the first place. How is that possible?",
        "This is app is good but customer service is not good. I tried to contact them via call and email but they never pick the call and mail never delivered to their email. They should provide quick and good service to users.",
        "This app creating more trouble than help!!!!! After receiving SMS with the PCR test results in the app my results updating chaotically, somethimes within few hours sometimes not updating FOR DAYS! Which causes so much trouble while crossing Dubai - Abu Dhabi border, as they now only looking at the results via this app and don't care about official SMS from hospitals. The App CALL CENTER IS THE WORST! They just dropping the line if you complain and telling you it's not their problems whatsoever!",
        "Test results were not updated. Test done on 14th, results came through msg and mail with in 10 hours. But its going to be 48 hours this app is not updating my result and Iam not able to enter Abu Dhabi. Worst service. They won't respond to any call, mails will bounce back... What should I do??? Still waiting...",
        "My Second dose result is missing on the app even though I am finished with the second dose on March 13. How am I able to travel now if my second dose result is not showing in my app? I have also taken PCR too. Fix this issue for the convenience of many. Do not give us a trouble upon travelling. This app is always making a problem.",
        "The covid test results does not get reflected on the app sometimes. Before they had feature within the app to request for the result to be shown on the app but now I cannot find it... Call center Phone doesn't work Emails bounce back (undelivered)",
        "It's a useful tool and it certainly works. My app wasn't working. Initially I restarted my mob to see it works but gave the same error. Then I uninstalled the app and reinstalled the app. It finally worked as it gets the updated information. Now both dose info is displayed on the Al Hosn app. Give it a try.",
        "I did my last pcr test on 13th March 2021 and I already received message stating 'negative' but why in the application its not getting updated. If it will be like this we won't be able to make travel between abu dhabi and dubai as at the border they are checking only the Al Hosn App to gain entry into Abu Dhabi Emirate... and I have noticed many of my colleagues are facing the same trouble. Even multiple times we tried to reinstall the app still doesn't work.",
        "When you change the phone (hardwear), you can't copy the app or its history. It will keep crashing. You will be like that ork, carrying a dead baby on its back = old phone around to show your PCR / DPI and vaccination history. So bad, but no choice.",
        "I have been covid tested two days back, no results or updates have been received in al hosn app. I didnt even received any sms regarding the same. I tried contacting the tollfree numbers, but no response. Worst experience.",
        "my covid pcr results are not appearing in the app.i tried uninstall/install still not appearing.i have been calling al hosn technical 8004676 since yesterday it is very hard to get through.i was able to talk to a support.i was advised that it will take one week.seriously.one week?and the lady hung up on me!!!!yes she hung up on me!!!!impossible to talk to someone on your hotline but when i got the chance your staff will not be of help and the worst is will hang up the call.",
        "I've tested PCR test recently, i've got message on my phone. But the result wasn't appearing on the app. Though my previous 4 times test results were already showing in the app. But it's been several days but the recent result isn't showing at all.",
        "My app is not working, it only show results of the DPI. I have called, emailed, deleted and re-installed the app and nothing works. Government needs the app to cross the checkpoint and its placing unnecessary stress on me as I fear I will not be able to go to work. My colleagues apps is working fine. It looks like I have excuses to go to work. Please help \ud83d\ude4f",
        "After download it just shows a blank screen with AlHosn written. Not sure what kind of bug this is but would be great if they looked into it. Since this is the most improtant app for vaccines, least it could do is work.",
        "The vaccination takes ages to be updated. Pcr from private hospital never appear till I upload it manually. How long it takes for vaccination to appears? Also the update is very bad and I keep on getting msg that I need to contact WiFi or data but then I get error msg. Now its keeps crashing and not working in android!",
        "My 2nd dose vaccination date still not showing even I'm done it last 6th February 2021. That is why up to now I cannot experience the letter E on this application. As to when it will be updated, I don't know. Hoping to see and appear the update. Thank you.",
        "The app just does not update. I have already received the test results and I am still waiting for the app to display the needed updates. Customer service line was not answering, emails were rejected, and no responses from social media. It is such an inconvenience.",
        "There is no option for complaint or even send feedback. I did my PCR test on WED and got the result on Friday. The system shall count the first day of the RESULT DAY not the TEST DAY. ???????????? The 48 hours OR the 2 days is on the service provider not the customer, why to be reflected as I received the result???",
        "It used to be excellent and fast and very officiant, but unfortunately it keeps on laying and shutting down now, I tried force stopping and deleting cash and reinstalling and updating it, still the same issues. Even when I try to report or send feedback, it lags even more. Please find a solution \ud83d\ude4f",
        "can you please make little bit more faster sending OTP because its takes too much time to received and i already try resend code but still too much time then once i closed the app because i already trying it around 30 minutes then those  OTP just arrived and it can't be used and now again waiting for that OTP",
        "COVID vaccine status not updated 2 months after the second shot. Unable to reach anyone on helpline because all calls get stuck on automated message in Arabic. Emails bounce back because inbox is full!?! Non existing support for app that works partially and is required by Government.",
        "The app crashes most of the time. Also, it doesn't show that I am already vaccinated even though I already had my 2nd vaccine more than a month ago I get tested every less than 7 days and the others who don't even get tested often, it shows they are vaccinated.",
        "Horrible the app does not update, I can't get through customer service or technical support. The one time I got through they did not even trouble shoot just told me to call the clinic and hung up literally. I have done everything what is expected even reached whats app no one helps .",
        "Was working fine. But suddenly stopped, crashing at the splash screen showing internet not available, even though i am connected to wifi and mobile data. Tried in few of my friends phone, they too facing same issue.",
        "After having my second dose this 1st of April the app stopped working showing couldn't load users information. Good I have the vaccination card with me. What if I don't? What about those who don't have it? Please fix it ASAP you don't know the frustration and hassle this will bring to those who's relying on this app.",
        "I have tried installing the app many many times but it does not work and closes down by itself each time I try to open it on my Samsung note 8. I could not find any advice to troubleshoot this issue.",
        "It is impossible to reach alhosn. Emails bounce back, no assistance on phone. My test results always are late to load, one from Thursday still nor registered on app 3 days later. My wife's 2nd dose of vaccine still not showing on app 28days after. Tried unistalling and reinstalling - nothing. This is an essential app to ease the crossing of boarder, but creates confusion and stress not wondering if this morning they will allow me to cross.",
        "technical service is horrible. you wont be able to get in touch on any number or any social media accounts. the report dosent show or gets updated. too much bugss",
        "Horrible experience. The customer service does not pick and even if by your luck they pick they dont have a solution......if you start speakimg in english after selecting the english theyl say no english and cut the call.....the app has not updated my pcr results which are valid only fr 2 days....really dissapointed"
